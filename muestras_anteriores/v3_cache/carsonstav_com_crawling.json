Show Caption 1 of 3 Shown is the exterior of Carson's Woodside Tavern at 57 Route 9P in Malta. Expand By Lauren Halligan | lhalligan@troyrecord.com | The Saratogian UPDATED: July 22, 2021 at 12:55 PM EDT MALTA>> A longstanding lakeside restaurant has changed hands and new traditions are now being made at Carson’s Woodside Tavern. Located at 57 Route 9P in Malta, the space was formerly known as Cliff’s Country Inn. The longtime business, once owned by Cliff and Kathy Barlow, closed its doors in January after 37 years of continuous operation. The establishment was purchased by Carson Greiner, LLC earlier this year and the brand new Carson’s Woodside Tavern opened last month. The new bar and restaurant has a totally revamped interior, a new chef and a fresh menu (with some old favorites from Cliff’s). Local resident Bill Carson, the former owner and operator of Ravenswood Restaurant in Clifton Park for nearly 30 years, is one of four partners in the new family-owned and run enterprise. Carson serves as general manager and is delighted to be working with his wife, Susie, daughter Stephanie, who is now bar manager, and his future son-in-law executive chef Mike Cunningham, who formerly served as kitchen manager at Ravenswood. Carson’s son Ryan will assist in the kitchen in the center line position as well. Co-owners Gail and April Greiner-Hammond from Syracuse are also part of the family and key players on the Carson’s Woodside Tavern team. Gail will oversee all current and future renovation work and April will serve as website and social media manager. “It’s definitely a family effort,” Susie Carson said. Together, the family is set on making Carson’s Woodside Tavern a success. Bill Carson was looking for another business opportunity and when Cliff Barlow personally called and asked him about purchasing the space, Carson knew he had found it. Sitting on a four-acre plot of land, Carson’s Woodside Tavern has a large indoor dining area, as well as patio seating with an incredible, newly-cleared view of Saratoga Lake. “It’s pretty out there,” Susie Carson said, “and we want to take advantage of it.” “We see not only the restaurant, but we see the property as an asset,” Bill Carson agreed. In addition to offering quality food and service, “We have a vision for the property as well,” he said. The family plans to expand the restaurant’s deck to incorporate an outdoor bar, fire pits and summer entertainment, all with a lakeview. The Carson’s Woodside Tavern menu is a combination of bestselling items from Ravenswood, Cliff’s Country Inn and some new ideas from chef Cunningham, who most recently worked as executive sous chef at Beekman Arms in Rhinebeck. The most popular dishes so far are fish and chips, WTF! (Woodside Tavern Favorite) wings, and the slow-roasted prime rib, which was a Cliff’s staple. The Woodside sandwich, made with prime rib, bacon, aged cheddar cheese and horseradish, is another favorite. Different, creative weekly specials are on the menu every Friday and Saturday, too. During the week guests can enjoy happy hour from to 6 p.m., with and extended happy hour on Mondays that is offered until closing time. The seasonal drink menu, which features a summer sangria, was recently unveiled and is gaining popularity as temperatures rise. On Friday and Saturday nights, Carson’s Woodside Tavern has live entertainment from 8 to 11 p.m. featuring a variety of local musicians. The Carsons’ goal in opening the tavern is to be a longstanding, community-focused local hotspot. “We’re looking to be here for many many years to come,” Bill Carson said. “We’re hospitality-oriented. We want to know our customers names. It’s very important to us.” Carson’s Woodside Tavern is open seven days a week for lunch and dinner. Hours are 11 a.m. to midnight Monday through Saturday and noon to 11 p.m. on Sundays. The restaurant will hold its grand opening celebration on the evening of Saturday, June 13, with live music by Franklin Micare. Funds raised at the event will benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation. For more information and event details visit www.carsonswoodside.com or call the restaurant at 584-9791. Lauren Halligan may be reached at 290-1443.
