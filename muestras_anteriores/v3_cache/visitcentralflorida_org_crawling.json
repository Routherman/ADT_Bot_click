      "text": "Who we are – Mosaic Skip to content Mosaic Boosting the collective power of the environmental movement across climate, conservation, and environmental health and justice. Who we are Our impact Our grantmaking Funding partners The latest Who we are WHO WE ARE Mosaic is a national funder and field catalyst that boosts the collective power of climate, conservation, and environmental health and justice movements in the United States to achieve durable, population-scale wins. A participatory grantmaker governed by a Leadership Council of grassroots, nonprofit, and philanthropy movement leaders, Mosaic supports the connectivity and shared tools — also known as movement infrastructure — advocates and activists need to build and exercise power across demographics, geographies, and issue silos. Our History Mosaic was created in response to a collective recognition that, although the U.S. environmental movement has achieved historic victories, the pace and scale of the challenges we face demand even more of all of us. More than 100 NGO, philanthropy, and academic leaders from diverse organizations across the country participated in an 18-month design process that launched Mosaic in 2020 with seed funding from the Hewlett, Packard, Walton Family, and Pisces Foundations. These leaders unanimously confirmed that stronger movement infrastructure is indispensable to enable the environmental movement to take advantage of its strengths — like size — and diminish its weaknesses — like unproductive competition and inequitable access to funding. Our Team Mosaic is led by a diverse constellation of environmental and justice leaders and supported by a small staff. Leadership Council Angela Mahecha Adrar Tishman Environment and Design Center, The New School Angela Mahecha Adrar is the Program Director of the Environmental Justice Movement Fellowship.
