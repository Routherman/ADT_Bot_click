Originally constructed in 1917 as the Rivoli Theatre, the RITZ Ybor underwent various renovations in the 1930s to expand and become the Ritz Theatre. Over the decades, it has transformed from a silent movie theatre to a playhouse, nightclub, and now a premier concert venue. In 2008, it officially reopened as the RITZ Ybor, showcasing its rich history and modern features. Situated in the heart of the historic Ybor City district, the RITZ Ybor is just a short trolley ride away from the Water Street district, within 2-3 miles from downtown Tampa, and is only a 15-minute car ride from the Tampa International Airport. Since its reopening in 2008, the RITZ Ybor has hosted high-profile events such as Super Bowl parties, national product launch parties, and sold-out concerts from acclaimed artists like Lady Gaga, Imagine Dragons, Kendrick Lamar, Skrillex, and more. Sunset Events has made the RITZ Ybor its home since 2016, further cementing the venue’s status as a leading destination for unforgettable live music and special events in Tampa. The RITZ Ybor is located at 1503 East 7th Avenue in Tampa, FL. ABOUT SUNSET EVENTS For over 2 decades, Sunset Events has dominated the dance music industry with top events, festivals, and promotions in Tampa Bay and Central Florida. Owner John Santoro started this endeavor back in 1995, and Sunset Events has produced over 150 events each year along with its annual music festival, Sunset Music Festival . Sunset Events has featured hundreds of world-class artists: Tiësto, Deadmau5, Skrillex, Illenium, Excision, The Chainsmokers, Zedd, Above & Beyond, RL Grime, NF, 21 Savage, Porter Robinson, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, Paul van Dyk, Armin Van Buuren, Paul Oakenfold, Benny Benassi, Carnage, 6lack, Juice Wrld, Oliver Heldens, Adventure Club, Dillon Francis, Borgore, Zeds Dead, Malaa, Slander, NGHTMRE, Pauly D, Flosstradamus just to name a few.

The end result looks good – many thanks. ADRIAN SHAH-CUNDY, VOLKER WESSELLS All looks fantastic thank you!! The guys were a pleasure to meet and it was all so hassle free. CHARLOTTE WALTERS, TUNGSTEN NETWORK Commissioned Logovisual to design and install a folding wall in one of our technology rooms. Both our company and the NHS Trust were absolutely delighted with the installation a first for all. PETER SALT, IMMERSIVE Clear and prompt communication throughout and a very smooth installation process. Nothing was too hard. Highly recommended! TRACEY COVE, STEVENS & COVE Excellent, high quality product, purchased after wise advice and installed quickly by friendly installers. Perfect product for our meeting room needs. MIA ELLIOTT, DIOCESE OF GUILDFORD The board looks great! And I’d like to say your installers were absolutely fantastic, so friendly, organised and cleaned up. JESS MARTIN, VAYNERMEDIA Logovisual really understood our brief and made some great suggestions to make our designs come to life. They helped us bring a child’s game from a small tin to a life size piece of experiential, for us to take in to store at John Lewis. Everyone loved it. Thank you guys. TAMARA SPURWAY, WILD & WOLF As a product, they really provide a varied functionality to aid in our brainstorming and project works.

THE PROJECT TEAM, OVERBURY PLC The product itself is superbly built and easy to manoeuvre around with the attached wheels. From the office team’s communication before our event to the delivery team’s installation and pickup I found everyone to be really helpful and very professional going out of their way to meet our deadlines. I would certainly recommend logovisual. SHAUN O’HARA, SAATCHI & SAATCHI WELLNESS We were looking for a new “canvas” to share information and encourage joint thinking. The Thinking Wall turned out to be the perfect solution. There’s room to be expansive and for things to have real impact. The service we received right from our first enquiry, to installation (very fast, very painless) has been excellent.
