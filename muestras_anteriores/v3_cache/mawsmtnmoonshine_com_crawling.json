View All Testimonials Mount Dora Boating Center is amazing! Dustin and the staff were friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and made the entire experience from the beginning of the process of reserving the boat to getting on the water extremely smooth. My family and I had a great time. If you enjoy boating and being on the water, MDBC is the place to go! Anthony Ards Best experience. Nice, clean place with lots of boats to choose. Wonderful and helpful staff. Highly recommend! Michelle “Shelley” Stepp Julia and her staff were amazing to work with! They have fantastic rental craft with superior customer service. The ins and outs of our particular boat were throughly explained to us, we were given a map of the Chain of Lakes, and they were waiting for us when we returned to help us dock the boat. They even have complimentary beach carts to use so you don’t have to lug all of your gear to and from the parking lot. Every detail has been thought of by this group, highly recommend! Elite Veterinary Home Care Our family rented a pontoon boat this past weekend. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful. The boat was clean, fueled and ready to go. Great weekend thanks to Mount Dora Boating Center. Scott Leeds Did an all day Saturday rental of a Starcraft CX 23 pontoon boat and loved it. Excellent service and excellent equipment.

STEP INSIDE AND YOU’LL FEEL LIKE YOU’VE WANDERED INTO A MOUNTAIN KITCHEN—WHERE THE FLOORS MIGHT CREAK, THE JARS ARE ALWAYS FULL, AND SOMEONE’S PROBABLY TELLIN’ A STORY THAT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME THEY TELL IT. IT’S MORE THAN JUST MOONSHINE—IT’S A TRIBUTE TO THE FOLKS WHO DID IT FIRST, THE RIGHT WAY. AND IF YOU LISTEN REAL CLOSE, YOU JUST MIGHT HEAR MAW IN THE BACK, STIRRIN’ UP A FRESH BATCH… FOR STRICTLY MEDICINAL PURPOSES, OF COURSE. MEET THE FAMILY Our family may have soaked up the Florida sunshine for over fifteen years, but the Appalachian Mountains will always be home. We come from a long line of moonshiners—folks who were making the good stuff deep in the hills of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia for generations. When you visit Maw’s, don’t miss the picture on the wall. It shows three generations of our moonshining kin—the roots of every jar we make today. Just like the family before us, we welcome everyone to come sit a spell, pick a little music, and sip on some of our ‘shine. Because around here, once you walk through the door, you’re family. - The Maw’s Mountain Moonshine Family Button Button Button Button 352 N.
