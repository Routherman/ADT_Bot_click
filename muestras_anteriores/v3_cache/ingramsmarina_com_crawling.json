With an eye toward customer service and convenience, we have assembled a team of operations professionals whose sole goal is operational excellence. Morningstar got its start in the self-storage business in 1981, when our in-house construction and development team began building premier storage facilities in the region, establishing a legacy of experience, excellence and longevity under the Morningstar Storage brand. In 2004, we introduced a Marina Division to expand our breadth and to leverage our operating expertise in niche real estate markets. Since that time, we have continued to grow and expand with marina facilities located in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Today, Morningstar owns and operates several full-service marinas in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast in addition to about 100 self-storage facilities. Morningstar Cares At Morningstar Marinas, our managers and staff members are local to the communities where they work. As an active business, we think it’s important to play an active role in supporting and strengthening the communities we call home through our Morningstar Cares program. Throughout the year our marinas host tournaments and events to raise funds for local non-profits. Organizations we’ve supported over the years include local Boys & Girls Clubs, the Dragon Boat cancer survivors and Captain Don Dingman’s Hook the Future Kids Foundation. Company Information Morningstar Marinas is owned and operated by Morningstar Properties , LLC., a vertically integrated developer, operator and owner of real estate products, focused primarily on marinas and self-storage. Since 1981,the company has acquired, developed and operated more than 150 self-storage projects across the country, totaling more than 10 million square feet.

Check out some of what the area has to offer below! LAKE TALQUIN STATE PARK “Visitors will find outstanding freshwater fishing with common species such as largemouth bass, striped bass, speckled perch, bream and catfish being caught off the park's boardwalk or dock. Bring your canoe or kayak to launch and explore the roughly 10,000 acre Lake Talquin. Enjoy a leisurely walk on the interpretive trail past ravine systems to a bluff overlooking Lake Talquin. The park is an excellent place for wildlife viewing and bird watching. Wildlife roaming the park includes deer, squirrel, turkey and the occasional bear. Birders are likely to spot bald eagles and osprey soaring high above the lake. The park features a picnic area with tables and grills along with a pavilion that is perfect for family reunions, private parties and weddings.” Find Out More > LAKE TALQUIN NATURE TRAIL “A vast reservoir along the Ochlockonee River behind the Jackson Bluff Dam, which feeds a hydroelectric plant helping to power Tallahassee, Lake Talquin is a rarity in Florida due to its sheer size and character. From the picnic pavilion atop the park’s main ridge, the water shimmers in the distance, and a clamber down to the boardwalk makes you feel like you’ve descended into the heart of the Adirondacks, with hilly forested ridges across the water in every direction. The interpretive trail at Lake Talquin State Park is a tease, leading you up to the edge of ravines but never plunging in, and scooting out near the edge – but not to the edge – of the bluffs that stand well above the lake. With a mostly open understory, strategically placed benches, and gentle terrain changes – despite the geological forces at work all around – the 1.1 mile footpath is an easy walk for visitors of all ages.” FIND OUT MORE > BEAR CREEK EDUCATIONAL FOREST “A wealth of wildlife, birds and wildflowers await visitors to Bear Creek Educational Forest just west of Tallahassee in Quincy. Located within the Lake Talquin State Forest, Bear Creek focuses on education, with an array of learning experiences for visitors. This 492-acre tract of the forest meanders through many natural communities including wetlands, sandhills and dramatic steephead ravines. Along with a variety of birds and wildlife, an abundance of tree species are found in the forest. There are three trails marked with orange (3 miles), blue (2 miles), and green (3/4 mile ADA trail) blazes. Parts of the forest are audio enhanced along the trail where the trees tell their own stories.” FIND OUT MORE > JOE BUDD YOUTH CONSERVATION CENTER “Joe Budd Youth Conservation Center (JBYCC) is located just outside Tallahassee, in the Joe Budd Wildlife Management Area.

A 3.75-mile, round-trip, self-guided trail takes you through an enchanting area that local legend claims is the original Garden of Eden. Beginning in longleaf pine/wiregrass uplands, the trail soon skirts the top of a dramatic steephead, descends the slope forest to cross a steephead stream, climbs up through sandhills, and eventually opens to a spectacular view from a bluff 135 feet above the Apalachicola River.” FIND OUT MORE > APALACHICOLA RIVERKEEPER Eco-Educational Outings “Explore your river and basin with us!

Founded in 1825, it is centered by a park-like square and magnificent courthouse, surrounded by historic commercial buildings—one of the few remaining preserved courthouse squares in Florida. A thriving arts community anchored by the Gadsden Arts Center and Museum, the Quincy Music Theater, Dean Mitchell’s Marie Brooks Gallery, and Legacy School of Performing Arts, along with numerous historic churches, makes it the center of civic and social life of the entire community. The nine-block downtown business district surrounded by a thirty-six block National Register Historic District was shaped by two major influences: shade-grown, cigar wrapper tobacco and the Coca-Cola Company. The adjacent residential community is a mix of magnificent antebellum and Victorian mansions and charming Southern cottages nestled amongst moss-draped oak and magnolia trees. With the availability of second floor vacancies and potential for conversion to office or residential, Quincy can become what many Americans, young and old alike, want today—to live urban in an attractive, truly walk-able community.” FIND OUT MORE > CHATTAHOOCHEE MAIN STREET “High on a hill above the east bank where the Apalachicola River begins its winding journey to the Gulf of Mexico, is the charming city of Chattahoochee, Florida. Thousands of years ago its strategic location on high ground at the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers established it as an important Native American trade center. As Florida’s river gateway to the Gulf of Mexico, its rich and colorful history spans centuries and includes the location of a major ceremonial mound complex, a river crossing on the original Old Spanish Trail, a late 1700s observatory and weather station, a British outpost, a Federal arsenal, connection to a major railroad junction, a Confederate training facility, a Freedman’s Bureau, Florida’s first penitentiary and first hospital for the mentally ill.” FIND OUT MORE > HAVANA, FLORIDA “Havana is one of Florida’s friendliest towns! Founded in 1906, historic Havana is one of Florida’s most unique villages. First settled in the earliest years of Florida’s development, it soon was driven by shade tobacco’s economic engine. The town was named after Havana, Cuba, for its renown as a high-quality tobacco growing and cigar making center. Although the town suffered a devastating fire in 1916, it rose from the ashes. Today, Havana is well known for furniture, boutiques, the arts, and of course cafes. Whatever you are looking for—antiques, vintage goods, new furniture or unique gifts—you are sure to find it here. It truly has something for everyone. Havana is the perfect location for a day trip. Located on US 27, just 12 miles north of I-10 and 6 miles south of Georgia. The town is wide open Wednesday through Sunday, with some shops open Monday and Tuesday as well. Havana is also proud to host numerous festivals and events throughout the year.” FIND OUT MORE > SHADE TOBACCO MUSEUM “Havana was once known as the shade tobacco capital of the world. The product that helped shape the town is now featured in a museum at Planter’s Exchange. Located about 20 miles northwest of Tallahassee on the Old Spanish Trail, Havana was incorporated in 1906. Shade tobacco was grown to produce fine cigars and was once one of the country's most impressive agricultural enterprises, according to the Havana History & Heritage Society. The Shade Tobacco Museum feature artwork, tools, and crafts from the area's history of tobacco farming – from seed to cigar. The Museum will also feature barn art, prints and notecards from area artists and craftsmen displayed and for sale.
