Each Beef Board member is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture from nominations submitted by certified nominating organizations. The nominating organizations represent beef and dairy producers in each state or region. Forty-two states have individual members serving on the Board. The remainder of states are divided into three regions. Importer appointments are drawn from nominations by importer associations. The number of Board members is established according to the number of cattle in the state or region, 500,000 head for the first Board member and 1,000,000 head for each additional member. Importer numbers are established in the same manner. As for CBB, all of our meetings are open to all producers and to become a member of the board you should work with a certified nominating organization in your state or region. The Beef Board has as part of its responsibility, the certification of Qualified State Beef Councils (QSBCs), of which there currently are 44, and the implementation of the provisions of the Federal Order (7 CFR Part 1260, July 18, 1986). The Beef Board oversees collection of $1-per-head on all cattle sold in the U.S. and $1-per-head equivalent on imported cattle, beef and beef products. The QSBC may retain up to 50 cents of the money collected in their state but at least 50 cents must be sent to the Beef Board. The entire $1 is remitted to the Beef Board from assessments in non-QSBC states and from importers. The Beef Board is responsible for approving the annual budget for its national checkoff-funded programs. The Beef Promotion Operating Committee consists of 20 members and is responsible for approving projects and funding to carry out programs. Ten members of the Operating Committee are elected by the Beef Board, and 10 members represent the QSBCs. The Beef Board has an Executive Committee consisting of 12 members. The committee conducts the month-to-month activities between meetings of the full Board and oversees the administration of the Beef Promotion and Research Act under the direction and within the guidelines established by Board members. The Board has established an office staff to conduct the day-to-day operations of the Board. This office also provides staff support for the Beef Promotion Operating Committee.
