      "text": "A second Horse & Hounds News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals NEWS A second Horse & Hounds EXTRA HELPINGS with RICK ALLEN If we on the east side are really good and eat all our veggies, Santa may have an early surprise for us this holiday season: a brand-new Horse & Hounds Restaurant and Pub on our side of town! Actually the right jolly old elf has nothing to do with it, except as a way to get into this. But Wendell Landry certainly does. The owner of the existing Horse & Hounds out U.S. 27 near the Golden Ocala development is determined to build a new eatery across town. And later maybe others farther afield, say in Orlando and Tampa. \"Our target is to open by November . . . over in Silver Springs,\" Landry says. \"It's very ambitious, but that's our target.\" Still, he declines to pinpoint an exact location because not all the papers have been finalized; he expects they will be in a fortnight. A number of advantages from a second Horse & Hounds immediately spring to mind. First, finally a long-recognized top-notch restaurant is planting roots east of 36th Avenue, and where one goes others tend to follow. Rumors are rampant right now about new restaurants looking at the Silver Springs area, but no one has been willing to publicly commit. Only Chili's says a new unit is coming to Ocala, but the chain hasn't yet said where. Another advantage for we dinners is the existing Horse & Hounds long ago was adopted by the equine industry out in the northwest corner of Marion County. And when HITS is in town, like right now, a reservation is generally the only ticket in on many nights, particularly on weekends. While the meals are worth every mile, who wants to drive nearly 20 miles one way if you can't get in? If you can't get to it, what does it matter how good the food is! Another Horse & Hounds in town can help ease that pressure. From the restaurant's point of view, a brand-new facility means a brand-new kitchen — one that's all in one place, and not like the split kitchen in what'll probably become the original house. Plus it'll be his house. Landry acquired the Horse & Hounds from the original owners, the Roses, a couple of years back. To run it, he brought in Austrian restaurateur Johannes Slacik, a 2004 recipient of the prestigious Chaine des Rotisseurs culinary fellowship that dates back to 1248. Slacik returned to Austria several months ago, though his honors still decorate a Horse & Hounds wall. Landry says after Slacik left, he wondered if he wanted to continue the restaurant. A fortunate series of events convinced him to go forward, and to even think bigger about expansion. His daughter, Kerrie Landry-Sanchez, is general manager. The new unit is likely to feel more like an English pub, in the traditional European sense, even more than the cozy gentlemen's hunt club ambiance of the current house. \"I don't want to be a bar, but more of a public house that's family oriented,\" Landry says. He's planning a trip to England in a few months to secure some actual pub pieces for the decor. The menu is likely to include several selections of healthier fare and smaller portions than are preferred by the hard-driving equine ranchers on the northwest side. \"We're excited,\" Landry adds. \"I don't think we'll be an Outback, but there's a niche for a Horse & Hounds.\" BURN MOR PE'NUT O'L: Maybe you've noticed the Chick-fil-A car tooling about Ocala's roads. Well, it's not the peanut oil-burning vehicle unveiled to chain franchise owners recently in Orlando. \"It's mine,\" admits Jess Burton, marketing director for the Chick-fil-A on College Road. And it runs on regular gas. Meanwhile, the truck debuted in Orlando just might be the chain's new long-term project. And while it might be addicted to oil, it's not the kind from the Middle East, or even the Alaskan wilderness. Instead, it's the oil the chain uses to cook chicken and waffle fries, from peanuts — like the tasty tubers grown on some 8,000 acres right here in Marion County, says Extension Agent David Holmes, though he adds their higher value is in roasting or boiling like they are right now. Still, Burton says, \"we use a lot of the oil in our store.\" The oil is changed out in the store about every third day. However, it's trucked away for disposal. According to a report in the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the chain is looking into the cooking oil-burning technology for cars. Evidently, something called a \"Greasecar\" fuel conversion system works with diesel engines. According to the Chronicle report, the chain usually gives away the oil for free; it can amount to nearly 4 million gallons of oil per year. For now, a Chick-fil-A spokesman is quoted as saying, \"the company is simply examining the technology and 'offering information on alternative fuel sources' to any interested franchisees.\" The report further quotes Michael Garjian, a principal in Greasecar Vegetable Fuel Systems, as saying the 2,500-mile round-trip from Massassachusetts to Florida burns 220 gallons of peanut oil and only 8 gallons of diesel, \"saving $600 in fuel costs and preventing 4,900 pounds of global-warming gases from entering the atmosphere.\" And I would bet it probably smells a lot better than diesel emissions, too! __________ Rick Allen can be reached at rick.allen@starbanner.com or 867-4122.
