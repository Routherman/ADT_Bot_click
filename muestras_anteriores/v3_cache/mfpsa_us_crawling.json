What We Do The Warehouse exists to promote, educate and inspire sustainability and positive environmental change. It is part of the Climate Emergency Centres Network. How We Do It Providing a centre for activism: meeting, office, retail and public display space to the local community and to organisations that share our aims and values. What We Aim To Do Create a carbon neutral and zero waste building that is accessible to everybody in Birmingham. Welcome to the Warehouse! The Warehouse is Birmingham Friends of the Earth’s environmental community building which is a space for activism and a home to our campaigns activity, meeting space, the vegan Warehouse Cafe, Voce Books and Sprocket Cycles. We also have office spaces which are used by organisations that share our values. A recent refurbishment has transformed and increased our space, made it much more accessible and helped us save energy. We want it to continue and grow as a place where people can meet to make environmental and social change happen. Recently we have joined the Climate Emergency Centres network, and are working to improve our role as a home for all Birmingham’s diverse communities of green activist to work together, be inspired and strengthened. If you’re interested in booking a venue, check out our spaces for hire here . A little history… Decades of activism have made it what it is today – Friends of the Earth (Birmingham) Limited, a cooperative, first moved into the Warehouse in 1977. Friends of The Earth local groups in the late 70s were often involved in practical projects that were innovative at the time – insulation and recycling projects, wholefood retailing, and the Warehouse was originally an incubator for such enterprises, many of which still exist today. We recently completed this heritage project – where you can read more about our history. … and now We’d identified the need to use our space better, increase our energy efficiency and make our building more accessible – in particular, moving the cafe downstairs and creating lift access to the top floor. In 2016 we ran a community share offer and raised £240,000 to make this plan a reality. Social enterprise The Jericho Foundation were contracted to deliver this. It was a challenging time, but we are really proud of what we achieved together – the end result is a spectacular transformation. Our values within the building In light of our environmental campaigning, we ask our community of organisations and volunteers to follow the building’s environmental policies for example in recycling, energy use, purchasing, minimising waste, and sustainable travel. We also encourage all our community including our own staff and volunteers to support the other enterprises and organisations in the building and to share resources with each other to avoid waste. While the refurbishment has achieved a lot we still have some way to go to increase our energy, water and resource-efficiency and as we emerge from the building project we are transferring our efforts into this. Birmingham Friends of the Earth is registered as a Community Benefit Society – a type of cooperative – under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. The Warehouse is run with the aim of being affordable to organisations that share our values but providing enough revenue to cover our basic costs. The rest of our funding comes from supporters and from fundraising activities including providing services at music festivals. Still want to know more? Here is more history of The Warehouse… Birmingham Friends of the Earth started in 1972 . We wanted not just to campaign, but to demonstrate practical solutions to environmental problems in the local community. We moved into the Warehouse on Allison St, Digbeth on 1st April, 1977. It was cold, damp and full of rotting lentils – but it was affordable and had plenty of space, so we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. At first, we just wanted the building for recycling purposes, but then we realised the possibilities . In October 1979 a charitable arm was established – The Birmingham Environmental Educational Project, aka BEEP . We bought The Warehouse with a grant from West Midlands County Council and help from supporters. Co-operative Working As well as the desire to demonstrate good environmental practise, we also had a strong belief in co-operative working. Newsletters sent out throughout the 70s and 80s documented the continued commitment of volunteers and workers – everyone mucked in with the cooking, cleaning and building. We learnt on the job and grew our knowledge in a range of skills – not many workplaces offered that variety of experience… …and we still do! The need to maintain and improve The Warehouse is on-going, and we have so much to offer – get in touch to volunteer with The Warehouse . Campaigns Campaigning is of course at the heart of what BFoE does. Energy, pollution, wildlife, transport, recycling and food have always been the focus of our efforts. Energy Energy was one of the earliest campaigns that BFoE got involved in – the anti-nuclear campaign in Birmingham was led by Birmingham Anti-Nuclear Group (BANG) . Pollution BFoE played a leading part in the campaign to remove lead from petrol and later worked with the Campaign for Lead Free Air (CLEAR) . Wildlife The wildlife campaigns initially concentrated efforts on changing international legislation on the big issues of the day. For the cause of Whales and Endangered Species we built a 12ft model of a sperm whale and paraded it through the streets of London! Since then the decision was made to focus on local issues , working with local groups and communities on protecting urban wildlife. This led to the eventual formation of the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust . Some of our campaign asks are enormous – like save the oceans – we will never win in our lifetime, and don’t expect to. But we have had more specific successes. We’ve been successful in defending small pockets from land developers, such as Moseley Bog. From the mid-80s Acid Rain was the main focus, with joint activities with European Youth Forest Action. There was also activity to ban Pesticides – many of which are now banned! Transport We wanted to demonstrate there were cyclists in Birmingham so we started mass participation events – 1000 people turned up to the first one. From 1979 Pushbikes was meeting with Birmingham City Council and persuaded them to produce pothole cards. By 1981 they were campaigning for the use of some pedestrian underpasses by cyclists, better cycle racks and cycle lanes on roads – from 1984 we saw the first signed backstreet bike route in Birmingham from Moseley to the city centre. By the mid-eighties, we saw campaigns by BFoE against the deregulation of the buses and the M6 Toll Road. Recycling Awareness was raised through the sale of recycled paper products, and campaigning for bottle banks and commenting extensively on the City Council’s draft Waste Disposal Plan in 1981. Food BFoE was into nutrition before it was cool – campaigning for reducing sugar intake, using wholewheat flour and wholefoods. We ran the Wholefood School of Nutrition for a few years and raised funds by catering at events. In the 80s we ran campaigns banning battery farms and promoting free-range eggs. Projects Leading by example by demonstrating solutions through practical action has always been a key part of the BFoE ethos. Some of the activities we’ve ran have evolved directly into separate companies! Over the years we’ve led on insulation and recycling projects in particular. Home Insulation Project was a major part of BFoE’s work in the 70s and 80s, and insulated 500 homes a year during that time. We carried out insulation and draught-proofing work, and gave energy advice, prioritising old and vulnerable people. BFoE led the way in the collection of goods for recycling – first collecting paper, cans and foil by van, and later furniture and carpets. At our height (1985-6), the recycling collections covered about 40,000 households and 21 areas of Birmingham! Soon after that Birmingham Council started doing door-to-door collections. Various schemes have been taken on to improve green spaces around the City. There has been a particular emphasis on growing good and creating tree nurseries. In 1980, a larger project Greensite was set up to work on improving green spaces in the community. For example, Monyhull hospital was a large mental health facility in Kings Norton that was becoming increasingly detached from the natural environment, so BFoE linked up with the residents and staff to create a pond, chicken and rabbit run in 1983. Education & Publication Education has always been a key part of BFoE’s activities to expose workers and the community to BFoE’s ideas. Over the years, we’ve:< Published cookbooks, information sheets, directories and guides Hosted exhibitions, evening classes and talks to schools & societies Toured The Insulation Roadshow with the Birmingham Environmental Educational Project (BEEP) Bus Created videos on insulation and pollution The Journey So Far… BFoE has grown into a highly regarded organisation in Birmingham while still maintaining our cooperative ethos. We have regular dialogues with councillors, businesses and city leaders. We’ve survived two major fires, financial crisis and endless roof leaks. We’ve always found a way through and continues to do so. Todays BFoE workers and volunteers are working hard for a better future for our local community and planet Earth. We’re grateful for any help you can offer. Join us for one of our meetings, or contact us directly to discuss what you could do to help.

No, our Customer Service agents cannot place an order on your behalf. If you require assistance, please call us toll free and one of our agents will direct you through the process of how to place an order online. I usually have my order shipped to my local Warehouse One store. What do I do if my store is temporarily closed? If your store is available for pick up of online orders, it will be available in the drop down menu after selecting Ship to Store during checkout. When your order is ready for pick up, you will receive an email. If your local store is temporarily closed, it is not available for ship to store orders. If you have a ship to store order at a store that is temporarily closed, you will be contacted to arrange for safe pick up. For more information please send an email to customerservice@warehouseone.com and we'll have a team member contact you as soon as possible. What does B1G1 or BOGO mean? B1G1 or BOGO means “Buy One, Get One”. You must buy two eligible items of equal or lesser value in order to receive this discount. e.g., “B1G1 50% Off” means you will get 50% off a second item of equal or lesser value. The discount is applied automatically when eligible items are added to your shopping cart. Do the prices of items marked “Plus XX% Off” already include the discount? The discount for these items is not included in the displayed price. You will see the discounted final price for these items upon adding them to your cart. Can I make changes to my order after it has been placed? Once your order has been submitted, it cannot be modified. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Can I purchase gift cards online? Yes. Gift cards purchased online without any accompanying merchandise can be shipped for a flat rate fee of $5 when sent via ground service.

You can check your gift card balance in the following ways: Online at warehouseone.com At your nearest Warehouse One store location Email at customerservice@warehouseone.com - please make sure to include all the numbers on the back of your card in the email. Can I get a gift receipt when placing an order online? Gift receipts are currently available for in store purchases and not available online.

Unworn items with their merchandise tags intact can be exchanged or returned at any Warehouse One location when presented along with the corresponding invoice. Shipping charges will not be refunded. Online purchases made with PayPal cannot be refunded back to your PayPal account in store.

Instead, Visa Debit and PayPal returns will be processed in store as either a product exchange or store credit. Please see our Return Policy page for complete details, including our extended return policy. Refunds with a gift receipt will be available for exchange or gift card in store only.

If I received a Perks Plus Pass with my purchase, but now I want to return a portion/all of my purchase, do I also have to return the Perks Plus Pass I received?

Our Artistic Vision The Warehouse Theatre is committed to creating high-quality professional work that is vital, diverse, and adventurous. We aim to inspire and challenge our audiences and artists alike through cutting-edge productions that are not available anywhere else in the Upstate. We provide a space to grow, experiment, and engage for everyone. The Warehouse expands the reach of what is theatrically possible in Greenville. Equality Statement Our vision for theatre and the world at large is one that promotes voices that repeatedly find themselves ignored. Today and everyday we stand with our Black artists, patrons, and community. We understand that systemic racism and bias continue to taint our society. We will continue to educate ourselves while working for true equality for all. Black lives matter. Our History Helping Greenville’s Art Scene Thrive For More Than 50 Years // Dr. Peter Smith, a Furman University professor, and Jim Boivin, the director of the Arts Council, led a small group from Furman to develop a summer theatre workshop for kids. Afterwards, the pair planned a summer theatre program that would produce plays in the city of Greenville. Les Timms, the manager of the Greenville Memorial Auditorium, allowed them to convert an annex to the auditorium into a black box theatre and use it rent-free for the summer. 1973 // 1974 // With the help of BJ Koonce, Smith and Boivin advertised a general meeting to gauge community interest. On an early March Sunday afternoon, they sat and waited in their warehouse space and were pleasantly surprised by the tremendous turnout. Local artists were thrilled by the idea of an alternative opportunity to work on both classical and contemporary texts. The new theatre was off and running under the slogan From the Classics to the Contemporary. That same summer, a Board of Directors was created, Timms agreed to let the theatre stay in the space for a modest fee, and the theatre received a grant from the South Carolina Arts Commission to help pay the new Artistic Director, Peter Smith. The Warehouse Theatre was officially born and Greenville quickly took to this alternative, less commercial, more intimate form of theatre. Long tenured Artistic Director Jack Young arrived at Warehouse Theatre. With his arrival came the Journeymen acting program. This professional but instructional program took young actors, provided additional training and skill sets vital to a successful career, and employed them on the main stage for a full season. The Journeymen became a solid footing for future educational programs of the theatre, which now comprise 50% of the organization’s overall mission. 1993 // 1995 // The Warehouse formed its Upstate Shakespeare Festival , which produces two plays in partnership with the City of Greenville. These are performed in Falls Park on the Reedy each summer from May until August under the 25-year leadership of USF Producing Director, John Fagan. The festival has produced over 60 plays since its inception with most coming directly from the Shakespearean canon. The shows are always free and open to the public. The theatre acquired a new home with a move to an award-winning renovation of a former cotton warehouse. With the move, The Warehouse Theatre became the cornerstone of Greenville’s historic West End, the city’s thriving arts and entertainment district. 1998 // Today // As Greenville’s only fully professional producing theatre, The Warehouse Theatre currently produces a six to seven show Main Stage Season , manages a regional Educational Program consisting of an annual Educational Tour, This Wooden O (Language Arts Program) , Applied Theatre Program , and Community Engagement Initiatives , and produces the Upstate Shakespeare Festival in Falls Park .
