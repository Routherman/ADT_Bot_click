Retreat won numerous awards and is regarded as one of the Europe's top wellbeing destinations spas. The retreat evolved from and represents Marina's personal journey of transformation. Marina was diagnosed with cancer in her 20s. She was driven by success in the world of banking which eventually led to exhaustion. Close to the brink she started looking for much needed balance. This led her to explore and study the Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Five Elements and other alternative heath methods. She also started visiting the world's top destination spas. All this led her to recovery and she then decided she would create a place where people with similar needs could feel at home and be nurtured and guided on their own personal journey to a more holistic, socially aware and spiritually satisfying way of life. Marina retrained in various modalities of Chinese medicine and began her work in transformational healing by leading workshops and retreats before ultimately creating Euphoria Retreat I the UNESCO protected town of Mystras. Marina has personally designed and oversees some retreat at Euphoria herself. These include 'Odysseus Journey', 'The emotional & physical transformation programme', 'Meaningful relationships, and new for 2021 'Feel Alive Again' which is a group retreat designed to offer post-pandemic support, rest and recovery. Marina is warm. vivacious and fun loving and many guests report that to work with her is both insightful and inspiring.
