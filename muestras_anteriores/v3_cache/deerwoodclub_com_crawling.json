The neighborhood is naturally pleasant with ancient oaks and various landscaping lining the roadways and yards. The resident social scene and the community amenities complete the active lifestyle for those looking to know their neighbors and enjoy a community-oriented lifestyle. But, what’s it really like? If you are considering a move to Deerwood finding a home can be a not so easy task! Equally as hard is finding a family-oriented neighborhood that truly feels like home. We questioned a few residents of Deerwood to help create a picture of the community and help get a sense of what Deerwood is like from an “insider’s perspective.” Here’s what they had to say. Q: What do you LOVE about Deerwood? I love the older homes with a wide variety of styles, large plots of land with plenty of backyard space, and beautiful trees, that it’s a bit of a hidden gem right in the middle of town…most importantly, the people! Our neighborhood is going through a transition with so many young families, a lovely mix of out-of-towners and those who were born and raised here. – Kimberly A Q: What do people misunderstand most about Deerwood? There’s a bit of a misnomer that you have to move to St. John’s County for great schools. If you look at the rankings, many of Duval County schools are fantastic and the wide variety of great nearby private schools and early childcare are also not to be missed! – Kimberly A Q: Do you use the Deerwood Country Club? If so, what is most appealing to you about the club? Yes, we are members! The golf course is in great shape, with plenty of family-centric events, a kids club, and a fitness center! – Kimberly A Q: What DON’T people know about Deerwood? Deerwood was the first gated community in Jacksonville and developed by the very families that have played a significant role in developing the city. So I think if you know of Deerwood, you know it’s amazing. But many people simply don’t know about Deerwood. – Kimberly A Browse Other Florida Beach Communities We Serve Atlantic Beach Jacksonville Beach Neptune Beach Nocatee Ponte Vedra Beach South Ponte Vedra Contact The Volen Group today for help with your next home.
