April 2022.  As soon as we had the first visit from Ryan from the team, he completely stood out.  Immediately, Ryan noticed some of the features of the house that other potential realtors had missed and started piecing together a marketing strategy tailored to our specific house.  We were thrilled and convinced that this was indeed the best way to go !  What a great choice this was. We created a super bond with Ryan who made himself available at all stages and was not only highly knowledgeable but also had a very attentive approach to our questions and needs.  The whole sale process was facilitated by a top notch support team that included a very talented and pleasant home photographer, administrative, logistics, negotiations as well as right-hand people. The approach of the team can be described as absolutely first class, a perfect blend of professionalism and kindness.  Dealing with such a team took away most of the stress that such a transaction could have brought on us.  The reward from such great guidance and support was of course closing a sale at conditions above and beyond our expectations !  The targeted marketing strategy of the Tricoli team definitely was the right one and it paid off by having delighted sellers (ourselves) but also, happy buyers !

She explained the process to me thoroughly. She then gave me the opportunity to review the contract. She then gave me the time to review the contract, and I wanted to discuss it with family. She said it was no problem and to give her a call when I was ready. After that, I gave her a call, and she replied in person, which was very considerate and made me feel significantly more comfortable than the other realtors I had dealt with beforehand. She comprehensively reviewed the contract with me, and after considering everything that was explained, I signed the contact without any worries or concerns due to her comprehensive explanation of the contact at hand. She assured me that I would get a certain amount for my property and she absolutely fulfilled that guarantee. Everybody I spoke to at Tricoli Team was exceedingly friendly and helpful. Contact through the Team was constant and very easy to reply to. They had no issue in explaining anything I didn't understand, which was incredibly helpful for someone who has never went through a home selling process like this before. I have since referred Liz and her Team to other residents and friends of mine who are interested in selling their property, solely due to the professionalism and courtesy they showed me during my home selling journey. Thank you again to Tricoli Team for making this process as seamless and painless as they have.

Not knowing anyone in my Boynton Beach I was very lucky to connect with Jeff Tricoli and his team through a nationwide search engine. Of course, that search engine provided me with the names of many local agencies. I contacted them all, and they all responded, but Jeff's response was faster and far more professional. He provided me with all sorts of information included in highly professional and easily understood power point and other hi tech presentations suitable for long distance communication. I was impressed but a little skeptical of someone I had not met face-to-face.\nWhen we did meet face to face, my concerns were laid to rest. Jeff was not only as polished and professional as the presentations he had sent to me but also highly energetic and sincere. \nBeing so far from the property, I was not able to be as involved in the sale as I would have liked, but that worry also proved unfounded. Jeff and his team went right to work and kept me informed every step of the way. In fact, they found legitimate buyers so quickly that I had to scurry to remove all my parents’ belongings including treasured keepsakes from the property.\nI got the price I wanted, and everything went smoothly, quickly and hassle-free. What else could one want?\nJeff’s knowledge of the area, no nonsense approach, and mastery of technology also make him the clear choice, especially in this era of social distancing. read more Enid Atwater 2021-01-16T22:02:00+0000 I am very pleased with the Tricoli Team as my listing, sales, and closing agents.

They even got us a split closing so we could sign the papers at a day which best suited us. We even had snacks during the closing which lasted only about 30 minutes. Awesome!

We had gotten the property with ... aspirations of either building our retirement home there when the time came or rolling it over for profit.  When it became clear that we could no longer hold onto the land due to financial need we read realtor reviews and chose The Tricoli Team.  We had previously gotten unsolicited mail from “realtors” in the area of the property who were offering to purchase our land for a pittance, so we were slightly concerned that a big organization like Tricoli would not be interested in “working the deal” to get us a price more in line with what we expected.  The Tricoli Team not only got us the closing price we anticipated, but patiently answered our many questions, and closed the deal in just three weeks after listing.

Our agent, Brielle, helped us so much during the home buying process. She was extremely knowledgeable and trustworthy. As first time home buyers, having a team we could trust get us through this process was everything! Beyond our search for a home, when we finally found the one, the Tricoli team was extremely helpful in getting everything completed during our very quick closing window. We never felt unsure or unsupported in this process. Most importantly, we couldn't be happier with the home we found and the price we got it for! Our agent did great negotiating and we purchased our property at $25,000 under the appraisal value. This feels so great stepping into our first home! I couldn't recommend the Tricoli team more, to all of our family and friends, and will keep them in mind for all our future endeavors! Cole Breier 18:53 25 Aug 25 Chase and Jeff from the Tricoli team were very professional in selling our home, we had much more interest in our property because of the extensive marketing they provided.

Dave S 16:26 28 Jul 25 I am overall very happy with having the Tricoli Team Real Estate-Keller Williams Realty. I was happy with everyone on the team especially with Chase, Brielle, Virgil, and Neil. These people worked especially very hard to get me my necessary answers to my questions and to get my old house on the market fast. They were able to get my old house sold relatively within a short time so I was able to move on to find a new house quickly. There were a few mishaps along the way as far as communication was concerned but overall did an awesome job. Will definitely want to use them again for all my real estate needs. Thank you!!! Maria del Rosario Villalta 22:50 21 Jul 25 I give many thanks to Chase, Neil, and the rest of the Tricoli team for handling the sale of my condo. Their feedback on my condo and what to do prior to photographs being taken was very helpful.

The listing looked wonderful with the great pictures and informative description.The sale ended up being quick and easy, despite the setbacks from the buyers side. The Tricoli team kept me informed and answered all my questions throughout the process. I knew all of the deadlines, what to expect at each step, and what we were waiting on from the buyers side at all times. It was only two months from the listing going live to the closing of the sale. Great work from all of the team! Taylor Brewer 15:09 09 Jul 25 We had a truly excellent experience working with Ryan Garcia from The Tricoli Team on the sale of our home in Jupiter, Florida.

I feel like not all Realtors always do things in the best interests of a buyer but Josh did throughout the process. LoveYashua 04:09 30 May 25 Chase Caccamo was wonderful from start to finish. He would check in even when the probate process seemed to be at a standstill. Chase knew that it would take 9-10 months before the court would give the order to sell the house, yet he waited patiently and was supportive throughout the journey.  During this time Chase would keep InTouch, he would check in with us and would help us prepare for the pending house sale in a professional way.  He would keep us up to date on the housing market trend and he would reassure us with optimism. Also, I especially want to thank Neil who lent a listening ear, he was very supportive and encouraging when I was stressed. Neil would respond when Chase was not available. I also want to thank the  Jeff Tricoli team who were working behind the scenes to  provide a satisfactory outcome. susann koenig 00:52 25 May 25 Thank you Tricoli Team for all your help in selling our home.Ryan and Neil were great help.

Francis Barros 20:55 15 Apr 25 The team we worked with at Tricoli was not only very professional but also extremely effective in communicating honest and knowledgeable information about the market trends and property values. From Ryan Garcia to Neil and Juhn, we could not have asked for a better team. The three were consistent from the beginning when providing clarity regarding their fees, commissions, and potential challenges. They prioritized our needs and respected our requests as to give us notice a day in advance for client showings. We were provided accurate advice and guidance, so we could make more informed decisions. Until the last day, they showed us patience, empathy, and a willingness to go above & beyond. Because they created such a positive and stress free experience for us, we will most definitely use the Tricoli team again in the future. Jeanine Mathurine 21:16 14 Apr 25 Working with Chase and Neil from the Jeff Tricoli Team was hands-down the best decision we made when selling our home. From our first meeting, Chase brought a calm confidence and clear game plan that immediately put us at ease. Throughout the entire process, he was communicative, honest, and incredibly responsive—he made a very stressful process feel smooth and manageable.Neil was also a huge part of our success. As Chase’s right hand, he stepped in seamlessly when needed, always available to answer questions, follow up on details, and make sure things stayed on track. It truly felt like we had a powerhouse team in our corner, looking out for us from start to finish.Our house went under contract quickly, and thanks to their guidance, we made it to the closing table right on time.

They were responsive, knowledgable, and provided me with constant communication about the status of my property. As a first time seller, they guided me through every step of the process and provided solid advice to get my home sold quickly at a fair price. Even when my agent was unavailable, they had a support team that worked every day to get me the answers I needed. I gave feedback one time about giving me awareness ahead of time when contacts were planning to come so I could buzz them in and plan better around my meetings. They responded beautifully and made adjustments to ensure that the next time was approached differently. The support I received made for a top-notch customer experience and eased the stress of balancing a busy work/home life and selling a property. I would definitely recommend if your in search of an agent!

Chris demonstrated a deep understanding of the local market, offering valuable insights and guidance at every step. He was highly responsive, patient, and truly listened to our needs and preferences. His professionalism made the entire process seamless—from initial viewings to final negotiations. Chris went above and beyond, ensuring we were informed, comfortable, and confident in our decisions. He was proactive in scheduling showings, flexible with our timing, and provided honest feedback about each property we toured. He remained positive, encouraging, and dedicated throughout the entire experience. Thanks to his commitment and expertise, we found the perfect home that checked all our boxes. We highly recommend Chris to anyone looking for a trustworthy, dependable, and knowledgeable realtor in the Palm Beach County area. His commitment to client satisfaction is truly exceptional Bob Elliott 22:21 23 Mar 25 From start to finish the listing process was exceptional.  The current market trend was explained in detail by Ryan along with how the current evaluation was made and what the suggested listing price should be.  Not only did he give expert advice, but he also listened to our ideas and incorporated them into the listing.  Communication was excellent.  We received a weekly activity report call from Neil and were invited to ask any questions.  Ryan was always only a call or text away.  I can't express how impressed I was with the communication!  As the market shifted, Ryan was always presenting new options.  During the closing, Juhn was in constant communication, making sure all of the documents were accurate and complete.  I would highly recommend the Tricoli Team! Marsha Grant 20:14 21 Mar 25"
