A Brief History of The Alley & Owner Mark Thomas Home The Alley Chicago Blog A Brief History of The Alley & Owner Mark Thomas Picture in your mind, 1971. 1971 was a crazy year. The Vietnam War was on everyone's mind. Kids were being drafted, others were protesting. Jim Morrison was found dead in his bathtub, and The New York Dolls were starting their career in New York City. The unmistakable sounds of legendary rock bands such as Black Sabbath, AC/DC, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Kiss, and Aerosmith piped through the airwaves. The seventies was the beginning of the Me Generation, and also the Sexual Revolution. It was on a cold Thursday, December 16th to be exact, that a cocky 17 year old kid found his way into the posh Oak Trust & Savings Bank (located at Oak and Rush Street) and purchased a $1725 cashier check with money that was earmarked for his college education. He had the cashier's check made out to an Ed Johnson. This cocky kid (Mark Thomas) already had 1 failed business (which was a candle making business) 3 months earlier under his belt. He had big dreams for himself in the business world. With this cashier's check, he negotiated and purchased a jewelry casting business and this is where the story began...35 years later...it continues today. Mark started with a little business called Excalibur Products. And then it became Liberty Trading, Excaliber Studios, and Fashion Victim soon followed. He sold his wares to anyone who would buy them, sometimes even out of the trunk of his car! He believed that when one door closes, another one is always open. He never gave up. This cocky kid had huge dreams of conquering the business world, and while some of his outlandish dreams went unfulfilled, overall he has succeeded beyond everyone's expectations. Mark Thomas has spent almost 30 years at the corner of Belmont and Clark where he met his wife and raised two daughters. He is the owner of: The Alley stores, The Art Colony, The Music Factory( 100 art and music studios, 270 tenants), a jewelry factory, and a screen-printing business. He has traveled almost 4,000,000 miles in his life; allowing him the opportunity to observe other forms of government, business strategies, cultures, and approaches to community development. He is one of the founders and past president of Central Lakeview Merchants Association, Special Service Area #17, Executive Director of K.E.B.I.C, and board member of Local First Chicago. He has also spent time as a board member of Halsted Business Alliance (then NAMA), and serves as a current member of the Chicago Federal Reserve Banks Industry Leaders Reporting Group.

My daughter, Adrienne Thomas interviewed you a couple of years ago probably about the time  your store closed. Do you remember her? Rich Buddy Casanova February 21, 2023 Did Mr. Mark Thomas start The Alley at Broadway & Surf, or was that someone else? Thomas Luxton February 21, 2023 Hey Joe, got my purple jacket today.

FILE PHOTO Article content The late-summer blues have set in and it means a return to school for some, but to a few of us, this period is known as garage sale season.

Play Video Article content There are no official records kept on how many garage sales take place each year in Edmonton, but anecdotally I’m seeing fewer of them. Like so many other events and products, the internet has dismantled physical garage sales in favour of Facebook Marketplace or listings on Kijiji or Craigslist. Decades ago the boulevards would be littered with garish garage sale signs, pointing in all directions, each touting caches of riches at bargain prices. There is a skill to scoping out garage sales with potential, as passed down to me from my mother. Early Friday morning she would dig out the classified section from the daily newspaper and circle all the garage sale listings in our vicinity, mentally mapping a route for us. Before I turned 10 years old I saw every back alley north of Yellowhead Trail. Edmonton Sun Headline News Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

Article content One person’s junk is another person’s treasure … although it’s usually just junk. FILE PHOTO It was the thrill of the elusive bargain that fuelled her, in addition to the coffee and cigarettes she’d consume while driving. Mounds of dusty junk haphazardly stacked on rickety tables in someone’s grungy garage might not be your idea of paradise, but the sight of unwanted clutter tantalized my budding collector tendencies. In those days before eBay, if you wanted something that was no longer available on the racks at Zellers or Woolco you were out of luck unless you came across it being sold second-hand. Old toys from forgotten franchises, comic books worth no more than a quarter and vinyl albums people couldn’t even give away were what I sought while my mother would peruse old clothing and other household gadgets. We were not below the poverty line but our garage sale exploits could certainly inspire a Dolly Parton song . Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The appeal of garage sales extended beyond the acts of browsing and buying. There was an element of voyeurism as you rummaged through the contents of homes spilled out on a driveway. You didn’t need to know the style of furniture strangers once had in their living rooms or that a neighbour was really into macrame, but surveying those unwanted items was a small invitation into their lives. Conversations would strike up and introductions would be made within the confines of a garage blue with cigarette smoke alongside stacks of chipped plates and puzzles with missing pieces. It was a back alley form of community-building.

Article content Online garage listings replete with photos have made bargain hunting more efficient, but at the cost of adventure. It was the thrill of digging to the bottom of water-logged cardboard boxes for the slimmest of chances of discovering a forgotten treasure; a suburban version of a mythical bazaar, if you will. Now if I want something I can search for it within the cesspool known as Facebook Marketplace, but without the thrill. Whenever I drive by a garage sale now I’ll slow down and try to spot any treasures lingering in the shadows, always tempted to jump out and search, until my kids in the back seat remind me to keep driving as we don’t need any more junk at home. chuculak@postmedia.com twitter.com/northsidechad Article content Share this article in your social network Share this Story : HUCULAK: Back-alley treasure hunting: the ongoing allure of garage sales Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Comments You must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.

What We Do We provide a private money management experience. Recognizing that each of our clients is unique, Alley Company customizes investment solutions for client specific goals and objectives. To learn more about our customized investment solutions, please click on the categories below. Alley Company Dividend Portfolio The Alley Company Dividend Portfolio seeks to achieve a balance between attractive absolute dividend yield and strong dividend growth underpinned by quality company fundamentals. Our goal is to produce an attractive and rising income stream along with capital appreciation. We seek out companies with proven track records of dividend payout as well as strong balance sheets and durable competitive advantages in their businesses. Alley Company Core Portfolio The Alley Company Core Portfolio seeks to compound long-term rates of return by investing in high-quality growth companies. We build portfolios of leadership companies with proven track records and strong potential for sustainable future growth in revenue, earnings, and free cash flow. Attractive dividends are an important part of the portfolio, but we will also invest in companies that choose to reinvest cash flow into growth opportunities, acquisitions, or share repurchase activity. Asset-Allocation Programs In building and managing asset-allocation programs, we focus on risk-adjusted returns. Through asset allocation, we seek to increase overall return for a given degree of risk, or to reduce overall risk for a targeted level of return, depending on a client’s needs. For asset allocation to produce successful risk-adjusted returns over any meaningful time frame, the right asset classes with the right properties must be blended together in the right proportions. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Alley Company utilizes ETFs to complement our proprietary products and to build out our asset-allocation programs. We engage in extensive analysis to determine which ETFs are appropriate for our investors. We focus on low-cost, liquid, and tax-efficient ETFs that help us gain exposure to important asset classes such as small and mid-cap U.S. equities, international equities, and fixed-income. Other Customized Solutions Other customized investment solutions offered by Alley Company include careful management of concentrated stock positions and strategies for achieving a targeted level of portfolio income. Our expertise in the options market can facilitate the disposition/diversification of a concentrated stock position and can enhance portfolio income. We also provide advice on any number of capital markets or financial-related matters specific to a client.

Alley Repertory Theater’s productions tackle a range of themes for people and cultures from all walks of life. From contemporary, timely, Pulitzer Prize-winning plays to well-known musicals and wild Christmas Extravaganzas, Alley Rep strives to be a company that produces quality, innovative theater. Our Mission We connect diverse artists, audiences, and our community through bold, risk-taking theater. As a cultural leader we strive to advance compassion, inclusion, and joy. Our Vision We are a trail blazing, artistic home where emerging and established artists connect with engaged and curious audiences. Alley envisions a world where all joyfully celebrate and welcome diversity, equity, and inclusion in the theater. Our Home Visual Arts Collective (VAC), is a contemporary ﬁne art gallery, performance venue and cultural center in Garden City, Idaho, committed to presenting exhibitions and events for artists working in visual and performance art, ﬁlm, music, dance and theater. VAC is dedicated to providing Boise and the Treasure Valley opportunities to explore various disciplines, to engage in interactive art, to participate in special events and to encourage artists and the community to continue in the discovery of artistic expression. VAC and Alley Rep are part of The Alley Arts and Cultural District, whose mission it is to renovate this riverfront neighborhood into a Live-Work-Create destination. Founded in 2008, Alley Rep has grown into a theater of, and for, our community. This season we are asking for growth from our audiences, our play choices, and ourselves. Alley Rep is committed to working intentionally and rigorously to break down barriers to creating and making inclusive theater—including those based on race, gender, sexuality, ability, and economics. Our Team Buffie Main Artistic Director Email Buffie Main has been directing theater for nearly three decades and is known for bold, risk-taking theater that sparks conversation and creates community. Buffie believes that giving artists the space to be themselves and find joy is the pixie dust for creating meaningful theater. Buffie’s favorite directing credits include Indecent, The Cake, Rapture Blister Burn, In the Next Room OR the Vibrator Play, Love Person, and La Cage Aux Folles. Buffie is a member of the Lincoln Center Directors Lab in New York City, and Toronto, an elite group of international professional directors and scholars who study and create collaboratively worldwide. Buffie also holds a BFA in Theater from Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, and an MPA from the University of South Dakota. In 2020, Buffie was awarded the Alexa Rose Fellowship. Alexa Rose Fellows are nominated by their peers and are merit-based awards of $25,000 that provide resources for the accelerated development of an artist’s creative practice. Buffie’s joy is creating spaces where actors can be courageous, the work is fearless, and a play creates connection. Kenna Brackhahn Patron Services Manager Email Kenna has been working with Alley Repertory Theater since 2008, first serving on the Board of Directors and then moving into her current position as the Patron Services/Operations Manager. Kenna fell in love with theater in 4th grade after watching The King and I. Since then, she has been actively involved in theater in some form or another for most of her life. In the 13 years she has been volunteering with Alley Repertory Theater, Kenna has witnessed the magic of theater (both on stage and off) and thoroughly enjoys experiencing every “wow” moment with each production. She is delighted to continue her work with Alley Rep and is excited to see what the future holds for this organization. Kenna shares this crazy journey called life with her husband, Ty and two dogs, Bogey and Birdie. Jason Haskins Resident Dramaturge/Social Media Manager Email Jason is a playwright, screenwriter, novelist, and sports writer that has been with Alley in various capacities since 2011.

John Wicks DEI Program Manager Email Hailing from the College of Idaho, where he studied acting and performed in plays such as Baby with the Bathwater, Lie of the Mind, The Winters’ Tale, Smash, and The Water Engine, he also worked in stage management, electrician, and set construction. he found Alley Rep during Indecent and helped backstage as a stagehand. He came to love the VAC and the people it held. After performing in Bernhardt/Hamlet he helped close out A Funny Thing Happened…much earlier than anyone anticipated due to the virus. During the hiatus from theatre he’s worked with Alley to create a more diverse, equal, and inclusive environment, platform, and dialogue. He’s excited to share this larger, more loving space with some of you as audience members and collaborators and hopes that we all rise to the very challenging task of introspection, listening, discussion, and personal growth. A jack of many trades, a master of none: Writer, BLM activist, Actor, and Director. Wendy Fox Designer Email With a deep, lifelong love of theater – Wendy has been active with Alley Rep since 2014, designing costumes, sound, and experiences to best support the moment.
