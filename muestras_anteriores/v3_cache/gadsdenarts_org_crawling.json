Planned giving is a way of making a valuable contribution to the museum. By including Gadsden Arts in your estate planning, your gift has a long-lasting impact on the museum and the community we serve. The Gadsden Arts Legacy Society honors individuals who have made a commitment to the future of Gadsden Arts by including the museum in their estate plans.

Fiore Leigh Watson Healy and John Healy Jane and Alex Hinson Luis Maza** Patricia Yancey Martin Jim Miller Neil Mooney Dana Preu** Meredith and Robert DeWitt Smith Margaret and Randolph Thrower* Grace Robinson Katee Tully Marjorie Turnbull Watson Arts Fund Elaine Tully Woodward** and Bob Woodward** Julia Munroe Woodward** Katherine Woodward Jenny and Mayo Woodward ** Deceased Gadsden Arts Endowment Trust Value as of January, 2024 $1.2M / Goal $2M Gadsden Arts is a vitally important community resource – enriching life for everyone and contributing to the cultural and economic vitality of our community. You can help sustain Gadsden Arts in perpetuity through the Gadsden Arts Endowment Trust. The Trust supports Gadsden Arts programs and facility needs. Principal is permanently restricted to ensure longevity, and a conservative 2.5% spending rate promotes fund growth over time. Contributions of any amount may be made to the endowment, with cumulative giving of $50,000+ recognized through a fund named for you, your family, or a loved one. A fund of $100,000 can designate support for a specific area of programming. Contact Grace Robinson to explore your possible investment in endowment, (850) 627-5020. Gadsden Arts Endowment Trust Named Funds Margaret and Randolph Thrower Fund for Collections Julia Munroe Woodward Endowment Fund Elaine and Bob Woodward Endowment Fund Mary Jane and Pat Woodward Endowment Fund Planned Giving Options Bequests A bequest is a provision in one’s last will and testament directing a transfer from your estate to a charitable organization. It is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to support the charities you care about for generations to come. Sample language for a direct bequest: I give $_____________ (or X% of my estate) to the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum, a nonprofit corporation as described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, located at 13 North Madison Street, Quincy, FL 32351, to be used for its tax-exempt purposes. You can create a wonderful legacy next time you update your will. Publicly Traded Stock Shares of appreciated publicly traded securities are an effective way to support Gadsden Arts and avoid taxation on the gain. We can receive stock gifts directly through your brokerage account; you receive a charitable income tax deduction, usually equivalent to fair market value calculated as the average of the high and low stock price on the day the stock is received by Gadsden Arts. We will sell the stock immediately and apply the net proceeds toward our mission. To transfer stock to Gadsden Arts, call (850) 627-5020 for our DTC and broker information. Life Insurance Life insurance is a simple way to make a significant gift. Donors designate Gadsden Arts as the owner and beneficiary of the policy using, for example, an existing paid-up life insurance policy, an existing policy on which you are still making payments, or a new policy that you purchase. Retirement Accounts Naming Gadsden Arts as a primary or contingent beneficiary on a retirement account is an easy way to make a planned gift to the museum. A simple beneficiary designation form or online designation is usually all it takes to include the museum in your estate plans. Artwork Potential donations of art require special advance planning. Please contact Ashley Williams, Curator, for more information about the museum’s Collection Policy.

Her work blended art and social consciousness and confronted injustices against African Americans. Catlett became one of the first three students to receive an MFA at the University of Iowa in 1940, and the first African American woman. She is best known for her sculptures and prints created during the 1960s and 70s. This collection comes from scholar Samella Lewis, who lived and worked in Tallahassee early in her career. Lewis and Catlett were lifelong friends, and Lewis went on to write African American Art History to recapture artists and work that had been marginalized by art historians of the time. Both women pioneered professional opportunities for Black female artists in the visual arts. This collection features 30 works by Elizabeth Catlett including lithographs, mixed media, woodcuts, bronze, and wood sculptures; a few works by her husband, Francisco Mora; and works by Lewis herself. This exhibition was organized by Landau Traveling Exhibitions, Los Angeles, CA. Field Trips Be sure to check out our Elizabeth Catlett-themed Field Trips for all ages, ArtZone activities, and Art @ Home Kits during the exhibition, offering art-filled fun for all ages! Contact Museum Educator, Sarah Black-Sadler at (850) 627-5023 or sarah.blacksadler@gadsdenarts.org to schedule a tour. Art Talk Live! Thursday, April 6, 2023, 5:30 pm—6:30 pm on Zoom (FREE) Join staff from the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) and the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum (GACM) to explore connections between GACM’s exhibition The Art of Elizabeth Catlett: From the Collection of Samella Lewis and NMWA’s collection. This exhibition comes from the collection of Dr. Samella Lewis (1924-2022), a student of Catlett and an accomplished artist, professor, and author, and features 30 works by Elizabeth; a few works by her husband, Francisco Mora; and works by Lewis herself. The conversation will extend to artists with ties to Catlett’s past and present, such as Loïs Mailou Jones, one of Catlett’s teachers at Howard University. The National Museum of Women in the Arts ( NMWA ) is the first museum in the world solely dedicated to championing women through the arts. With its collections, exhibitions, programs, and online content, the museum inspires dynamic exchanges about art and ideas. NMWA advocates for better representation of women artists and serves as a vital center for thought leadership, community engagement, and social change. NMWA addresses the gender imbalance in the presentation of art by bringing to light important women artists of the past while promoting great women artists working today. The collections highlight paintings, sculptures, photography, and video by artists including Louise Bourgeois, Mary Cassatt, Judy Chicago, Frida Kahlo, Shirin Neshat, Faith Ringgold, Pipilotti Rist, Amy Sherald, and Élisabeth Louise Vigée-LeBrun.
