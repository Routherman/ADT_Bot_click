I wanted to do the BA Hons (Top Up) in Professional Arts Practice course to further develop my skills for the industry. It is the perfect balance between academic writing and creativity. I already have seen improvements, both in my academic and performing work, and I now really value the ability to critically reflect on past experiences in order to improve my current skills.” - Sarah Collinge – Musical Theatre Performer  Current Student, Class of July 2024 “I have found that my first term at Italia Conti has been better than I could’ve imagined. I am working with driven, passionate, likeminded people within all different realms of the performing arts industry. I find that the course is very tailored to each individual and the content is broad enough to apply to everyone but specific enough to challenge each person within their abilities. I find the course to be a place where I can collaborate and interact with people who I’d never had met otherwise. I only look forward to what the next few months of the course bring and feel more motivated than ever.” - Kate Drummond – Actor Current Student, Class of July 2024 Current Student, Class of July 2024 “The course is allowing me to reflect on my past practice, current position, and future endeavours. I really enjoy how flexible the course is, with regards to being able to tailor my studies to my own practice, enabling me to maximise the benefits of this on my future career. I expect my professional development to be impacted exponentially and I am excited to continue!” - Amy-Jo Sumner – Musical Theatre Performer “Italia Conti’s BA Top up course was the one for me! Creating a business in under 9 months has been a massive accomplishment! The course really helps shape your future, enables you to meet professional contacts to support your research, and gives you lots of time to understand the area of the industry you want to specialise in.” - Rachel Ward – Performing Arts Tutor Graduate, BA Top up Class of Sept 2022 I’m a professional dancer but have taught only ballet. These classes are EXACTLY what I was looking for to show some basics of contemp for my students !! Absolutely love every single Video - @ginamusaelyan2307 – Italia Conti Virtual I’ve watched a lot of your videos and I love every single one that she teaches. THANK YOU. Gorgeous movement. - @debbied3464 – Italia Conti Virtual Amazing class, one of the best I’ve ever done.

Restaurants Bar Italia Coming to Central Florida Italian concept moving into Winter Park. Published Date: April 13, 2022, 3:29 PM EDT Written By Ross McWaters News Writer Share SHARE The Ohio-based concept is crossing state lines to open a new unit in Winter Park, according to owner Rick Doody. The concept is coming to us by way of Doody’s company, NCR Ventures. In a brief phone interview with What Now on Tuesday, Doody began with: “We are really excited to be back in Orlando.” Bar Italia will be replacing Brio Italian Grille in Winter Park at 480 Orlando Ave. For Doody, who was the former owner of the Bravo / Brio Italian Grille brand, returning to this location with a new concept is exciting. “I’ve known the landlord for over 30 years.” Doody said that his team just submitted for permits and anticipate getting them in four to six weeks. Then they will begin construction with hopes of opening the location by the end of the year. One of the main stays of the concept is house-made pastas, scratch-made wood-fired pizzas and a section of the menu in which you can choose your own noodle, sauce and protein.
