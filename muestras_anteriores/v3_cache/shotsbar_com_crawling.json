In a release on Wednesday, police said that the operation — dubbed “Operation Night Cap” — took place between July and November. “This operation involved a variety of law enforcement tactics, including undercover drug purchases at bars and nightclubs in the Downtown Entertainment Area,” the release reads. “Undercover officers went to 23 different establishments and purchased illegal narcotics such as fentanyl, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine, methamphetamine, 2C (psychedelics), and cannabis.” In all, the operation led to 85 charges against 32 total suspects, police added. So far, 11 people have been arrested. Graphic released by the Orlando Police Department showing the booking photos for the 11 suspects arrested in \"Operation Night Cap\" (Orlando Police Department) However, police also said that undercover officers witnessed around 150 “After-Midnight Sales Permit” violations across the 23 bars and nightclubs involved in the operation. As investigators explained, the city requires that these businesses implement certain safety measures, such as the use of weapons detection systems and ID scanners. But during Operation Night Cap, police said they were able to enter these bars and nightclubs with firearms “due to inadequate or non-existent wand searches.” “In most cases, IDs were not scanned or visually inspected, as mandated,” the release continues. According to investigators, the establishments involved in this operation were as follows: Establishments in violation of the AMS permit Establishments where drugs were sold 64 North Aero Rooftop Bar & Lounge Aero Rooftop Bar & Lounge Bullitt Bar ( Employee sold drugs to an undercover officer ) The Attic/Treehouse Casey’s on Central The Basement Dank Smoke Shop ( Employee sold drugs to an undercover officer ) Bullitt Bar Eden The Lounge The Beacham Fixtion Restaurant and Bar EVE Orlando The Monkey Bar Elixir Parlay Orlando Fixtion Restaurant and Bar Planet Pizza Hen House Pretty Please Hooch Room 22 ( Employee sold drugs to an undercover officer ) The Monkey Bar SHOTS Bar Orlando Parlay Orlando Sly Fox Pub Proper Swiggs ( Two employees sold drugs to undercover officers ) Room 22 Taco Kat SHOTS Bar Orlando Underground Public House Shakai Sushi Lounge Wall Street Shine Sidebar Orlando The Other Bar Tier 22 Waitkiki Wall Street Cantina Among these, 64 North, Aero Rooftop Bar & Lounge, and The Beacham have taken part in a lawsuit against the city over some of the security measures imposed on downtown businesses. Police said a hearing will be held to address the violations, and a decision will be made about whether to suspend or revoke the respective establishments’ permits. But Scott Kotroba, owner of the Bullitt Bar, denied any connection between his establishment and one of the suspects who was arrested in this operation. “(The police) kind of accuse some of our venues of something that just did not happen,” he said. “We are not aware of any violations. We have a strong communication with the city and code enforcement. We communication with them probably three-to-four times a week on what’s going on, what’s going well, what’s not going well, if we need to tighten things up. So we are not aware of any violations.” Kotroba added that he would like to be notified by investigators about potential violations in a timely manner going forward. “If you see something wrong, we need to fix it immediately, rather than gather all these violations,” he stated. “It’s almost like you are gathering ammunition to come after us, and that’s not a working relationship.” Meanwhile, police announced that the list of arrests as of Wednesday is as follows: Derek Steven Jackson , 29 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Bullitt Bar , where police said he worked as a promoter/manager. However, Kotroba told News 6 that Jackson has never been an employee there. Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Derek Steven Jackson, 29 (Orlando Police Department) Darius Montreal Smith , 29 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Swiggs , where he worked as a security guard Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine, unlawful use of a two-way communication device Darius Montreal Smith, 29 (Orlando Police Department) Roderick Lawayne Pringle, Jr. , 27 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Room 22 , where he worked as a bar-back Charges : Sale/delivery of cannabis Roderick Lawayne Pringle, Jr., 27 (Orlando Police Department) Mitch Abdul Brown Harper , 51 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Fixtion Restaurant and Bar Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Mitch Abdul Brown Harper, 51 (Orlando Police Department) Vincent Michael Cardone , 31 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Fixtion Restaurant and Bar , Underground , Bullitt Bar , and Taco Kat Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine (four counts), possession of cocaine (four counts) Vincent Michael Cardone, 31 (Orlando Police Department) Prince Oghenevwegba Doghor , 22 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Shots Charges : Sale/delivery of cannabis Prince Oghenevwegba Doghor, 22 (Orlando Police Department) Martin Cabrera Santos , 28 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Taco Kat Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Martin Cabrera Santos, 28 (Orlando Police Department) Joel Jesoel Sanchez , 22 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Fixtion Restaurant and Bar Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Martin Cabrera Santos, 28 (Orlando Police Department) Brandon Smith , 32 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Room 22 Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Brandon Smith, 32 (Orlando Police Department) Daniel Jusino Garcia , 29 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Taco Kat Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Daniel Garcia, 29 (Orlando Police Department) Christian Rivera , 24 Sold illegal narcotics to undercover officers at Monkey Bar Charges : Sale/delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine Christian Rivera, 24 (Orlando Police Department) Get today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily : Copyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.

Whether you're an experienced restaurant owner, bar manager, or new to the industry, you know that the success of your bar largely depends on your team's skills and expertise. In this guide, we'll share ten vital tips for training your staff. These tips will equip them to offer outstanding service, handle challenging situations, and stay abreast of the latest industry trends. Let's begin our journey towards building a top-performing bar team. Training bar staff: Laying the foundation for success As we embark on this journey, it's crucial to acknowledge the heart of our mission: training bar staff isn't just about teaching them the basics, it's about sculpting the pillars of your establishment's success. In a world where customer demands and industry trends are constantly evolving, the importance of equipping your team with the right skills and knowledge cannot be overstated. This is where our guide steps in, offering you insights and strategies to ensure your staff doesn't just meet but exceeds your customers' expectations, guaranteeing an exceptional experience every time. Let's dive into the world of bar staff training with a clear goal – to create a seamless, enjoyable, and memorable atmosphere for your customers. When running a successful bar, the quality of service the staff provides can make all the difference. From crafting the perfect cocktail to providing excellent customer service, a well-trained bar staff can elevate the overall experience for customers. One aspect of training a new bartender that cannot be overlooked is product knowledge. It's not enough for bartenders to know ways of mixing drinks; they must also have a deep understanding of the various spirits, wines, and beers they serve. This knowledge allows them to make recommendations, answer questions, and create unique and personalised drink experiences for customers. Another crucial aspect of bartender training is teaching them the art of mixology. This goes beyond simply following a recipe; it involves understanding the different flavour profiles of various ingredients and how they can be combined to create innovative and delicious cocktails. By providing training in mixology, bar staff can become true artisans, able to create signature drinks that set your establishment apart from the competition. Customer service is also a key component of bar staff training. Bartenders must be skilled in their job's technical aspects and possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills. They should be able to engage with customers, anticipate their needs, and provide a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. By focusing on customer service training, you can ensure that every interaction between your staff and customers is positive and memorable. Furthermore, training bar staff should include education on responsible alcohol service. New bartenders must be aware of the signs of intoxication and know how to handle difficult situations, such as dealing with unruly customers or cutting off someone who has had too much to drink. By providing this training, you can promote a safe and responsible drinking environment for your customers. In addition to the technical skills and knowledge, training bar staff should include teamwork and efficiency sessions. A well-coordinated bar team can handle high volumes of orders with ease, ensuring that customers are served promptly and efficiently. By fostering a sense of teamwork and providing training on efficient workflows, you can create a well-oiled machine that keeps the drinks flowing and the customers happy. In conclusion, training bar staff is a crucial investment for any establishment wanting to provide an exceptional customer experience. Equipping your team with the necessary knowledge and skills ensures that your bar stands out from the competition and becomes a go-to destination for people seeking quality drinks and outstanding service. Understanding the bar staff's role: key points It's essential to grasp the multifaceted role of bar staff before delving into tips on training your staff. Here are the key areas they cover: Customer service : as the face of your establishment, bar staff need to be friendly and attentive, offering personalised recommendations and handling complaints effectively. Maintaining cleanliness : keeping the bar area clean and organised is vital for customer satisfaction and hygiene standards. This includes regular cleaning of counters, taps, and glassware and proper disposal of waste. Service efficiency : bar staff should be adept at managing multiple orders, preparing a wide range of drinks quickly and accurately, and possessing good time management skills. Responsible alcohol service : recognizing signs of intoxication, refusing service when necessary, and ensuring legal drinking age compliance are crucial for promoting a safe drinking environment. By understanding these core responsibilities, you can better train your bar staff to excel in their roles, ensuring a smooth operation and a memorable customer experience. 10 tips on how to train bar staff Okay, let's dive into tips now. Whether you're refreshing your bar training program or starting from scratch, these insights will be invaluable in shaping a proficient team of experienced bartenders. Let's dive in and explore these top tips for training your bar staff to excellence. Tip 1: Embrace Technology in Training In today's digital age, technology has become an invaluable tool in training. Incorporating interactive training modules, online courses, and virtual reality simulations can greatly enhance your training program. This modern approach allows your bar staff to learn at their own pace and engage with the material in a more immersive way. Interactive training modules offer a dynamic learning experience for your bar staff. These modules can include quizzes, videos, and interactive exercises that test their knowledge and skills. By incorporating gamification elements, such as leaderboards and rewards, you can create a sense of competition and motivation among your staff. And AI course creation tools like Lingio can help you here. Tip 2: Focus on Product Knowledge A well-informed bar staff member can confidently guide customers through the menu and offer recommendations. Invest time in training your staff on the various types of beverages, ingredients used, and the art of mixology. This knowledge will not only boost their confidence but also enable them to provide exceptional service. When it comes to running a successful bar, product knowledge is key. Your bar staff should be well-versed in the different types of beverages you offer, from classic cocktails to craft beers and fine wines. By understanding the unique characteristics and flavor profiles of each drink, they can effectively communicate this information to customers and help them make informed choices. Training your staff on the ingredients used in your drinks is equally important. From the spirits and liqueurs to the fresh fruits and herbs, knowing what goes into each cocktail or beverage allows your staff to answer any questions customers may have about allergens, dietary restrictions, or specific preferences. This level of attentiveness and knowledge will impress your customers and make them feel confident in their choices. Furthermore, mastering the art of mixology is a valuable skill that can set your bar apart from the competition. Encourage your staff to experiment with different flavor combinations, techniques, and presentation styles. By constantly expanding their mixology repertoire, they can create unique and memorable drinks that will keep customers coming back for more. Providing your bar staff with comprehensive product knowledge training not only benefits your customers but also boosts the overall morale and confidence of your team. When your staff feels confident in their abilities to guide customers through the menu and offer recommendations, they will be more engaged and motivated to provide exceptional service. Remember, product knowledge is an ongoing process. As new beverages and trends emerge, make sure to keep your staff updated through regular training sessions and tastings. By staying ahead of the curve, your bar will continue to be a go-to destination for those seeking a memorable and knowledgeable drinking experience. Tip 3: Customer Service Excellence Outstanding customer service sets apart successful bars from mediocre ones. Emphasize the importance of attentiveness, friendliness, and going the extra mile to create memorable experiences. Role-playing scenarios and providing feedback can help refine their customer service skills. When it comes to running a bar, customer service is key. It's not just about serving drinks; it's about creating an atmosphere where customers feel welcome and valued. That's why it's crucial to emphasize the importance of attentiveness. Encourage your staff to be observant and proactive in anticipating the needs of customers. Whether it's refilling a drink before it's empty or offering suggestions for new and exciting cocktails, being attentive can make all the difference. Friendliness is another essential aspect of customer service excellence. A warm smile, a genuine greeting, and a friendly conversation can go a long way in making customers feel comfortable and appreciated. Encourage your staff to engage with customers, ask about their preferences, and remember their names. Building a personal connection with customers not only enhances their experience but also encourages them to become regular customers. Going the extra mile is what truly sets apart exceptional bars from the rest. Encourage your staff to think outside the box and find creative ways to surprise and delight customers. This could be anything from offering complimentary snacks or samples of new drinks to organizing special events or themed nights. By going above and beyond, you create memorable experiences that customers will rave about and share with their friends. One effective way to refine customer service skills is through role-playing scenarios. Create different scenarios that your staff may encounter, such as dealing with an unhappy customer or handling a busy night with limited resources. By practicing these situations in a controlled environment, your staff can develop the necessary skills to handle real-life situations with confidence and professionalism. Providing feedback is also crucial in improving customer service excellence. Regularly check in with your staff to discuss their performance and provide constructive criticism. Recognize their strengths and areas for improvement, and offer guidance on how to enhance their customer service skills. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement, you can ensure that your bar consistently delivers exceptional customer service. Tip 4: Health and Safety Compliance Ensuring health and safety regulations are followed is paramount in any bar setting. Train your staff on proper hygiene practices, responsible alcohol service, and emergency procedures. Regularly review and reinforce these guidelines to maintain a safe environment for both employees and customers. When it comes to running a successful bar, one cannot underestimate the importance of health and safety compliance. Not only does it protect the well-being of your employees and customers, but it also safeguards your business from potential legal issues and reputational damage. In this section, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of health and safety compliance that every bar owner should be aware of. First and foremost, proper hygiene practices should be a top priority in any bar establishment. This includes regular handwashing, sanitizing surfaces, and maintaining clean and well-maintained facilities. By implementing a strict hygiene protocol, you can minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses and the spread of germs among staff and customers. Additionally, responsible alcohol service is crucial for maintaining a safe and controlled environment. It is essential to train your staff on how to identify and handle customers who may be intoxicated or underage. By adhering to responsible alcohol service practices, you not only protect your customers from harm but also prevent potential liability issues for your bar. Emergency procedures should also be a key component of your health and safety compliance plan. Train your staff on how to respond to various emergencies such as fires, medical incidents, or altercations. Having well-trained employees who can handle these situations effectively can make a significant difference in minimizing potential harm and ensuring the safety of everyone present. Regular review and reinforcement of health and safety guidelines are crucial to maintaining a safe environment in your bar. Conduct periodic training sessions to refresh your staff's knowledge and address any new regulations or best practices. By staying up-to-date with the latest health and safety standards, you demonstrate your commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for your customers. In conclusion, health and safety compliance should never be taken lightly in the bar industry. By prioritizing proper hygiene practices, responsible alcohol service, and emergency procedures, you create a secure environment for both your employees and customers. Remember, a well-managed bar that prioritizes health and safety will not only attract more customers but also protect your business from potential liabilities. Tip 5: Efficient Operation and Workflow Management An efficient operation is key to delivering prompt service, especially during peak hours. Teach your staff effective time management techniques, such as prioritizing tasks, organizing workstations, and optimizing workflow. Implementing clear communication channels and well-defined roles will also contribute to seamless operations. Tip 6: Upselling and Sales Techniques Upselling not only benefits your business but also enhances the customer experience. Train your staff on suggestive selling techniques that are both persuasive and genuine. Encourage them to recommend complementary food and beverage pairings, highlight specials, and showcase unique offerings. Tip 7: Handling Difficult Situations Difficult situations can arise in any bar setting, ranging from unruly customers to challenging complaints. Provide your staff with conflict resolution skills, empowering them to handle such scenarios calmly and professionally. Role-playing exercises and case studies can help them develop the necessary problem-solving skills. Tip 8: Teamwork and Communication Effective teamwork and communication are foundational to a well-functioning bar. Encourage an environment of collaboration and open communication among your staff members. Foster a strong team spirit through team-building activities and regular staff meetings to address concerns and share best practices. Tip 9: Continuous Learning and Development The bar industry is constantly evolving, with new trends and techniques emerging regularly. Encourage your staff to continuously learn and develop their skills by attending workshops, industry events, and tastings. Offer opportunities for growth and recognition to keep them motivated and engaged. Tip 10: Utilizing Feedback for Improvement Feedback is essential for growth, both for individuals and the business as a whole. Implement a system for collecting and analyzing feedback from customers and colleagues. Regularly review this feedback with your staff, addressing areas of improvement and celebrating successes. Creating digital courses for bar personnel Incorporating digital courses into your training program can have numerous benefits. Harness the power of technology to create engaging and interactive modules that cater to different learning styles. You can make learning more enjoyable and memorable by leveraging multimedia elements, quizzes, and assessments. Here are four things you should consider when planning training programs and courses. #1 Planning Course Content A well-structured training course is essential for providing a comprehensive learning experience. Plan the course content to cover essential topics such as bartending techniques, customer service, responsible alcohol service, and menu knowledge. Break the content into easily digestible modules to ensure effective learning. #2 Designing Engaging and Interactive Modules Monotonous training can quickly lead to disengagement. Design modules that are visual, interactive, and fun. Utilize videos, infographics, and interactive quizzes to break the monotony and grab the attention of your bar staff. Gamification elements can also make the learning process more exciting. #3 Integrating Real-World Scenarios Real-world scenarios provide valuable context and practical application for your bar staff. Include case studies, role-playing exercises, and simulated situations to mimic real-life scenarios. This approach allows your staff to practice their skills in a controlled environment, boosting their confidence when encountering similar situations on the job. #4 Regular Course Evaluation and Updates Continuous improvement is key in training. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your courses through feedback from learners and trainers. Use this feedback to update and enhance your training modules based on emerging industry trends and changing customer expectations.
