Originating from the vibrant culture of Jamaica, their story is a compelling narrative of ambition, perseverance, and a unified dream to forge an exceptional legacy. What started with a singular restaurant concept has flourished into an expansive empire that stands as a testament to their hard work and dedication. Why Empire Liquors Stands Apart Their journey reached a pivotal moment when they acquired the entire plaza surrounding their initial restaurant, a strategic move that paved the way for the inception of Empire Lounge & Liquors. This expansion was not just a growth in space but a leap towards realizing their dream of creating a comprehensive, immersive experience for their patrons. Owning the plaza allowed Bull and Shernett to seamlessly integrate their offerings, setting the stage for Empire Liquors to source its own premium spirits. Committed to Our Community and Environment This innovative approach ensures that both the Empire Lounge and their affiliated restaurants serve unique, high-quality beverages that align with their standard of excellence. Empire Liquors stands as a beacon of their ambition, offering an exquisite selection of spirits that are as diverse and rich as the journey that led to their creation. Under Bull and Shernett's stewardship, Empire Liquors doesn't just sell spirits; it invites customers into a story of empire-building, where every bottle shares a piece of their dream turned reality.
