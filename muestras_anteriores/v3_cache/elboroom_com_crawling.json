The owner says it’s unfair that they’re forced to stay closed while businesses around them have reopened. Fort Lauderdale Beach is open for business, but not for everyone. A state ban on bars in Broward is still in effect, and for Elbo room owner Michelle Penrod, it doesn’t make sense. Every restaurant has now turned into a bar,\" she said. \"You need to order an appetizer and you can sit here and drink all day. We are prepared to open at half capacity. Whatever it takes.\" Area restaurants have certainly picked up where bars left off. Since they reopened, many of them have been packed, with little social distancing. \"People aren’t going to social distance, the ones that are responsible won’t show up, so it is what it is,\" she said. There is no timeline for the reopening of bars, especially since COVID cases in the state are on the rise. Copyright 2020 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.

By NBC 6 • Published March 24, 2023 • Updated on March 24, 2023 at 1:40 pm BOOKMARKER NBC Universal, Inc. The co-owner of the bar Elbo Room remains in a medically induced coma after suffering a fall at her Fort Lauderdale home last week that was investigated as domestic battery. Tracey Penrod suffered serious injuries in the Mar. 14 incident at her Fort Lauderdale home. Watch NBC6 free wherever you are WATCH HERE A heavily redacted police report that omits both Penrod's name and the name of the person listed as the offender states that there was an incident of aggravated battery at the Fort Lauderdale home. \"I need an ambulance right away! She fell off the banister!\" said a man heard screaming for help in a 911 call from the day of the incident. The 911 operator asked the man what happened, to which he replied, \"She was climbing over the banister, I don't know!\" “The nature of the circumstances surrounding this incident remain unknown at this time,” Fort Lauderdale Police spokesperson Casey Liening said last week according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel . Penrod's brother, Michael, told the newspaper his sister is in critical condition at Broward Health Medical Center with severe brain damage and broken ribs.
