Champions Club Curriculum for Teens & Adults Plan de Estudios Other Languages Locations Get Started Shop Cart Checkout About Select Page Hello! Do you want to get to know us better? Champions Club is a special needs ministry, specialized in ministering to, and designing developmental areas for kids, teens, and adults with special needs and the medically fragile. We have created a program that meets the developmental needs of individuals with special needs in four important ways: SPIRITUALLY, EMOTIONALLY, PHYSICALLY, and CREATIVELY . Core Value #1 We never, ever, turn away an individual. No matter how severe the situation may be. Core Value #2 Every person walking in to a Champions Club will feel loved and accepted. Core Value #3 We offer a holistic approach of care that develops the mind, body, soul and spirit. Core Value #4 We give tangible hope to every family with special needs and the medically fragile. Core Value #5 We create inclusive environments for those with special needs and secure opportunities for them to learn alongside their peers in typical environments. Core Value #6 We develop the gifts and talents of those with special needs so they can become everything God has created them to be. Even more about us ! Pastor Craig Johnson founded Champions Club in 2009. Find out more about our history and the heart behind our organization. Craig Johnson Founder of Champions Club Craig is a pastor, author, and advocate for those with special needs. He is currently serving as the Associate Pastor at Lakewood Church with Joel Osteen. Craig is not only the founder of Champions Club Developmental Centers and Champions Foundation, he is also the co-author of “Champions Curriculum”, a full scope Christian curriculum for individuals with special needs, as well as the books “Lead Vertically: Inspire People to Volunteer and Build Great Teams That Last”, and “Champion: How one boy’s journey through Autism is changing the world”. Craig & his wife Samantha co-wrote the inclusive children’s book “You Are Extraordinary”. Craig and his wife of over 30 years, Samantha, have three children: Cory, Courtney, and Connor. “We point those with extraordinary needs to their destiny and help them navigate how to get there.” Craig’s passion to advocate for families with special needs comes from his own family. Until two years of age, Craig and Samantha’s son Connor was just like other kids—playful, verbal, and affectionate. Then everything changed. He stopped talking, displayed behavioral problems, and withdrew into his own world. The official diagnosis: autism. Faced with seemingly insurmountable odds, Craig and Samantha refused to believe a meaningful life for Connor was impossible. God confirmed their faith by revealing to Craig that Connor would one day touch the lives of thousands of people around the world. Craig and Samantha held that unlikely promise in their hearts during the agonizing years ahead. Through the family’s unexpected journey, God has used Connor’s life that has launched a global ministry for special needs. Champions Club has been a blessing to my son’s life. At one point, my son’s school saw him as a troubled child. Champions Club saw him as a gifted child . Their guidance proved valuable to Zachary, his school and myself. Champions Club was the only one that said, “Yes, we can help your son.” Gail Medina Zachery's mom The Champions Club Curriculum is the root of our success as a ministry. Several other organizations have reached out to us to ask where we got such an amazing curriculum for our students with special needs.

Whether you are a high handicapper, a PGA pro, a beginner, a youth golfer, or any other segment of the sport, a custom club fitting is right for you. Anyone looking to find more distance, more consistency, better golf performance overall, or anyone looking to overcome issues like slices, low/high spin, or others should consider a comprehensive custom club fitting. Club Champion is brand agnostic and dedicated to finding the best possible club combination for every level of golfer. Our Master Fitters are trained to improve the golf game of any golfer through better equipment found with real-time data and industry-leading technology . More distance, improved accuracy, fewer putts, more confidence with your clubs — we work with you to find a solution for all your golf goals. WHEN SHOULD YOU GET FIT? Golfers should be fit for clubs when some or all of their equipment no longer suits their game. When a golfer feels their equipment is working against their natural swing motion or isn't providing the intended performance, it's time for a fitting check-up. Golfers may not need a brand new club or bag overhaul every time they visit — Club Champion can fit and optimize existing equipment as well as provide recommendations for new options based on data. HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU GET FIT? The \"latest\" equipment isn't always the best equipment for your unique swing. On average, golfers will be fitted for a full bag every 2-3 years. Some clubs, like wedges, should be updated more frequently based on factors like how often you play, playing conditions, etc. Grips should be replaced every season at minimum and simple adjustments like loft and lie should be considered annually to keep your fitted clubs performing optimally. That said, there are plenty of golfers who want to explore new releases every year — there is no limit to how frequently you can check in on your game. THE PROOF IS IN THE IMPROVEMENT 4.5/5 average over 5,000 Google reviews MORE FROM CLUB CHAMPION READ MORE ARTICLES CLUB CHAMPION DIFFERENCE: A.I. FITTER CO-PILOT Club Champion's proprietary A.I. Fitter Co-Pilot system allows for faster, more accurate club fittings and even better data. CLUB CHAMPION DIFFERENCE: MASTER BUILDERS Only Club Champion employs Master Builders and craftsmen to hand-build each and every custom golf club.

I'll share a bit of my experience here: I originally went to Club Champion because they have access to more exotic shaft options on hand, in particular for my driver. After doing my research, I narrowed down what I wanted to two different shafts. At my fitting, I was able to swing both of those, and they just weren't getting the results I wanted. Adam had me try a couple other options that I hadn't considered, and I was astounded by the results. Within 20 minutes, Adam had me dialed in to a new shaft that increased my ball speed, reduced spin, and increased the total distance of my driver by 23 yards . INCREDIBLE! After getting fit for the driver, we went through the rest of the bag; hybrid, irons, wedges, and putter. Adam had a no-pressure sales style, even at one time saying that I'd be a fool to replace the wedges I'm currently hitting, since the data showed he couldn't fit me into anything better. He didn't have any bias towards certain brands. He just wanted whatever works best for my swing. I appreciate that he's all about data and results, and not just trying to sell me as much as possible. Fast forward to this summer: I've had by far the best season of golf of my life, mostly because of my increased accuracy and length off the tee with my new driver and hybrid. Par 5s have started to surrender eagles and birdies more frequently, and I have much shorter approaches coming into the greens than I ever have. I was already a golf junkie beforehand, but my enjoyment for the game has been elevated to a whole new level this year. If you're serious about improving your game, don't spare the expense. There is so much more that goes into selecting a club than just picking a regular/stiff flex shaft. Unlike some of the other places you can go, these guys know what they're doing and are going to get you exactly what you need.\" — Jonny J. | Edina, MN × × \"Really pleased with my Club Champion fitting. Wasn't quite sure what to expect, my prior fittings (if you want to call it that) in a golf shop bay were based on a handful of demo clubs they had available to test. Stock items only, no selection or ability to try different shafts, etc. Now Club Champion is a whole different story. Racks and racks of shafts and clubheads...which actually was a bit daunting at first. Then met with Rich, a Master Fitter & Club Builder. He put me through the paces with my own clubs to establish a baseline and actually \"watch\" my swing. Then the tweaking began with different clubheads from different manufacturers and shaft combinations, with him picking up the nuances of my swing and finding the best combos. He could tell when I had a great shot as soon the ball left the clubhead, while we waited for the TrackMan to catch up and confirm just how great it was. I was impressed. I'm 69 years old, my mobility is not what it used to be, and I've been losing distance at a frustrating rate. BUT, I have to tell you after we were done, I was hitting the irons 20-30 yards further (with a slight draw, no less) than when I walked in the door. Amazing! Then on to the driver. We tried a few combos and came to the conclusion that I was hitting my existing driver pretty good as is. That in itself sold me on Rich as a club fitter and Club Champion as a company. Rich took the time, answered all my questions and had answers that I didn't even know the questions to ask. No pressure.\" — BG | Del Mar, CA × × \"This was the first time I'd had a club fitting. I've not had the opportunity to play that often, but retirement is just around the corner and I want to get back into the swing of golf. Taylor was the best! He was extremely knowledgeable about the right club type, weight, and length to match my swing . I saw firsthand through the advanced technology the difference a club change made. Taylor helped me with a full bag fitting. He did not try to push me into a club I did not need but truly focused on an actual reduction in club count. Can't wait to use my new clubs in the weeks ahead. I would highly recommend Club Champion and Taylor to a club fitting to get the best out of your game.\" — Dave W. | Charlotte, NC × × COMPLIMENTARY Get a Club Champion full bag fitting $100 off with an equipment purchase when you book and complete your fitting by 7/31/24.

If my account is not tagged to a client before an appointment, I may not be granted a commission. An individual sale’s commission percentage will be lowered if a junior/military/repeat discount is applied, or a non-Mill River discount is granted over 5%. The benefit package can change at any time at the discretion of Club Champion with written notice. Revenue Share: Qualifying Referrals – Referral commissions are only granted for referrals that come after partnership signing. A record of referral must exist for payment to be granted. No referral payment will be extended for an existing customer of Club Champion that predates the original partnership.

Lifetime Commissions – Commissions are paid for the lifetime of every qualifying referral for the life of partnership. Payments encompass the entirety of qualifying sales: shaft, head, grip, PUREing, customization, repairs and fitting fees.

OEM Orders — Any OEM or direct from manufacturer order will result in no commission payout, however, the order will still count towards a partner's yearend referral total and partner levels. Missed-Payment Window – Partners can qualify to request commission payments if they feel a qualifying referral has been missed. All requests are subject to review and proof of referral must be given by the partner. Commission payments will not be considered without written proof of referral.

Take a step-by-step look at what happens in the Club Champion fitting bay. Your fitter will get to know you and your game, along with any goals for your full bag fitting and budget considerations to keep in mind. You’ll stretch and warm up, then hit your existing clubs to set a baseline for the data we’re looking to beat. If you don’t have clubs, we can start out with a quick build from our demo matrix. For full bag fittings, we’ll work with you to pick a part of the bag — woods, irons, wedges — to start with and tackle one section at a time. Once we know what variables — ball speed, spin, launch angle, clubhead speed, distance, etc. — we want to improve, we will start with shaft options. Isolating one component at a time allows your fitter to dial in the basis of your improvement and build upon it as you go. When the best shaft profile and model is identified, your fitter will move on to clubheads and repeat the testing, using that ideal shaft for consistency. Now that you have the perfect shaft and clubhead, your fitter will finalize the details like length, lie, loft, swingweight, and grip choice before moving on to the next part of the bag and starting the process again. Once the full swing clubs are completed, you will then move to the SAM PuttLab putter studio to dial in your putter’s length, loft, toe hang, and more. There is a full bag fitting option without a putter fitting included should you want to skip the flatstick. Once everything is dialed in, you’ll be presented with a customized blueprint for lower scores — a build sheet showing you all the specs for each club, along with an itemized recommendation that lays out costs. After you place your order for a custom build by one of our Master Builders , we’ll keep you updated on your equipment’s progress via email and tell you more about our Perfect Fit Guarantee . × × Free Fitting with Custom Club Purchase Terms: Use the code provided to get a free Club Champion club fitting when you make a custom club purchase.
