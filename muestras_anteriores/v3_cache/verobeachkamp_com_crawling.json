Staff  very helpful and friendly. Some of the mossy oak trees need dead limbs trimmed especially those overhanging camp sites. Pool very nice.

Reply to this review Loving Life 1 reviews · 1 review votes Member 1 1 out of 5 stars 06/17/2019 Staff was rude, restrooms dirty, grass not mowed, trash in river, broken down RV's with boarded up windows. An old rusty RV sitting there. Construction equipment coming and going all the time. Noseiums are all over, we could not sit outside at all and no one even cares or told us about them. The bites hurt and there is nothing that will help. Helpful 10 Own this park?

When I called to make the reservation I asked specifically if there was Wi-Fi at all sites and was told yes. Shortly after arrival I tried to get Wi-Fi and although the signal appeared to be strong it was marked as \"Limited\". There was no internet access. When I called the office I was told \"sometimes it is down, try again later\", which I did to no avail. The next day again with no internet access I went to the office and was told it was down and they were waiting for the repair person. When I checked with some extended stay people at the park they said the WiFi had not worked for a very long time, so I was lied to repeatedly with regard to WiFi. Also, although they took my Good Sam number over the phone and quoted me the Good Sam rate, I had to ask repeatedly to get the 10% discount. The actual parking pads are extremely narrow and the hook-ups are all the way to the rear requiring additional sewer and water hoses. The grass also had not been mowed in awhile. There are numerous trees very close to the roadway around the rear of the park, making the ride to your site very interesting. The staff here were not very helpful, including the guide that led us to the site. We could have parked ourselves much easier. This is an over priced bare bones park not particularly close to any attractions. Read Less Helpful 12 Own this park?

An old rusty RV sitting there. Construction equipment coming and going all the time. Noseiums are all over, we could not sit outside at all and no one even cares or told us about them.

When I called the office I was told \"sometimes it is down, try again later\", which I did to no avail. The next day again with no internet access I went to the office and was told it was down and they were waiting for the repair person. When I checked with some extended stay people at the park they said the WiFi had not worked for a very long time, so I was lied to repeatedly with regard to WiFi. Also, although they took my Good Sam number over the phone and quoted me the Good Sam rate, I had to ask repeatedly to get the 10% discount. The actual parking pads are extremely narrow and the hook-ups are all the way to the rear requiring additional sewer and water hoses. The grass also had not been mowed in awhile. There are numerous trees very close to the roadway around the rear of the park, making the ride to your site very interesting. The staff here were not very helpful, including the guide that led us to the site. We could have parked ourselves much easier. This is an over priced bare bones park not particularly close to any attractions. Read Less Helpful 12 Own this park?

All three ratings categories are measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Less than 1 percent of parks or campgrounds receive the coveted 10 | 10 | 10 rating, which indicates superior facilities that are well maintained, clean, well-appointed restrooms and a highly appealing appearance. Campgrounds are inspected annually by dedicated RVers like you. Completeness of facilities 10 10 10 The first campground rating evaluates completeness and quality of facilities. In this category we rate interior roads, sites, registration area, hookups, recreation, swimming, security, laundry, store and building maintenance. Cleanliness of restrooms and showers 10 10 10 The second rating category concerns the cleanliness and physical characteristics of toilets, walls, showers, sinks/counters/mirrors and floor. If a park achieves a full point in each of the above, it receives a star ( ), indicating exceptionally clean restrooms. Also rated are physical characteristics of restrooms, including interior construction, adequate supplies/odor free, adequate number of facilities, exterior appearance and location in relation to park spaces, and interior appearance. Visual appeal and environmental quality 10 10 10 This category addresses the park's setting and site layout, function and identification of signage, overall exterior building maintenance, noise, trash disposal, litter and debris around the grounds and sites, and appearance of grounds, sites and entrance area.

There were mostly residential and long term residents. The sites were so small that the concrete pad that our picnic bench was on was one foot away from the next campers sewage pipe. It was disgusting and we couldn’t eat outside without being on top of others. We have a tiny 16’ camper and I can’t imagine staying in anything big.

Our site, and apparently most, had a concrete patio large enough for the included picnic table and few RiVer supplied folding chairs.  Gravel drive for car and trailer.  It looked big rig friendly.  The amount of shade available varies considerably between sites.  We had to ask for a fire ring.  Staff addressed this quickly.  Staff was great and helpful. Like a lot of campgrounds in Florida there were obviously a lot of permanent campers, many flown north for the summer this time of year.  We assume this is why the sewer hook up was poor for a quick and secure hook up. There was a lot of small trash in the site: wrappers, caps, straws, etc.  They need to do maintenance on sites between occupants. We didn't use the restrooms. We were in the area to visit relatives.  Not far to the beaches and things to do. Road noise and trains can be heard in the distance.

They do have a portion of the campgrounds as storage for some old campers, and what appears to be gas tanks, however these are located in the back.  Needed to use bug spray at night while we were there, however we are camping, gonna happen sometimes. Location is not far from some good food and bars, and getting to beaches was easy. Working remote, cell coverage was a bit spotty to maintain regular connectivity.  I needed to rely on my Winegard antennas and my ATT account, my usual stand alone hotspot on T-Mobile was getting intermittent speeds with mid-level signal strength and was not reliable enough for video calls.  Was fine for general emails.  I did not try the campsite's wifi, but it is offered.

As others have mentioned, they escort you to your spot and will also pick up trash left at the end of your spot by 11 AM, which are nice touches. While the beach was closed, it was not too far and there were some great places for a walk or run nearby. There's also great proximity to grocery stores and gas stations. If you prefer to relax at your site, they had a great cable selection and picnic tables at each site. Some sites were more shaded than others, but we backed up to a small creek and were level without having to use blocks. Everything seemed to be recently redone and well cared for - their website doesn't do the place justice. Would certainly stay here again!

We were surprised at how much there was to enjoy in Vero and Sebastian.  This campground is located conveniently to points of interest in both cities.  We enjoyed a Clam Bake at Sebastian's River Park, rode the jungle trail and dined in Vero Beach.  Much more than that to see and do there. The campground provided reliable, fast Wi-Fi.  Water pressure was great.  No issues with any utilities, or hookups.  When checking in, the campground has an escort on a golf cart take you to your spot and they help you back in to your site.  I thought this was nice and helpful.  We were assigned to site #322, but when we pulled in with our 35ft 5th wheel we requested to move down a few sites because it was tight and had some trees that would have been tricky with our rig.  They accommodated the move with no problem at all. Oh, but here's what I really was surprised by...if you leave your trash bags at the end of your site before 11am, they have someone come around for daily trash pickup.  Nice!

Scout Reviewed Jul. 31, 2025 Absolutely the worst choice Watch out for these predators — they will charge for anything they can, they won’t give refunds for early departures even when it’s family medical emergencies, the staff is wildly rude in the front office (you’d think at least one person who worked there wouldn’t be a complete horror show of a human, but no such luck). And they hose down their bathrooms which is just plain gross. The sites are too close together, and even in summer (low season) they’re too stupid to put any space between guests. If you can possibly stay anywhere else, do yourself a favor and keep away from this nightmare of a place. Site 205 Month of Visit July Share Report Moms S. Scout Reviewed Nov. 16, 2024 Aggressive breeds aloud without muzzels I stayed for 3 months, the place was lovely. But there is something very important to me I have a very docile golden retriever poodle. While I was there there was many pitbulls without muzzle witnessed a pitbull get loose from its owner and attacked two small dogs the dogs had to go to the veterinarian hospital I had to take my dog and pick him up and run and hide this happened right in front of me it was horrible. I don't know the fate of the other dogs but one couldn't walk. The man that was walking the Pitbull lost control of it because the Pitbull wanted to attack the other dogs in the park he slipped right out of his collar. I believe they shouldn't allow aggressive breeds and if they do they should be muzzled until then I would never come back here I love my dog I can't imagine the situation if it would have been my dog it scares me just the thought Share Report D David K. Guide Reviewed Aug. 30, 2023 Last minute Rocket launch watch We called Vero Beach Camp the morning of our stay and they welcomed our reservation for 1 night. Beautiful shaded campground, nice swimming pool, clean and quiet. We will definitely come back. The rocket launch was scrubbed so we will try again! Site 101 Month of Visit August (4) View All Share Report M Mark S. Traveler Reviewed Jan. 30, 2023 Vero Beach Camp Good Sam franchise - ok if you like everyone knowing your business. I would stay here again. Kinda high priced w no cancellation policy Site 213 Month of Visit February Share Report Thank you for your review Mark! We are happy to hear you will be kamping with us again! We actually do have a cancellation policy, you can read about it here: https://verobeachkamp.com/policies Happy Kamping until we see you again! 🏕⛺ Read More Ari A. Legend Reviewed Feb. 4, 2022 Not friendly to small rigs This was the first time we have ever bailed on a campground and we did it even though we knew finding an alternative was a long shot. The campground overall seemed ok, but they insisted on trying to cram us into one of three spots that weren't really campsites, just pieces of grass between other sites. Actual campsites had gravel pads, picnic tables etc., as one would expect. Treating Class B RV owners as second class citizens who can just take it or leave it when the site is unacceptable and still expect us to pay full price is a terrible business practice. We were able to get our balance refunded (because we bailed within the 1-hour deadline) but we assume our $250 deposit won't be seen again. The person working the desk said it's unlikely we'll receive it because we were a last minute cancellation. No, we didn't cancel. We refused to spend a month camped in the side yard of another camper who had a real campsite to stay in! We'd give this place 1 star but were generous and gave it 2 in case folks traveling with a larger rig are interested. It seems the normal sites they put those rigs in were fine overall. But beware and be prepared with a backup plan! Read More Month of Visit February Share Report William R. Traveler Reviewed Aug. 2, 2021 Nice stay Low key, quiet place, helpful staff.  Awesome shade (pretty critical in Florida this time of the year). Really can’t say anything bad about our experience here—stayed for a week—no complaints at all.

Mixture of overnight and long term campers. Only stayed 2 nights. Watched a rocket launch from out campsite. Share Report Amber H. Guide Reviewed Dec. 6, 2020 Wondeful Sites are decent size. Lots of sites with shade. Close to Indian River and the beach. Close to restaurants and groceries. On the highway, but traffic noise is minimal. Share Report D Denise K. Guide Reviewed Jun. 17, 2020 Resting up for the Keys Desperate for a place to pitch our tent rather than spending $$$ for a hotel, we lucked up when we found VBK on The Dyrt.  This quiet campground lined with moss covered oaks, palm trees and long leaf pines was a dream.  They are set up mostly for RVs but have a few campsites.  Our primitive campsite was at the far back.  Large, Quiet, shady and near a water source. We ended up sharing the site with another very pleasant family.  Heated pool, nice restroom and laundry facilities.  I didn’t have a chance to check out the activities room with bocce ball, shuttle board and horseshoes. It was great being able to camp on our way to Bahia Honda State Park. No hotel for us!
