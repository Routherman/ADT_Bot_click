Crews had promised to remove them by the end of last week . WINK News sent reporter Paul Dolan to the park to see if that promise was kept. Dolan found that a few boats still remain, though those boats are no longer in the water and just need to be transported. Crews faced several obstacles in removing the boats. Equipment couldn't initially reach the stranded boats due to the absence of a clear path for cranes. Once they addressed that issue, a rain delay further paused the project, leaving the boats stranded like statues. Punta Gorda Vice Mayor Greg Julien expressed his feelings about the delays. \"A little disappointed because we waited a long time, the city staff worked hard to get to this point. We had to wait on state resources, but finally it's all come together. And we had months of drought, and all of a sudden it's raining,\" said Julien. The completion date for the project remains unclear, but some boats still need to be removed. WINK News has reached out to the city for an updated timeline, who said we can expect a response by Monday.
