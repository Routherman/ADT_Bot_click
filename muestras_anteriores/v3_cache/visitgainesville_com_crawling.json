County Offices Business Resources Contact Us County Offices Growth Management Zoning Districts and Uses What is the purpose of Zoning? Zoning of land is the tool used by the County to regulate the use of property for the purposes of protecting public health, safety, and general welfare of the community. The purposes of Zoning are to regulate land use, prevent land use conflict, and allow growth to occur in a rational manner. What's my zoning? View the Use Table What is the difference between Zoning and Future Land Use? Future Land Use (FLU) is a generalized approach to land use, whereas Zoning is divided up into more detailed uses that support very specific types of development.\r\n            For example, the Commercial FLU designation is broken up into many Zoning districts, including BR (supports Retail uses), and BW (supports Warehouse uses). Zoning aims to: Use land for its most suitable purpose. Protect or maintain property values. Promote public health and safety. Protect the environment. Manage traffic. Manage density. Encourage a variety of housing types. Manage aesthetics. Provide for more orderly development. Help attract businesses and industry. Zoning Districts and Requirements Zoning districts implement the Future Land Use designations adopted on the Future Land Use Map 2040 .

This 'client-favorite' event brings together Arc clients, employees, visitors and community VIPs for a day of food, fellowship and fun. The Gainesville stop was just one of many for these bicyclists who bike nearly 1,000 miles from Miami to Tallahassee in the month of May to help raise money and awareness for people with developmental disabilities. This year's visit included a police escort by Santa Fe College's Police Department, a photo shoot, a client autograph session, a luncheon catered by David’s BBQ, and a dance led by Mr. October DJ, Michael Davis. After leaving The Arc, bicyclists enjoyed an afternoon of swimming and relaxation at the gorgeous Gainesville Health & Fitness Center, dinner from Satchel’s Pizza, and bedding down at First United Methodist Church. The bikers headed off early the next morning for their next stop - Jacksonville. The Arc of Alachua County thanks all of our vendors, sponsors, clients, employees, and bicyclists representing Gear Up Florida/The Ability Experience for a fabulous event. We look forward to seeing you all in May 2026!

Who Is The Arc? The Arc of Alachua County is a community based organization committed to providing a continuum of exemplary \n                services, supports, and advocacy to assure that people with developmental disabilities can enjoy respect and \n                dignity and be full participants in the community.

Tweets by @TheArcAlachua Take A Look At Us I am sure it is no surprise to you, but people always want to know what we have been up to around The Arc and at our events. Our followers on facebook get to see quite a few or our pictures, but the rest of you are left in the dark. Well even though everyone should be our fans on facebook , we still decided to put up a gallery of images to show some of the highlights from the major events we have had this year. Every year we hold several events we consider picture worthy.  But dont worry, you will probably see some other, \"non event\" pictures sneak in as well.  If you have a good picture you would like to share, stop by The Arc and let us scan it and share it as well. We hope to keep the new gallery up to date throughout the year, so check back and enjoy.

The Alachua County Labor Coalition (ACLC) is composed of individuals, unions, and worker-friendly organizations committed to the economic, environmental, civil, and social rights of working people, their families, and communities, and to the ecological systems that sustain us. Our principles and goals are adapted from the national Labor Party’s “Call for Economic Justice.” We are the people who build and sustain the nation, but rarely enjoy our fair share of the wealth we create. We are the employed, the unemployed, and the retired. We are the people who make the country run, but have little say in running the country. We remain dedicated to building a more just society, where we all have the right: –To be paid a living wage in a safe workplace, to be treated fairly at work, and to not be fired unjustly. –To join a union freely and to strike without fear of being fired or other retribution. –To a life where the needs of our families do not have to be neglected because of the demands of our jobs. –To retire at a decent standard of living after a lifetime of work. –To free, quality public education for ourselves and our children. –To universal access to publicly-funded, comprehensive, quality health care for all residents. –To live free from bigotry and discrimination, where everyone enjoys equal opportunity and the equal protection of the laws without prejudice. –To honor and respect the human rights of workers across the world.
