History Fire Rescue Department History Prior to 1974, fire protection in St. Johns County was provided through an interlocal agreement with the City of St. Augustine. The St. Augustine Fire Department responded to structure fires within ten miles of the city, while the rest of the county relied on ten independent volunteer fire departments funded solely by donations. In 1974, a taxing ordinance was introduced to fund these volunteer departments. This system lasted until 1995, when population growth and increased demand led to several studies and a plan to improve emergency services. Key recommendations included formalizing the relationship between the County and volunteer departments and consolidating Emergency Medical Services (EMS) with the fire service. The plan was implemented in October 1997, creating the County’s first career firefighter staff with 48 cross-trained EMS paramedics and seven career firefighters. Despite this, volunteer departments struggled with increasing service demands, population growth, and stricter training mandates. As volunteer numbers dwindled, the County began staffing engines and stations with career firefighters. In 2002, a Master Plan was developed to enhance existing services and prepare for future growth. Approved by the Board of County Commissioners in 2003, this plan ensured funding for St. Johns County Fire Rescue. Today, the department employs over 300 professional firefighters across 17 stations. Fire Chiefs Fire Rescue Chief Sean McGee On March 19, 2024, the St. Johns County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) unanimously approved Sean McGee as the new Fire Chief of St. Johns County Fire Rescue. McGee has been with St. Johns County Fire Rescue for 25 years, starting as a firefighter, and was promoted to various ranks in the department. He served as Battalion Chief for the past 11 years. 2019-2022 Fire Rescue Chief Jeffrey A. Prevatt Chief Prevatt began working part-time for St. Johns County Emergency Medical Services in the fall of 1980, completing training as an Emergency Medical Technician in 1981. He officially started his career full-time for St. Johns County on February 1, 1982, becoming certified as a Paramedic in 1983 and a Firefighter in 1985. Chief Prevatt advanced through the St. Johns County Fire Rescue ranks, serving as a Lieutenant, Captain, Battalion Chief, Deputy Chief, and Assistant Chief. He also worked part-time for several years for the emergency helicopter service at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville.  During his tenure, Chief Prevatt has been the manager of multiple major projects and progressive improvements. Also, he was the project manager and department representative on the $25 million 800 MHz county-wide interoperable radio system. He coordinated the research, development, and implementation of this highly prioritized public safety project, finalized in 2013. In 2019, Chief Prevatt was appointed Fire Rescue Chief, managing, and overseeing all aspects of Fire Rescue Services. 2011-2018 Fire Rescue Chief Carl A. Shank Chief Carl A. Shank was directly involved in delivering emergency services in St. Johns County for over 25 years. Chief Shank began as a volunteer in the Palm Valley area then transitioned to a full-time St. Johns County employee in January 1987. Appointed Operations Chief in 2001, Chief Shank helped plan and build the re-organization of Fire Rescue services countywide. In 2008, he was appointed to the position of Assistant Chief, which he held until he assumed the roles and responsibilities as the St. Johns County Fire Rescue Fire Chief in December 2011. Chief Shank was involved in the professional development of the countywide emergency response capabilities, the statewide emergency response system, and his personal career development throughout his career.
