Construction is anticipated to be completed in February 2024, and the park will open to the public in Spring 2024, weather permitting. A ceremonial dirt toss was conducted, which included the following individuals: St. Johns County Capital Improvement Project Program Manager Jason McKay St. Johns County Public Works Project Manager Phyllis Thorpe St. Johns County Parks and Recreation Assistant Director Jamie Baccari St. Johns County District 5 Commissioner Henry Dean Vilano Beach Main Street President Linda LaCerva St. Johns County Parks and Recreation Director Ryan Kane St. Johns County Assistant County Administrator Sarah Taylor St. Johns County Public Works Director Greg Caldwell The ceremony began with remarks from St. Johns County Parks and Recreation Assistant Director Jamie Baccari. “I’m so proud to be a part of an amazing team that, over the next few years, will present the community with several exciting park projects,” Baccari said. “I am particularly proud to announce this project because it began back in 2007. The County, with the help of a number of residents, purchased the old Fiddler’s Green restaurant through a Florida Communities Trust Grant for $5.5 million. The Parks team made minor improvements in 2008, but then, sadly, the original building sat vacant and had to be demolished in 2013. In 2019, the Board of County Commissioners funded the completion of this project by allocating $1.1 million toward the design and construction of the final phase of this park. In 2020, the board approved an additional $700,000 for the project to complete construction, giving a final budget of $1.8 million. This project would not have been possible without the continued support of our County Commissioners, especially Commissioner Henry Dean, and our County Administration, including Joy Andrews, Brad Bradley, Sarah Taylor, and Colin Groff.” “This property has a great history, but we’ve got a better future ahead,” Commissioner Dean said. “We should all share in this opportunity to celebrate what was and what will be.” The park will bring another much-needed outdoor space for recreation and building community to the county, including the following amenities: Improvements to the northern walkover to bring into ADA compliance. Renovation of existing restrooms. Construction of a covered performance stage with terraced seating. Construction of new outdoor showers. Construction of changing stations. Installation of a new climbing play structure and recreation features. Renovation of the existing south walkover. Addition of ADA parking in the existing parking lot. Matthews DCCM (formerly Matthews Design Group) and POND were the design consultants on the project, with E.B. Morris General Contractors, Inc. leading construction. St. Johns County will fund the renovation project’s $1,814,400 budget through Park Impact Fees and Tree Bank Fund.

Home Government Departments Planning & Development Planning Division Short-Term Vacation Rentals Short-Term Vacation Rentals Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation's Recommended Safety Measures and Best practices for vacation rentals. Vacation rentals must adhere to Duval County safety measurements and guidelines. Guide to Vacation Rentals and Timeshare Projects Overview Short-term vacation rentals are privately owned dwelling units that are rented to guests more than three times in a calendar year for periods of less than 30 days or one calendar month, whichever is less, or which is advertised or held out to the public as a place regularly rented to guests as defined by Florida Statutes . Short-term vacation rentals are permitted in zoning districts where residential uses are permitted. Single-family, townhouses, and multi-family units being used as transient public lodging establishments are required to obtain a Short-Term Vacation Rental Certificate. Property's Zoning District Homestead Exemption In accordance with City ordinance, all existing short-term vacation rentals that require a certificate are required to make an application to the City of Jacksonville Beach. Applications can be submitted to the planning and development department at city hall, located at 11 3rd street north. An owner-occupied dwelling unit renting 50% or less of the unit is not subject to the short-term vacation rental regulations. Read more about the Homestead Exemption and how a short-term rental may affect your ability to qualify for the exemption. Renting your Homestead - Understanding the impact of renting your Homestead on exemptions Please contact TouristTax@coj.net for more information regarding Duval County vacation rental requirements. Obtain a Short-Term Vacation Rental Certificate If you are a property owner or a licensed agent for a property management company, you must apply for a short-term vacation rental certificate for every property being used as a short-term vacation rental.

Short-Term Vacation Rental Unit Property Compliance Inspection An inspection of a short-term vacation rental unit is required prior to the initial issuance of and/or modifications to a Short-Term Vacation Rental Registration Certificate. In accordance with City ordinance, an inspection of the rental unit will be conducted by the Fire Marshal by appointment only. If violations are found, all violations must be corrected and the unit must be re-inspected prior to issuance of the registration certificate. The inspection shall be requested by the Responsible Party. Failure to provide the Fire Marshal access at the scheduled time will result in a \"no show\" fee of $100. Incomplete applications will not be accepted. The fee for initial and annual registration for each property is $150. The annual fee for a Local Business Tax Receipt is $79.20 for each property. The fees for County and State licenses and certificates can be found on their websites.

We are in a green shift – a transformation. OceanFront is part of this shift. We are transparent, believe in what we do, and are proud of our contribution to meeting the UN’s Sustainability Goals. We have defined the following of the UN’s Sustainability Goals as crucial in our work. Our company is Eco-Lighthouse certified. This means that we have implemented concrete and profitable sustainability measures, which we believe will have great significance for the company’s competitiveness in the years ahead. We are a member of NOSCA Clean Ocean NOSCA Clean Oceans is an innovation cluster with 40 members from all over the country – industrial companies, entrepreneurs, premise givers and research and educational institutions. We work daily to create a world-leading arena for knowledge development, technology development and innovative solutions in the management of marine pollution – oil spills, undesirable effects of marine organisms (such as algae, seagrass, and jellyfish) and other marine waste (such as marine plastics). We focus on sustainability and emphasize innovation that covers the entire value chain – detection, classification, collection, and disposal. Nosca.no We will create a cleaner sea and specialize in retrieving man-made elements from the seabed using technology, innovative solutions, and experience from other marine and maritime industries. We do this without the use of people underwater to reduce both risk and costs in the operations. Our goal is to become the best and preferred player to remove unwanted elements and waste from the seabed. 94% of the waste in the sea sinks to the bottom. When we now have 5 floating continents of waste in the world’s oceans, it gives a picture of what is currently suffocating the seabed. By removing unwanted elements, we will recreate a natural seabed, which provides a better tomorrow for life in and by the sea. Such measures are crucial to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to the UN’s sustainability goal number 14. Our driving force is to preserve life underwater and take care of the ocean as the heart and lungs of the planet. High integrity We must be true to our mission and vision. We must always show humanity and have an honest and fair demeanour. We must have firm, unwavering attitudes in line with the UN’s sustainability goals. Sustainable Our operation and execution/delivery must be in line with the UN’s sustainability goals and the measures it may entail. Innovative We will always seek to challenge established practices in all stages of operation and delivery to increase quality and efficiency.
