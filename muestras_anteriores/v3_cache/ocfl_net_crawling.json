Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman announced Tuesday that search warrants were carried out at 11 locations as part of “Operation Dirty Pond,” an investigation into the handling of public funds allocated for the aquatic center project at Salt Lake Park in Huntington Park. The investigation, which began in November 2022, focuses on allegations of financial mismanagement involving city officials and contractors. Among the locations searched were Huntington Park City Hall, the city’s public works yard, and the proposed aquatic center site. Investigators also searched the residences of current and former Huntington Park city officials, including Mayor Karina Macias and City Councilmember Eddie Martinez. Reyes, who serves as Huntington Park’s city manager, was among those whose homes were searched. It remains unclear what specific role, if any, he may have played in the alleged misuse of funds. “My office is committed to ensuring that public officials uphold the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and transparency,” Hochman said. “When concerns arise about the use of public funds or the actions of those in office, it is our duty to investigate thoroughly and protect the public’s trust.” Investigators seized public records, financial documents, computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices as part of the probe. The Bureau of Investigation searched the following locations: City of Huntington Park, City Hall, 6550 Miles Ave., Huntington Park, CA City of Huntington Park Public Works (City Yard located east of Salt Lake Park),  6900 Bissell St., Huntington Park, CA Salt Lake Park (Proposed site for aquatic center), 3401 E. Florence Ave., Huntington Park, CA Residence of Edvin Tsaturyan and Sona Vardikyan (Owners of JT Construction Group, Inc.), Glendale, CA Residence of Efren Martinez (former Huntington Park City Official), Los Angeles, CA Business Office of Unified Consulting Services, LLC, Huntington Park, CA Residence of Ricardo Reyes (current Huntington Park City Manager), Downey, CA Residence of Graciela Ortiz (former Huntington Park City Councilmember), Huntington Park, CA Residence of Marilyn Sanabria (former Huntington Park City Councilmember), Huntington Park, CA Residence of Karina Macias (current Huntington Park Mayor and City Councilmember), Huntington Park, CA Residence of Eddie Martinez (current Huntington Park City Councilmember), Huntington Park, CA The case is being handled by the District Attorney’s Bureau of Investigation and reviewed by the Public Integrity Division. Authorities are encouraging anyone with information regarding the aquatic center project to contact Sgt. Robert L. Jackson at 213-257-2511.

Read Bio Lori Administrator A Few Words From Dr. Acree In Memory of Dr. Isenhower 11/14/1971-06/27/2019 Dr. Kevin Isenhower and I had a very special relationship. He was family, he was my partner in dentistry, and he was my best friend. One of my fondest memories of him is when he was considering dentistry as a change of profession from IT. One day he asked to shadow me at my office, and I remember how amazed I was with how well he connected with people-both patients and the dental team. People could sense from him that he was caring and kind and that it was real, not just professional kindness.Â Kevinâs family meant so much to him. I know his career and decisions made were to give his family the best life possible. He loved the holidays and weekends when he could spend time with family and friends, often treating them to some of his wonderful BBQ as his expression of love. He adored his wife, Kim, and was not shy about letting it be known. His thoughtful and caring way with her is one of the qualities I admired most. Kevin was also extremely proud to be a dad and loved talking about his amazing children, Elizabeth, Kathryn, John, and William. Many of our conversations were centered around stories of proud-dad moments. He enjoyed tutoring Liz in chemistry, he bragged about Katieâs baking skills, was proud of Johnâs accomplishments in football, and enjoyed Willâs energy and excitement for life.Â Kevin had many friends from his days in high school, dental school, and time spent at First Baptist Church. He treasured these relationships. Kevin was easy to know, he did not ask for much as he just enjoyed being with people. Some of my fondest memories with Kevin were discussing difficult dental cases, treating our team to an office BBQ lunch, and our weekend fishing trips. I will cherish these times together always. At Downey Park Family Dentistry, we are proud to be a part of the Modesto community and our service extends further than our office walls. Throughout the year, we give back to Modesto by volunteering our time and talent during mission trips and offering free dental work for patients in need through multiple nonprofits.

He won an Academy Award for the 2023 biopic Oppenheimer . By Biography.com Editors and Tyler Piccotti Updated: Jul 30, 2024 11:50 AM EDT Getty Images 1965-present Robert Downey Jr. Now: Iron Man Actor Returning to Avengers Movies Robert Downey Jr. is known for playing one of Marvel’s most beloved heroes. Now, he’ll return as one of its most diabolical foes. The 59-year-old Downey—who portrayed Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, in three titular films and 10 movies total— is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the villainous Doctor Doom in the next Avengers installment, titled Avengers: Doomsday , in May 2026. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige revealed Downey’s surprising role in Avengers: Doomsday on July 27 at San Diego Comic-Con. The actor removed a silver mask before gesturing toward the crowd and receiving thunderous applause. “New mask, same task,” Downey quipped in a video by the Associated Press . “What did I tell you? I like playing complicated characters.” The Stan Lee –created Doctor Doom, real name Victor von Doom, is known as the primary antagonist for the Fantastic Four, who are set to make their MCU debut in The Fantastic Four: First Steps in July 2025. Avengers: Doomsday is scheduled for release in May 2026. Jump to: Who Is Robert Downey Jr.? Quick Facts Childhood Early Movies and SNL Movies of Critical Acclaim Substance Abuse Problems Move to Television with Ally McBeal Box Office Hits Awards for Oppenheimer Wife and Children Path to Sobriety Height Net Worth Quotes Who Is Robert Downey Jr.? Actor Robert Downey Jr. is best known for his portrayal of Tony Stark, a.k.a superhero Iron Man, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film franchise and roles in movies like Chaplin and Tropic Thunder . Downey made his first movie appearances and was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s, but his growing success was marred by years of struggles with drug abuse. Eventually turning his life around, he earned a resurgence of critical and widespread acclaim and is now considered one of Hollywood’s A-list actors. Downey gave an Oscar-winning performance as Lewis Strauss in the 2023 biopic Oppenheimer and will return to the MCU in 2026 as villain Doctor Doom. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Robert John Downey Jr. BORN: April 4, 1965 BIRTHPLACE: New York City SPOUSES: Deborah Falconer (1992-2004) and Susan Levin (2005-present) CHILDREN: Indio, Exton, and Avri ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries Childhood Famed actor Robert Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in New York City, the son of the avant-garde filmmaker Robert Downey Sr., best known for the 1969 film Putney Swope . Downey began acting as a young child. His mother, Elsie, was an actress who instilled in her son a love of performing. Raised in Greenwich Village with his older sister, Alison, Downey made his film debut playing a puppy in his father’s film Pound (1970), in which actors played dogs. He would go on to have small parts in several more of his father’s films. Downey’s parents divorced when he was 13, and the young actor ended up living in Los Angeles with his father. At 16, however, he dropped out of high school and was on the move again, relocating to New York to live with his mother. Early Movies and SNL Downey made his earliest feature film appearances in such films as Baby, It’s You (1983), Firstborn (1984), Weird Science (1985) and Back to School (1986). From 1985 to ’86, he was a regular cast member of Saturday Night Live , NBC’s popular sketch-comedy program. Learn About Other SNL Alumni Eddie Murphy Adam Sandler Chris Rock The Pick-up Artist and Less Than Zero Downey’s first leading role on the big screen was as a charming womanizer in The Pick-up Artist (1987), a romantic comedy co-starring Molly Ringwald written and directed by James Toback. His breakthrough performance came in 1987 with Less Than Zero (1987), where he co-starred with Andrew McCarthy. Downey played the party-loving, cocaine-addicted Julian Wells in the film. Movies of Critical Acclaim By the early 1990s, Downey had established a reputation as a critically acclaimed A-List actor. He earned praise for his comic turn as a shifty soap opera producer in Soapdish (1991), co-starring Sally Field , Kevin Kline, and Whoopi Goldberg . More adoration followed when Downey landed a featured role in Short Cuts (1993), the critically lauded ensemble film by Robert Altman. Chaplin Getty Images Robert Downey Jr. plays with his hat in a scene from the 1992 film Chaplin . A particular high point in Downey’s career came in 1993 when he was nominated for an Academy Award (Best Actor) for his performance in Chaplin (1992), directed by Richard Attenborough. In the highly acclaimed film, which didn’t go over nearly as well with audiences as with critics, Downey nimbly portrayed the legendary Charlie Chaplin from ages 19 to 83. The role displayed his dramatic range and his considerable talent for physical comedy. By this time, the 27-year-old Downey had come to be seen as one of the most gifted actors of his generation, but he had also earned a reputation as a troubled and controversial figure in Hollywood. Natural Born Killers and Richard III In the wake of his critical success with Chaplin , Downey anchored a documentary about the 1992 presidential election, The Last Party . In 1994, he appeared in the romantic comedy Only You , and in Oliver Stone ’s acclaimed but controversial Natural Born Killers . The following year, the actor starred in the period film Restoration alongside Meg Ryan and Sam Neill; an updated film version of Richard III , co-starring Ian McKellen and Annette Bening ; and the Jodie Foster -directed Home for the Holidays , also starring Holly Hunter. Substance Abuse Problems While Downey’s acting prospects appeared on track, his personal life would be in turmoil for the next few years. Downey was introduced to drugs at the age of 8 by his father and developed a full-fledged addiction as he headed into his 20s. “Until ( Less Than Zero ), I took my drugs after work and on the weekends,” he later explained. “Maybe I’d turn up hungover on the set, but no more so than the stuntman. That changed on Less Than Zero ... The character was an exaggeration of myself. Then things changed, and, in some ways, I became an exaggeration of the character. That lasted far longer than it needed to last.” A stint in drug rehabilitation followed shortly afterward, but Downey’s struggles with drugs and alcohol would persist for years. In June 1996, the actor was stopped by police after driving naked in his Porsche on Sunset Boulevard and found not only to be without clothes but in possession of cocaine, heroin, and a .357 Magnum. Less than a month later, and just a few hours before he was slated to be charged, Downey ran afoul of the law again after he was found passed out in a neighbor's house. For the next several years, Downey’s life was a haze of headline-generating, dependency-induced mistakes and their consequences. There was a 12-month stay in prison and another visit to drug rehab. In November 2000, Downey was again arrested, this time in a Palm Springs hotel room, where he was discovered with cocaine and in a Wonder Woman costume. He was charged with felony drug possession. Downey’s trial, initially set for late January, was delayed for several months while his lawyers negotiated with prosecutors. In March 2001, the two sides failed to reach a plea bargain, and the case was set for a preliminary hearing at the end of April. On April 24, 2001, Downey was arrested for allegedly being under the influence of an undisclosed “stimulant.” Move to Television with Ally McBeal Despite his turmoil in the early 2000s, Downey continued working. He gave a memorable performance in Wonder Boys (2000) and had roles in several other films, including Auto Motives and Lethargy . Additionally, Downey moved to the small screen in 2000, becoming a regular cast member of the popular show Ally McBeal , starring Calista Flockhart. Downey once again reminded fans and critics of his talent, likability, and versatility with this new role. He went on to pick up a 2001 Golden Globe Award and won a Screen Actors Guild Award soon after. But Downey’s increasingly complicated personal life pressed his employer's patience. After that second arrest in April 2001, Downey's tenure on Ally McBeal ended; producers had decided to wrap production of the final episodes of the season without the actor. Around this same time, lawyers reached an agreement with prosecutors that required Downey to plead no contest to cocaine-related charges. He was sentenced to three years’ probation—a ruling that allowed him to continue live-in drug treatment instead of returning to prison. Downey didn’t return to scripted dramatic television until 2024, when he portrayed five different characters in the Max miniseries The Sympathizer . His performances earned him a supporting actor nomination at the 2024 Emmy Awards . Box Office Hits Working his way back to prominence, Downey in 2003 starred opposite Halle Berry in Gothika , which fared better at the box office than it did with the critics. He continued to dedicate himself to his craft, playing a supporting role in the critically acclaimed Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) and the lead in the independent drama A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints (2006), which he also co-produced. In Zodiac (2007), Downey plays a journalist who gets wrapped up in the hunt for the infamous Zodiac Killer. Tropic Thunder Taking a huge risk, Downey starred in the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008) with Ben Stiller and Jack Black ; he played a white actor pretending to be a Black actor in this war movie spoof. His efforts received primarily positive reviews, with Variety magazine’s Todd McCarthy stating that “the audacity of Downey’s performance” was one of “the best reasons to see the film.” Downey garnered numerous accolades for his performance in Tropic Thunder , including Oscar (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role), Golden Globe (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture), and Screen Actors Guild (Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role) nominations. Iron Man and The Avengers Franchise (Photo: Marvel Studios) Robert Downey Jr. first had a starring role as Tony Stark in the 2008 film Iron Man. That same year, Downey established himself as a box office star by playing wealthy industrialist-turned-crime fighter Tony Stark in the smash hit Iron Man , based on the Marvel Comics superhero. The film grossed more than $318 million domestically, leading to the release of sequels in 2010 and 2013. Stark would also become one of the central characters in the series of Marvel Cinematic Universe films that followed, headlined by The Avengers in 2012 and its three sequels later in the decade. The movies featured a bevy of Hollywood talent as iconic Marvel heroes, including Chris Evans (Captain America), Don Cheadle (Colonel James “Rhodey” Rhodes), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Samuel Jackson (Nick Fury) and Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), among others. Downey would reprise his Stark/Iron Man dual role for Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015); Captain America: Civil War (2016); Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017); Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). In July 2024, Marvel Studios announced Downey will return to play villain Doctor Doom in a new installment titled Avengers: Doomsday in 2026. The Soloist and Sherlock Holmes Downey went on to share top billing with Jamie Foxx in The Soloist (2009), which tells the story of the friendship between a Los Angeles journalist (Downey) and a homeless Juilliard-trained musician (Foxx). The film registered a respectable showing at the box office and earned praise from critics, who lauded Downey and Foxx for their performances. Demonstrating he isn’t afraid of blockbusters (or English accents), Downey co-starred in the Guy Ritchie-directed Sherlock Holmes in 2009 alongside Jude Law as Dr. John Watson. The duo teamed up again for the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows . Downey also offered a turn as sharp city lawyer Hank Palmer, opposite Robert Duvall, in the drama The Judge (2014). Dolittle After a half-decade of appearing solely in Marvel-branded features, Downey reemerged as host of the YouTube series The Age of AI beginning in late 2019. In January 2020, he starred as a veterinarian who talks to animals in Dolittle , based on the classic children’s book series by British author Hugh Lofting. Awards for Oppenheimer Downey took a short hiatus from the big screen following Dolittle and focused on his work as a producer. In 2022, he appeared in and served as an executive producer for Sr. , a documentary film about the life and career of his father. However, Downey Jr. would draw critical acclaim for his next big performance in 2023, portraying Lewis Strauss in the blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan . Although Nolan had not worked closely with the actor in the past, he contacted Downey directly regarding the role and invited him to read the screenplay for the movie—about American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb. “I felt like (Downey) just was in a place where he would be ready to come and try something completely different. And as a director, if you can convince one of the great actors of his generation to come and challenge himself in a completely different way, you just know you’re going to get something special,” Nolan told Vanity Fair .

Jean Tatlock: The Woman Oppenheimer Loved Oppenheimer , also starring Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Florence Pugh , and Matt Damon , became the third-highest-grossing movie of the year globally and was universally praised. In 2024, Downey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor along with comparable awards at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, Critics’ Choice Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Wife and Children Getty Images Robert Downey Jr. and his wife Susan attend the 2024 BAFTA Film Awards in London. In contrast to his prior history with the law, Downey has a much more stable home life these days. He met producer Susan Levin on the set of Gothika in 2003, and the two were engaged in November of that year. They married in August 2005 and have two children: son Exton, born in February 2012, and daughter Avri, born in November 2014. In June 2010, Downey and Levin began their Team Downey production company, producing films and TV shows such as The Judge (2014), Dolittle (2020), and the Netflix fantasy series Sweet Tooth . “We don’t like going too long without having an extremely difficult project together, whether it’s a movie or a kid,” Downey said jokingly in 2020. Downey also has his eldest son, Indio (born September 1993), from his prior relationship with singer and actor Deborah Falconer, whom he married in 1992. The couple separated in 1996 and finalized their divorce in 2004. Downey’s friend and fellow actor Anthony Michael Hall is Indio’s godfather. Path to Sobriety Downey began to seek serious treatment for his drug addiction around 2003 and has maintained his sobriety amid his career resurgence. One of the people to play a key role in the actor’s turnaround was Mel Gibson , with whom Downey co-starred in Air America (1990). Gibson stuck by his friend’s side, even as Downey’s life was completely unraveling. When Downey was unable to get something as routine as an insurance bond due to his past troubles with the law, Gibson found him work, casting him in the 2003 film The Singing Detective. The two actors remain close friends today. In December 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown pardoned Downey for the 1996 drug conviction that sent him to prison for a year. Height According to his IMDb profile , Downey is 5 feet, 8 inches inches tall. Net Worth According to Celebrity Net Worth , Downey’s total value is around $300 million. Much of his fortune stems from his MCU appearances as Stark. The actor made $75 million from Avengers: Endgame alone thanks to the film’s box office performance. Quotes I think part of my destiny has to be realizing that I’m not the poster  boy for drug abuse. I’m just this guy who  has a really strong sense of wanting home and wanting foundation and  having not had it, I now choose to create it. I don’t drink these days. I am allergic to alcohol and narcotics. I break out in handcuffs. Until [“Less Than Zero”], I took my drugs after work and on the weekends. Maybe I'd turn up hungover on the set, but no more so than the stuntman... The character was an exaggeration of myself. Then things changed, and, in some ways, I became an exaggeration of the character. That lasted far longer than it needed to last. Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
