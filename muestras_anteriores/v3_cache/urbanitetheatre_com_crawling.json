      "text": "Review: Sarasota’s Urbanite Theatre opens season with powerful play News Sports Ticket Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals THEATER Urbanite Theatre opens new season with powerful and funny new play Jay Handelman Sarasota Herald-Tribune Playwright Morgan Gould packs a lot of humor, emotion, insight and catharsis into her roughly 70-minute play “Jennifer Who Is Leaving,” which had a “soft” but powerful opening Friday night at downtown Sarasota’s Urbanite Theatre after two hurricanes disrupted the rehearsal schedule. The theater space has been transformed by scenic designer Jeff Weber into a Boston area Dunkin’ Donuts shop that looks so real that a patron used a non-working bathroom that is part of the set as if it were the real thing while another grabbed a prop doughnut and coffee that were on the set. That shop is where a trio of women at different stages of their lives have an unexpected chance to joke, complain and tease about problems with the men in their lives. They’re surely speaking for all women. They feel unappreciated or taken for granted. For years they have persevered and in the middle of this particular snowy night, things are about to hit a tipping point in a story that jabs at the heart and the gut. Jennifer is a caregiver stuck in the shop waiting for a tow truck with her cantankerous patient, Joey, who is in some stage of dementia. It doesn’t take long to understand why this married mother of two is at a breaking point. Joey kicks chairs, curses, spits out the doughnuts he’s offered and generally makes Jennifer feel helpless. She gets some much-needed emotional support from Nan, the kindly overnight doughnut shop manager who tries to lighten the mood with stories about her family, interrupted frequently by calls from her seemingly incompetent husband, Chuck. He can’t find his car keys or cook his own meals without her help over the phone. Nan talks to him with a mix of patience, frustration and a tenderness that he may not deserve but which flows naturally from this maternal woman. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. And then there’s the high school student, Lili, who is stressed in other ways. Her father forced her to work her overnight shift despite the snowstorm and the SAT test that she has in the morning. Lili is eager to score well to attend the college of her dreams. Each of these women puts up with or is controlled by the men in their lives, and they deal with worry and distress by opening up about their feelings, letting loose with some dancing to Whitney Houston and sharing funny stories tinged with bitterness that had Friday’s crowd roaring with laughter and stung by the hard truths. Realistic performances from a strong ensemble Gould’s script and Céline Rosenthal’s sensitive staging draw you in with humorous phone calls and anecdotes before it moves in for the kill. The play takes some dark turns that reveal a view of women’s lives and experiences that most men likely don’t usually observe or realize. Rosenthal’s terrific cast delivers compelling performances that feel all-too-real and shift tones quickly but naturally. There’s a thin line between laughing and crying. Producing Artistic Director Summer Dawn Wallace returns to the stage after five years as the weary and overwrought Jennifer, who is hanging on by a thread, but has always managed to pull herself back from the edge. As Nan, Suzanne Grodner is simultaneously hilarious, accepting and heartfelt. You can see the tears in her eyes as she listens to Jennifer’s troubles, and you feel her good nature in the way she encourages Trezure B. Coles as Lili to find some calm before she explodes with anger about her exam and the way she is treated by her father. Arts Newsletter: Sign up to receive the latest news on the Sarasota area arts scene every Monday Community center to become a theater: Sarasota Players finally finds new home in Payne Park Auditorium And Ned Averill-Snell is perfectly on the mark as Joey, both belligerent and helpless as his character comes and goes from lucidity. Anyone who has dealt with a friend or family member with dementia will recognize the honesty of his performance. Gould keeps her story tight. As harsh and real as some of the scenes may be, the production allows you to leave with a sense of exhilaration and a greater awareness of the troubles women face. I would love to hear some of the conversations that will follow as audience members head home with their spouses and partners. ‘Jennifer Who is Leaving’ By Morgan Gould. Directed by Céline Rosenthal. Reviewed Oct. 18. Through Dec. 1, Urbanite Theatre, 1247 Second St., Sarasota.

Meanwhile, Jennifer is doing her best to ignore Joey, the aging patient wearing down her…patience. At the same time, Lili is overwhelmed by the looming pressure of the SAT exam and her father’s insistence that she go to work the night before the test. Set in a lonely Dunkin Donuts alongside a Massachusetts highway, JENNIFER, WHO IS LEAVING poignantly and humorously captures the demands placed on women, delving into the physical, emotional, and mental toll of caregiving–and the moments that push us to the edge.

SEASON 12 PASSES ON SALE NOW TOO FAT FOR CHINA NEW: MODERN WORKS FESTIVAL HEADLINING PRODUCTION TOO FAT FOR CHINA follows Phoebe Potts, comic storyteller and professional Jew, as she tries, fails and eventually succeeds to adopt a baby. After a US adoption goes horribly wrong, Potts finds herself surprised, disgusted and ultimately resigned to the role she plays as a middle class white lady in the business of adopting babies in the US and internationally. Potts’ tragicomic journey is about looking for more love, more life and more family and will do anything to get it, including having her morals and values fold in on themselves. ​ Written, drawn, and performed by Phoebe Potts ​ Performance times: SEPTEMBER 11 @ 7:30pm , SEPTEMBER 12 @ 7:30pm , SEPTEMBER 13 @ 2:00PM & 7:30PM , SEPTEMBER 14 @ 2:00PM BOOK SINGLE TICKETS SEE WITH A FESTIVAL PASS WELCOME TO SEASON 12 Explore the full season lineup and purchase a Season Pass now. EXPLORE ABOUT THE 2025/2026 SEASON For Season 12, we’re charting new territory with an expanded Modern Works Festival, our first musical, and a lineup that pushes the boundaries of both our space and our imaginations. ​ ​ This season, we’re diving into the monsters we face: those within us and around us, shaped by the forces of fame, power, and survival. ​ It’s a season of transformation for our artists, our audiences, and the Urbanite space itself. We can’t wait to welcome you back to the theatre. EXPLORE THE FESTIVAL Playing September 10, 2025 to September 21, 2025 Back at Urbanite Theatre for the sixth year, the Modern Works Festival has expanded into a two-week celebration of women in theatre! New to this year's Festival is the addition of a fully staged headlining production. TOO FAT FOR CHINA , written, performed, and illustrated by Phoebe Potts, will be presented as a five-show run at the top of the Festival. Then, join us for staged readings of three new works by three women playwrights. 1999 by Stacey Isom Campbell, AHOY-HOY by Jenny Stafford, and SCREEN TIME by Sarah Cho. ​ Sprinkled throughout the Festival will be a guest speaker event, featuring Nan Barnett, Executive Director, National New Play Network; a round table; and a kick-off party. EXPLORE THIS SHOW Playing October 31, 2025 to December 7, 2025 Remy Washington, a Black man and widower, has inherited both a drive-in movie theater and the responsibility of raising Pup, his late husband’s straight, white teenage son. The two forge a strong bond around a shared love of classic American monster movies, but when Remy discovers that Pup has been tormenting a gay classmate, their relationship begins to fracture, and the real horrors surface. ​ Beneath the flickering glow of the drive-in screen, MONSTERS OF THE AMERICAN CINEMA becomes a haunting, funny, and unexpectedly tender tale of fatherhood and loss that the Los Angeles Times hails as “exhilarating.” EXPLORE THIS SHOW Playing January 9, 2025 to February 15, 2026 It's January 2020. Jane has been placed on leave from her Big Tech job after a viral workplace incident. She's hell-bent on returning, but first, her assigned therapist, Loyd, needs to authorize it. Loyd suspects her work might be doing more harm than good. ​ A tightly wound psychological thriller, JOB zooms in on two careerists of different generations, genders, and paradigms to examine what it means to be a citizen of the internet and our obligation to help the people who need it most. EXPLORE THIS SHOW Playing March 20, 2026 to ApriL 19, 2026 It's 22 years into the future, and honeybees are nearly extinct, except for those kept alive in labs. When a shocking event leads to an even more shocking boost in bee populations, an overqualified new lab assistant, Zora, and her talkative co-worker Pilar must decide just how far they'll go to keep the population growing... and the whole thing under wraps from their overstressed, budget-conscious supervisor, Gwen. ​ Named a New York Times Critc's Pick, this \"bright, strange and mesmerizing marvel\" is a provocative comedy about sacrifice and the ethics of discovery, penned by 2022 Modern Works Festival finalist Kate Douglas. EXPLORE THIS SHOW Playing May 29, 2026 to June 21, 2026 The sharp-witted, glamorous, incomparable Eartha Kitt commands the spotlight.

Log In About Us The Urbanite Arts & Film Festival was founded in 2021 by Alex Armando Torres, a self-taught filmmaker and photographer. As an Afro-Latin Gay male who did not see himself represented either in front of or behind the camera, he started producing works that focused on diverse under represented voices. Voices that have unique stories to tell. With that in hand, Alex decided to create this festival to give those voices a chance to tell their stories, one unique voice at a time. Mission The Urbanite Arts & Film Festival’s mission is to foster the next generation of filmmakers that are underrepresented in the film industry. Launching its inaugural festival in August 2025, Urbanite Arts & Film Festival will highlight underrepresented voices including, but not limited to, young women, BIPOC, LatinX, LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, and the neuro-diverse communities. Through exhibition of their art, we create a platform for a diverse range of young artists to express themselves creatively and launch creative careers. Vision The festival’s vision is to feature short films, photographs, short films and show case spoken word over the course of one weekend in August 2025. As the festival grows from year to year, the vision is to grow the festival to be international and more inclusive. Our vision is to offer avenues and classes to those under-served to help young adults on their journey. Its success will be measured by the number of submissions, the demographic, geographic location of submitting artists, the number of featured works, and ticket sales. Urbanite Arts & Film Festival will follow up with filmmakers and artists after 1, 3, and 5 years to see how they have progressed in their craft and what their educational paths have been. They will be surveyed on if they have continued filmmaking, and if so what impact the Urbanite Arts & Film Festival had towards the development of their craft. Repeat submissions and selections by the same filmmakers and artists (for example, submitting films in their sophomore and senior years of high school) will be measured as a sign of success. Board of Directors Our board of directors is made up of a diverse group of members from the film industry, and non-profit sector as well as a host of other areas in business that make this board very well-rounded and unique in its ability to bring about a wonderful event every year.

Producing theater is hard,” she said. The company’s tenth season featured three world premieres and one regional premiere. For season 11, Wallace has scheduled one world premiere and three regional premieres along with the fifth Modern Works Festival, which puts a focus on female playwrights. The festival also has been a source of future full productions for the company. She hopes that during the season Urbanite will secure the funding to launch another round of play commissions, like the Charles Rowan Beye New Play Commission that led to several new works. “It’s a lot to take on but I think we can do that,” Wallace said.

Wallace and Ragan first announced Urbanite in 2014 with support from their third partner, developer Harry Lipstein, who built the theater in downtown Sarasota that can hold between 50 and 70 people. From the start, the company has focused on works that are either brand new or new to the Sarasota area. The company has built a dedicated group of supporters “who are passionate about the work we do. I think the foundations that support us and the individuals that support us do so because they believe in the work,” Wallace said. Here is a look at Urbanite Theatre’s 2024-25 season. Fifth Modern Works Festival Sept. 4-8 This event puts a focus on emerging female playwrights, new works and women in theater. It features staged readings of three new plays, discussions, panels and parties. Audience members, panelists and guest adjudicators will vote for their favorite work, and the winning playwright will receive a $3,200 prize. “Jennifer, Who is Leaving” By Morgan Gould. Oct. 18-Dec. 1 This regional premiere is a thought-provoking comedy set at a Dunkin’ Donuts store outside Boston, and looks at the demands placed on women within society, “what they do to make everything work, to keep it all going and what happens when one flips the script,” Wallace said. “It deals with the haves and have-nots and how, depending on your situation, you can get stuck.” It will be directed by Céline Rosenthal, associate artistic director of Asolo Repertory Theatre. “Spaceman” By Leegrid Stevens. Jan. 3-Feb. 16 Terri Weagant, who starred in Urbanite’s 2017 production “Bo-Nita,” returns in this one-person play about an astronaut who attempts to become the first to reach Mars, following her husband’s failed attempt. Wallace, who will direct, describes it as a “weightless, full-sensory, surround-sound exploration” of the challenges of space travel and the future Molly faces when she finally reaches Mars. “No One is Forgotten” By Winter Miller. March 21-April 27 This play is about two U.S. citizens who are being held prisoner in a small cement cell. The audience doesn’t see how they got there and doesn’t know where they are or how much time has passed, or if they’re even alive. It is based on true accounts of captured and detained journalists and aid workers. Wallace said she loves the play’s structure. “We pick up in the middle of their journey. We miss the pleasantries. How did we get here and how are they attempting to survive.” The play echoes Urbanite’s early beginnings. “We could do it with just a mat, but it also requires phenomenal, incredible performers.” “From 145th to 98th St” By Nia Akilah Robinson. May 30-June 29 This world premiere follows a slightly estranged family whose son has been misidentified in a crime. The parents are thinking about their kids finally being out of the house, as they deal with the tensions that develop because of their situation. The parents sacrificed to give their kids a better life, moving neighborhoods to protect them. “You just fall in love with this family. You can see yourself, even if your background is totally different,” Wallace said. Performances are at the Urbanite Theatre, 1487 Second St., Sarasota. There are several subscription packages available from $118 to $215. For more information; 941-321-1397; urbanitetheatre.com Follow Jay Handelman on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .

      "text": "Urbanite Theatre losing one of its co-founders and artistic directors News Sports Ticket Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals THEATER Urbanite Theatre co-founder departing for new position in Chicago area Jay Handelman Sarasota Herald-Tribune When they launched Urbanite Theatre nine years ago as an intimate home for new and provocative plays, FSU/Asolo Conservatory graduates Summer Wallace and Brendan Ragan were ahead of a growing curve of theater companies that are run by more than one artistic leader sharing responsibilities. But after producing more than 50 local plays, many of which they either directed or performed in, Ragan plans to leave in April to become artistic director of Metropolis Performing Arts Center in Arlington Heights, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. Wallace will become Urbanite's Producing Artistic Director and one of the few female leaders of a Sarasota area theater company. “It’s tough because when you start something from scratch, you find yourself working on it at hours of the day that you wouldn’t normally be working in a different kind of job because you love it and feel it belongs to you,” Ragan said.

Not only is this a wonderful professional opportunity, but it’s also a personal opportunity for me as well. I had a tough period of reflection when I needed to think of whether I wanted to take it, but ultimately found it to be an easy decision.” Wallace said the new job is a “wonderful opportunity for Brendan to move to a bigger city and for him to work for a company on a bigger scale, with bigger budgets, bigger staff and bigger shows.” Urbanite’s theater space, which was built by the duo’s former business partner, Harry Lipstein, for the company on Second Street in downtown Sarasota, seats between 50 and 70 people, depending on the production design. World premiere: Veteran tries virtual reality to treat PTSD in Urbanite Theatre production Meet Brian L. Boyd: Rising actor finds a home at Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe A new twist on traditions: Ringling Bros. brings back 'Greatest Show' for 50-city tour. But is it still a circus? Since the company made its debut with the American premiere of “Chicken Shop” in 2015, Wallace and Ragan have divided the work load, but both were involved in season planning and casting. Ragan handled more of the marketing aspects and Wallace oversaw contracts and negotiations with guest artists. Nearly a decade of growth The company also has grown from a two-person operation to a team with four full-time staff members and several part-time employees. Wallace said she is excited about being sole artistic director and having more autonomy, while also overseeing new strategic planning for the future. “One of my goals is to really institute more planning for the company so Urbanite outsurvives me and we have a long-lasting footprint in the community.” She hopes to expand educational programming with interns and do more with artistic fellows who will work for a year, or on specific productions. Ragan said Metropolis produces its own works, presents as many as 70 one-night performances (cabaret shows, bands, comedians), and has an active performing arts school with classes throughout the year and a summer camp. It employs professional actors and produces much larger productions than Urbanite could afford to stage or fit in its intimate space. Upcoming productions include the musicals “Ragtime” and “Xanadu.” “I’m yearning to take on a big majestic musical or a big classic comedy. That’s certainly part of a theatermaker’s vocabulary.” He said he is confident that Urbanite will thrive after he leaves. “Theater by its very nature was meant to change. One of the motivating factors in deciding which works to do is have we done something like this before, have we told this kind of story, have we had this topic,” Ragan said. “Urbanite will stay that way. It will constantly look at topics and people and ideas. That’s one of the reasons people love coming to Urbanite because of the surprise.” Follow Jay Handelman on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .

Load your video to YouTube or Vimeo, and send us the link. We will not accept emailed video files. 3. On YouTube, please make your video setting PUBLIC or UNLISTED.

Please write \"Audition Video - MONSTERS\" in the subject field. ​ ​ CASTING PHILOSOPHY Urbanite Theatre strives to create an inclusive artistic home by casting as broadly and diversely as possible. We acknowledge that many roles we list fall on the gender binary, but invite transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary performers to read for the roles (cisgender or otherwise) they most identify with. We gladly embrace actors of all physical abilities, and we will make reasonable accommodations in order to cast performers, regardless of disability, in any role. Unless the required race or ethnicity of a role is intrinsically tied to the dramatic action or plot, we will cast any race or ethnicity in all roles. Roles will be identified as \"Open Ethnicity\" unless the script requires otherwise. We believe the theater should always be a refuge from harassment and oppression, and we continue to work to make opportunities more accessible. If you feel there may be something more we can do to pursue that goal, or if there are any accommodations we can provide, please contact us at info@urbanitetheatre.com and write \"Casting\" in the subject field. ​ AUDITION ADVICE The fundamental identity of Urbanite Theatre has always been prioritizing people over production. We're interested in relentlessly talented professional artists, and we have exceptionally high standards for our actors. At the audition, be familiar with your sides, enough to act with presence, action, and sensitivity. Better to make choices than impress with your memorization skills. Arrive early and have a copy of your side and headshot and resume. We want you to be perfect for the role as badly as you do. As artists ourselves, we also understand the pressure of auditions. Take a deep breath,  be yourself, make choices, and Break a leg! Stay in the loop: sign up for our audition announcement list. ​ ​ ANNOUNCEMENTS Stay up-to-date on the latest news on upcoming Urbanite productions by signing up for our newslett er: SIGN UP HELPFUL LINKS Buy Tickets | Subscribe | Parking | S upport | Your Visit | Contact LOCATION 1487 2nd Street Sarasota FL, 34236 CONTACT (941) 321-1397 info@urbanitetheatre.com FIND US ABOUT US bottom of page"
