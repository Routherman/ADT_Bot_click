(Willie J. Allen Jr./Orlando Sentinel) By Amy Drew Thompson | amthompson@orlandosentinel.com | Orlando Sentinel UPDATED: May 1, 2024 at 12:29 PM EDT One year ago, Forward/Slash Distillery & Blending House had barely been open a month but co-founders Tim Bradstreet and Michael Buffa, blenders of American whiskey, wanted to acknowledge this signature spirit’s signature sporting event. But they didn’t have much time to slap together a soirée. Throwing out a few announcements on social media, letting folks know that they should dress for the occasion, they didn’t expect a huge turnout, but customers came in droves to sip and sample in their race-day finery, which inspired the pair to plan a redux for 2024. Tart it up for Kentucky Derby day with this mini-Hot Brown appetizer And these papas got a brand new barrel. Seventy pounds of Southern Hill Farms peaches went into the mix for this peachy potable, and the pair will be parsing it out in beautifully mixed peach juleps over “ice crushed to order by the hammer of Thor,” says Buffa. Staffers here headed to the Clermont farm to procure the fruit, which was in full swing during the peach season (a tiny window here in Florida). “It’s an insane ratio of peach to bourbon,” says Bradstreet. “Super sweet, so we back off on the amount of sugar that goes into the julep.” A Peach Julep, the featured cocktail for the Kentucky Derby party at Forward Slash Distillery. (Willie J. Allen, Jr./Orlando Sentinel) Like the season itself, this bourbon is a limited edition, so you’ll want to hit Forward/Slash (650 S. Capen Ave. in Winter Park) on Derby Day (May 4) to sample. If the barrel lasts longer, it might be a day or two. But fear not, for these Winter Park whiskey makers have a stash you’ll want to sample regardless. Buffa and Bradstreet met several years back through the Orlando Whiskey Society , which Buffa founded in 2015 with a devotion that’s skin-deep. (Literally, art from his favorite distillery, Compass Box, is tattooed on his arm.) At the time, he was riding a wave of success with Buffa Bitters, working with Manifest Distillery up in Jacksonville. The product was doing well, but Buffa was tired of the round trip, hoping to do something closer to home. Co-owner and Whiskey Maker, Tim Bradstreet checks the barrels filled with their specialty whiskeys at Forward Slash Distillery in Winter Park. (Willie J. Allen, Jr./Orlando Sentinel) Bradstreet, meanwhile, was riding his own wave of success as the beverage director of the World Center Marriott. It was a wave that never crashed, though. Long hours were arduous, in particular as the birth of his first child approached. He, too, was looking for a new gig and like magic, a position with pristine demands materialized at the Gaylord Palms. Bradstreet was home by 6 p.m. every night. It was 2019, though. Like the rest of us, Bradstreet was blissfully unaware of the meteor that was about to hit. The gig lasted five months before COVID-19 crashed the party. It was a blessing and a curse, for with far less to do, the pair — whose friendship had grown into one of burgeoning business partners — had time to dig deeper into their distillery dreams. The Forward/Slash bar room. (Willie J. Allen Jr./Orlando Sentinel) “We saw a big gap in the whiskey market,” Bradstreet explains. “There was this huge influx of product, but consumers don’t really know what anything is. And what we saw was that 70 percent of these brands were coming from four giant distilleries.” It’s not a secret, they tell me, but it’s not largely talked about. “These big names are buying from behemoth distilleries and spending millions in branding, but it’s not their whiskey.” In fact, some of it is the exact same whiskey , sold with different labels and at different price points. “And there was no love for the smaller guys,” Buffa notes. “You had to really hustle if you were a small, independent distillery, especially here in Florida, which is the second largest whiskey market in the U.S.” Compass Box, Bradstreet explains, is completely transparent, focusing on different regions of Scotland and creating unique blends by bringing them together. “What if we did that with American distilleries?” they wondered. And so they did. Barrels filled with liquors are used to produce the unique blend of offerings at Forward Slash Distillery & Blending House in Winter Park, Fla.. (Willie J. Allen Jr./Orlando Sentinel) Forward/Slash works with small, independent distilleries and farmers. They choose carefully. They blend meticulously. They keep nerd-level notes. And they let all their fellow nerds in on the process. “We tell our customers everything,” says Bradstreet. “The distillers, the coopers, the mash bills, everything . Complete data dump.” Visitors to Forward/Slash can see the percentages of each whiskey in the blend. They can go even deeper and taste each element by itself if they want. It’s a theme park for nano-level enjoyment. But it’s also a killer bar with great cocktails. Because most people don’t really care. They chuckle at the observation’s accuracy. “Most of our customers just want a good quality beverage served to them with a smile,” says Buffa. “But the niche customers love [the details]. It’s mind-blowing.” Co-owner and whiskey maker Tim Bradstreet prepares a Peach Julep, the featured cocktail for Saturday's Kentucky Derby party at Forward/Slash Distillery & Blending House in Winter Park. (Willie J. Allen Jr./Orlando Sentinel) Forward/Slash doesn’t make the whiskey they bottle and serve. They blend it. But they do distill bitters and liqueurs utilizing Florida agriculture at their Winter Park venue, which, depending on the day, is both cozy and expansive. A warm little bar up front speaks to high-level sampling in chill confines. For events, they open up the back, where another bar shares space with the still and barrels. A bar-adjacent Blending Lab is where much of the magic happens — and where parties of 2-10 can book private tastings that feature a welcome cocktail and a 90-minute experience that includes a complete tour, an in-depth discussion of the process and a curated flight of Forward/Slash spirits. It starts at $75, and since these guys are chefs of the barrel (and you can hit Michelin-starred Soseki with a rock from here), I feel fine calling it the cheapest omakase in Winter Park. Start with the Derby, though. Methinks some of you will be sparked with a desire for deeper dabbling.

The signature margarita for Sunday's Cinco de Mayo celebration at Forward/Slash Distillery & Blending House in Winter Park. (Willie J. Allen Jr./Orlando Sentinel) Sunday Cinco Celebration Derby Day should give newcomers a festive peek at the process, too, but if you can’t make it Saturday, you may want to stop in on Sunday for a Cinco de Mayo event that will feature the launch of Sin Nombre. This wild, new blended agave spirit (it smelled like pears from the barrel) will be featured in a funky crafted margarita with a consommé dusted rim courtesy of the Fui Yo Mexicana food truck, whose birria was dehydrated to make the stuff. “The whole building will be open, we’ll have a Volkswagen Beetle set up for photo-ops … it’s going to be a massive party. We’re definitely taking Monday off.” Originally Published: May 1, 2024 at 8:19 AM EDT Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Bluesky Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X RevContent Feed Most Popular Most Popular Universal nabs 5 Golden Tickets: 4 for Epic, 1 for Volcano Bay Universal nabs 5 Golden Tickets: 4 for Epic, 1 for Volcano Bay Can Orlando’s baseball dream survive after its biggest investors drop out?

Restaurants Winter Park Distillery & Blending House Slated to Open on April 1 FORWARD/SLASH will open as a first of its kind boutique distillery & blending house Published Date: March 21, 2023, 6:11 AM EDT Written By Lisa Hay News Writer Share SHARE Central Florida’s new distillery and blending house, FORWARD/SLASH will open to the public on Saturday, April 1, The commercial warehouse located at 650 S Capen Ave Winter Park, FL 32789 has been transformed from its historic 1950’s Holler building into an expansive distillery featuring spirits from across the country, hand-selected and blended in house. Incepted by ownership team, Tim Bradstreet of former downtown Orlando restaurant, Rusty Spoon, and Beverage Director for Marriott International, alongside Michael Buffa who founded both the Orlando Whiskey Society and Buffa Bittering Company, FORWARD/SLASH will offer an elevated distilled spirits experience. “We’re selecting aged American Whiskeys from all across the country from independent farmers and distillers and blending these incredible barrels here at our facility to create a truly unique product. We’re 100% transparent in who and where we source our whiskeys and other spirits from, giving the customer as much information as possible while simultaneously telling the story of the people who made the distillate. We tell their story through the art of blending. And blending is an artform, it is not easy, especially when it comes to working with different mash bills from different distilleries. You have to find that perfect balance and nuance in the blend so that each part can be highlighted and bring character to the final product. Like a musician playing an instrument in an orchestra.” said Bradstreet in a statement. The concept of blending might not be new but Buffa and Bradstreet aim to offer transparency through authenticity with each of their blends. Unlike many mass-marketed spirits, their labels will showcase a comprehensive ingredient list, aiming to tell the story of the distilleries and farmers behind them. In addition to blending, they will also be distilling artisan liqueurs and bitters utilizing Florida agriculture, highlighting the bountiful offerings from local farmers. Their beverage program will roll out at open with a menu of intentionally crafted cocktails. “We’re picking the best ingredients possible to make the best quality cocktails so we can create an experience for people – When you leave here, we want you to have an authentic cocktail bar experience and know what’s in your bottle. The products we are producing here are so delicious and so unique, we’re really excited to share them with everyone. ” said Buffa. With the passing of recent Florida legislation in 2021, distilleries like FORWARD/SLASH can now sell spirits for direct consumption as a tasting or in a cocktail in their tasting rooms. FORWARD/SLASH will open its doors at 4 p.m. on Saturday, April 1 and the celebration will continue through their normal operating hours of 11 p.m. Regular bar and tasting lounge hours will be Wednesday & Thursday from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. After opening, private tasting classes will begin as a means to offer a specialty guided experience into the world of distillation. 650 S Capen Ave, Winter Park, FL 32789 Be the First to Know From new restaurant openings to exciting retail launches and real estate insights, be the first to know what’s happening in Orlando Subscribe & Stay Ahead Share This Article Facebook Copy Link Print By Lisa Hay Follow: Lisa is a staff reporter for What Now Media Group.

The business combines production and education to offer a unique experience for whiskey lovers. Photos by: Jim Carchidi Share This: Forward/Slash Premium Blended Whiskey celebrated the grand opening of its Winter Park distillery and blending house, located at 650 S. Capen Ave., on April 1 with a menu of craft cocktails and a peek at production. The bourbon brand is the result of a process that co-owners Tim Bradstreet and Michael Buffa are happy to discuss. “We work with quality distilleries from across the country that are independently owned,” Bradstreet told the32789. “We bring their product here to begin the process of blending distillates based on their flavor characteristics to create our own product.” Forward/Slash is the result of an experiential blending that began with a friendship. Bradstreet, a former beverage operations manager for Orlando World Center Marriott and Gaylord Palms, met Buffa, founder of Buffa Bittering Company , through a mutual involvement in the Orlando Whiskey Society . Forward/Slash Premium Blended Whiskey is created and served at its 650 S. Capen Ave. building. Co-owners Michael Buffa and Tim Bradstreet offer guests a peek at the blending process (above), and conversations about production will be part of the daily routine in the tasting room (below). “I was manufacturing out of Jacksonville, but I knew I needed to have something that was based locally,” Buffa told the32789. “I was considering what I thought would be unique; come to find out that Tim had the same idea and we said, ‘why don’t we just partner up and do this?'” Their mutual industry connections gave them access to the independent distilling community; however, their opus did not reach its full potential until the 2021 passing of the Florida Craft Distilleries Law , which allows distillers to sell their products for in-house and off-site consumption. “When we started this company, we weren’t allowed to sell cocktails or pours of anything that we had distilled or blended,” said Bradstreet. “The new law immediately shifted our focus.” The Forward/Slash building dates back to 1958 and sat vacant for years before the renovation. An ongoing search for a location to blend and store required the infusion of a public space to serve their product. The 7,400 square-foot 1950’s era warehouse, formerly owned by the Holler family, was renovated into a blending lab and tasting room with ample space for storage and production that includes bitters distillation. Products are served as part of the craft cocktail menu with bottled bourbon sales also available. The tasting room offers seating for 20 with roughly the same accommodation on a covered patio. Special tastings and a demonstration of the blending process will be part of scheduled tours. Tour guests will also sample the aromas of whiskies in storage, which can require up to eight months to fully mature. The blending lab is opposite the bar area and will be part of scheduled tours. Special tastings, included with the tours, will be part of a classroom-style demonstration of the blending process. The lab stocks equally-sized samples of blending subjects that will be up-sized when a suitable combination is found. Forward/Slash also offers the first blended vodka, featuring potato and sugar based distillates, and plans to add rye and single malt whiskies to its brand later in the year. Real Good cocktail whiskey is among the Forward/Slash products used at the on-site cocktail bar. Bartender Samir Patel pours an espresso martini, which is made with the company’s blended vodka. The building also offers room for expansion. Plans to double the size of the customer space with a lounge and second bar are under consideration, but Bradstreet and Buffa are currently more focused on welcoming the public, building their clientele, and producing their product. “Every business starts with an idea, but I think the most successful businesses let that grow organically,” said Buffa. “Instead of trying to dictate what you want your customers to like, you need time to figure out who your customer base is and be able to tailor your products to them.” The tasting room is open Wednesdays and Thursdays from 4-10 p.m., and Fridays and Saturdays from 4-11 p.m. Weekday tours with private tasting classes will begin within a month, information will be posted on the Forward/Slash website .

View All Articles Life In Orlando Theme Parks Real Estate About Us Our Story Careers Menu Close Forward/Slash Distillery and Blending House By Yasmene Warren Drinking whiskey is fun, but doing so in a place that specializes in it is even more fun. Luckily, there’s just the place in Winter Park for you to experience that fun feeling on your own, and it’s called Forward/Slash. Image by Forward/Slash Distillery What is Forward/Slash? Forward/Slash is a bar that is both a distillery and blending house located in Winter Park on South Capen Avenue, and it specializes in crafting premium blended whiskeys. This place aims to tilt the whiskey industry forward through its passion in creating what the owners describe as “interesting whiskeys.” What sets American Blended Whiskey apart from traditional whiskey, according to Forward/Slash’s website, is that the former only needs to have some whiskey blended into the bottle for it to be considered blended whiskey and that the majority of it can be neutral spirit or vodka. This means, a bottle of blended whiskey could be 80% vodka. This is what sets Forward/Slash apart from other blended whiskey makers as the creators think that that’s wrong. This place only blends barrel-aged American Whiskey from only “the most passionate and talented distillers in the country.” You can see the blending in action and catch a drink or two from Forward/Slash Wednesdays and Thursdays from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Fridays and Saturdays from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. Image by Forward/Slash Distillery The Ambiance Pulling up to the Forward/Slash distillery, you’re met with a black garage door and a full view of where the blending happens. As you make your way into the entrance, you’ll walk through a cozy outdoor seating area and into the bar where the lights are dim and warm, and the decor screams “classy!” Greenery sits atop the very high-up window sill, and the walls are lined with wooden decor. Have a seat at the bar and learn how the masters themselves make magic happen with the drinks they serve! What to Do and Drink Because Forward/Slash is more than just any old bar, there’s a bit more to do here. Its tasting room hours are the same as its hours of operation, and you can drop in for a tasting experience or even have this place host an event for you. Image by Forward/Slash Distillery You can also book a private whiskey tasting online with Forward/Slash and receive a tasting room tour, see in-depth the whiskey blending process, sample some products and do so with the company co-founders themselves for 90 minutes! Right now, you can order half and full ounce pours of bourbon such as singular selections like MB Roland and Filibuster, as well as singular reserves like Journeyman, Breuckelen and Manifest. You can also order a bourbon flight, a rye flight or a single malt flight. As for the full-service cocktail bar, the menu is constantly changing and having new, unique creations added to it. You can order the “1st Drink on the Menu” — yes, that’s literally what it’s called — which is a vodka soda with a Florida citrus blend. There’s also the Gothic Revival, which has bourbon, acid corrected blood orange, strawberry, cinnamon, balsamic and mint. Forward/Slash also serves a variety of other cocktails like a traditional old fashioned, a gin and tonic, and an espresso martini. There are plenty of other options, and they’re always changing, so stop in and try them for yourself! Overall This isn’t just some ordinary bar as it has a lot more to offer. Whether you’re booking a tour, having a blended whiskey tasting, or simply just in the mood for a good drink, Forward/Slash will leave you satisfied! Winter Park Winter Park is a booming city in Orange County located just minutes outside of greater Orlando . It’s filled with rich history, art, small businesses and a whole lot of local restaurants and bars.
