Anoshua Chaudhuri, PhD Senior Director of CEETL and Lam-Larsen Distinguished Professor of Economics at San Francisco State University Anoshua Chaudhuri served the RAMS Board for 17 impactful years. Anoshua brought her professional expertise as a health economist and her passion for teaching which helped the organization navigate through a tumultuous economic time during the 2008 housing crisis and recession. Since then she has played a critical role in the advancement of the organization. Her support and encouragement is tangible, motivating staff as RAMS has grown exponentially over the last several years. While she has stepped down from her Board role, we know her commitment will continue to the organization and working to better the lives of her fellow San Franciscans and neighbors.
