In fact, the area began as a stable and over the years had evolved into a blacksmith shop, a general store and a saloon. Our logo, inclusive of a horse, is a hat tip to our historic roots here in Monkton. Today, it’s a country oasis in the heart of steeplechase land where friends and family gather for delectable food and exquisite service. Like our history here in Maryland, our patrons are loyal and longstanding. We value the relationships we have cultivated with all of you year after year. FARM-TO-TABLE At the Manor Tavern, taste is everything. Our grounds allow us to control all aspects of the growing process from our farm to your table. We are always open to suggestions so share with us any specific herbs or produce you’d like to see in our garden. Optimal Freshness Our produce is generally harvested when we need it. When a fruit or vegetable is given the time to completely ripen, it fully develops and retains its vitamins and minerals, giving it a more vibrant flavor and maximizing the nutritional content. Our large variety of items have a longer time to ripen “on the vine” ultimately eliminating travel time and processing and optimizing the taste and texture of our food. Community Each item that we grow has its own unique story. Growing and buying locally means you are supporting the family farmers and ranchers that raised your food. Connecting to the sources is a very meaningful part of the overall experience. Our selection of available produce changes weekly, dependent upon what is readily available in our area. This allows us to deliver items when they are at their peak, are most abundant, and in the case of farmers markets, least expensive.

It is a tavern but from the moment we walked in, the staff and owners made us feel very welcomed. The owners son had a birthday that day and gave us some extra cake and it was the best birthday cake we ever had. Atmosphere and people make the experience of places and this was one of the highlights of our weekend. Highly recommend your family stops by! review by - Yelp Taneesha H: I stumbled across this bar and since they're open late I decided to give them a try. The service was A1, the food was great and came out fast and the ladies restroom was exceptionally clean which is a plus. I ordered the cheese fries and wings which I would get again. I didn't get a drink here but there were a few regulars at the bar drinking so I'm sure the drinks are good review by - Yelp Abby B: Just went for drinks on a Saturday night. Very laid back vibe, with incredibly friendly wait staff that was attentive and fast. Glasses were kept filled. The prices are very reasonable, and cheaper than what I see in most parts of Dallas, which was amazing. Great place for a chill night of drinks. review by - Yelp Matt W: This location is such a hidden gem downtown! My friends and I were walking downtown looking for something \"new\" to try out and decided to go into this dark tavern. The environment was pretty neat. When you walk in, it is an area that looks like an old country bar. Then there are pictures of what the bar used to look like. There's vintage stools and benches to sit on. Although it's a small area, it is sure not a place to skip out on. Johnny Cash on the wall, and sports playing on the TV... review by - Yelp Lauren R: I have been coming to this bar for over 4 years, ever since I moved downtown. I met my husband here. I met some of my closest friends here. This place has a special place in my heart. Every time my husband and I travel, we go home to drop off our bags (We don't set a single step inside) and walk straight to Tavern. Its good drinks, good food, and the best family that make City Tavern a home away from home.

About TRG At the heart of any successful restaurant, is a team of passionate people. Nick Sanders founded Tavern Restaurant Group with deSha’s Maysville, KY in 1981,  followed by deSha’s American Tavern Cincinnati in 1990. After several trips to the UK, Nick decided to model his next concepts off of the warmth and hospitality he found in public houses throughout Europe.  This led to the opening of Nicholson’s in 1997 and The Pub Rookwood in 2001. The Tavern Group currently operates all of its original concepts, plus The Backstage Event Center, and an additional seven Pubs in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida. Award-Winning Concepts Voted Best Fish and Chips in the U.S. Founder and CEO of Tavern Restaurant Group, Nick Sander s, has been building innovative and authentic bars and restaurants for over 45 years, including: deSha’s, Nicholson’s, The Pub, Horse and Barrel, and The Backstage Event Center. Nick was inspired to design these concepts out of the culture and hospitality he discovered during his travels throughout the United Kingdom. He is a native of Lexington, KY, a UK alum, and longtime resident of Cincinnati, OH. Nick Sanders Owner & Founder Meet Me at deSha’s deSha’s Maysville is a family restaurant named for Nick’s father, deSha Sanders. It has been a community favorite since opening in 1981, offering unique dining experience with steaks, seafood, pasta, and regional favorites not found anywhere else. In the summer of 1990, following the success of deSha’s Maysville, Nick opened the doors to deSha’s Cincinnati. Since then, they’ve been on a mission to be a comfortable, down-home place to get authentic food and drink. A lot has changed over the years, but the most important things have stayed the same for both deSha’s restaurants: an unwavering dedication to warm hospitality, top-notch tavern fare, and carefully selected beer, wine, and spirits. deSha's Maysville deSha's Cincinnati A Brit About The Pub The Pub offers a unique British Pub experience complete with brilliant food, drink, and genuine hospitality.
