Shortly thereafter, she opened the critically-acclaimed Sorella, a beloved Italian restaurant in the Lower East Side which she owned and operated for the next six years. Soon after its closing, she held top positions in some of New York City's finest restaurants, such as The Restaurant at The NoMad Hotel, Shuko, and Uchu. After opening L'itos, a sandwich pop-up in Chinatown, in 2020, she joined the Boka Restaurant Group in 2021 as Director of Operations of Food and Beverage at The Hoxton Williamsburg.
