We're seeking five new trustees from diverse backgrounds. Please apply by 13 October 2025. Join The Board LCC’s Trustees provide vital oversight – the ten-strong Board help keep the organisation on track and make sure the charity stays in the very best shape possible. About The Trustees The Board of Trustees ensure LCC’s CEO and staff team are working in the most effective way towards our campaigning and strategic goals. Trustees hold responsibility for making sure LCC meets its legal obligations, ensuring its finances are well-managed, making sure governance structures are functioning well, and overseeing the charity’s internal democracy. Members of the Board sit on committees (Business Committee, Campaigns & Active Membership, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the Nominations Committee). Trustees are expected to attend regular Board meetings – usually about six a year plus the AGM – and occasional board away days. Trustees are also encouraged to participate in one or more of the committees or working groups according to their own interests. Being a charity trustee is a great way to skill up in leadership, governance and collective decision-making. You oversee all manner of activities, from safeguarding to equality work. And you help shape the future of cycling, and our city, for the better. We are actively seeking trustees from diverse backgrounds to help shape a charity board that reflects the communities we serve and fosters inclusive decision-making. If you would like to find out more about being a trustee (no previous experience of being a trustee is necessary) please have a read of this blog from our current Vice Chair Eilidh Murray. You are welcome to email agm@lcc.org.uk for an informal conversation with current members of the board at any point. Join The Board We’re actively seeking trustees from diverse backgrounds to help shape a charity board that reflects the communities we serve and fosters inclusive decision-making. Find Out More Nomination Form We’re actively seeking trustees from diverse backgrounds to help shape a charity board that reflects the communities we serve and fosters inclusive decision-making. Become A Trustee There are five vacancies in this year’s election to the LCC Board. Those elected will serve for three years between the 2025 and 2028 AGMs. If you’re passionate about cycling in London, we encourage you to complete and return a nomination form. You’ll need two fellow LCC members to nominate you, but if that feels like a barrier please email agm@lcc.org.uk and we’ll support you. Candidates are asked to provide a supporting statement of up to 500 words. You can see examples from previous candidates here . We’re especially keen to hear from you if you’ve never thought of yourself as a ‘typical’ board member. LCC is committed to becoming a more inclusive organisation, and we’re particularly keen to receive nominations from people from backgrounds currently underrepresented in cycling and on our Board—including London’s diverse communities. No previous board or trustee experience is required—just your commitment and perspective. Completed Nomination Forms must be returned to the LCC office by 9.00am Monday 13 October 2025. Full details of how to do so are on the form. Want to chat before applying? We know that standing for the Board can feel like a big step, so if you’d like to find out more before deciding, please have a read of this blog from our current Vice Chair Eilidh Murray, or email agm@lcc.org.uk and one of our trustees will contact you for an informal chat. Download Nomination Form Close Giulio Ferrini Chair In my professional life, I work for Sustrans, the national walking and cycling charity. I have delivered dozens of low traffic neighbourhoods and cycle routes across the UK, as well as writing new design guidance. I work closely with Transport for London and have been working part time for the new government agency Active Travel England. I therefore have direct experience of working with trustees from the staff side and understand how important they are in shaping the strategic direction of a cycling charity. Equality, diversity and inclusion is one of my main priorities. As a trustee I use my voice to amplify others and challenge those (who often look like me) opposed to change, so that everyone can see cycling as the quickest, fastest and cheapest way to get from A to B, just like I always have. Close Simon Clark Treasurer I am a chartered accountant by training, and have lived and cycled in London all my life. I am the London Cycling Campaign’s Treasurer, and also the Chair of LCC’s Business Committee. From starting out cycling to school, to seeing the decline and subsequent resurgence of cycling, I have seen how getting around London by bike has been transformed. It is now so much easier to use bikes on a casual basis to get around. However, there is still much to do. We should aim to ensure that everyone travelling in London feels that choosing to travel by bike is a “normal” and safe option. Increasing the take up of cycling as a form of transport is vital for the health of our city. Close Colin Crooks MBE Trustee We are at a tipping point in social willingness to try cycling with 22% of Londoners now “actively considering” getting on a bike. If this happened, we would see more than half of Londoners on their bike. To start with we need to fully understand the key barriers to starting, whether they be physical, emotional or financial. Then, we need to work in partnership with others in the community to devise and deliver schemes which address these barriers and steadily remove them. Higher levels of cycling are crucial to our adaptation to a net zero way of life. Close Dr Nedah Darabi Trustee Making roads safer is a public health issue. My background is working as a GP in the NHS, and it is my role to promote a healthy environment for the community. I have previously worked with Lambeth Council to promote better accessibility to active travel through their pioneering ‘Kerbside Strategy’. In 2022, whilst cycling to work I was hit by a lorry driver, I was seriously injured and my right leg was amputated. I’m part of a community of cyclists who have sustained life-changing injuries, and the circumstances that led to the collisions we were involved in are depressingly similar; dangerous junctions, HGVs that don’t allow good visibility, lack of adequate cycling infrastructure and training around sharing roads with ‘vulnerable road users’ in London. In addition, there is often a lack of justice for victims in a system that fails to protect cyclists. All issues that the LCC has and continues to campaign for. In a time where cycling is often used as a political football, I hope to humanise the issue of road safety and remind people that real lives are at stake. Close Sara Dowling Trustee I bring over 30 years’ experience working in the charity sector. I am currently the Deputy CEO and Director of Operations at RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims. I’ve lived in Lambeth since the early 90s and I love the benefits and freedoms that cycling brings. For me, cycling is the solution to many of society’s challenges, from public health, the climate crisis, air quality, inclusion, and the cost-of living crisis, as well as a joyous and empowering activity that improves our quality of life. Close Toby Hopkins Trustee I am a long-time member of LCC, borough co-ordinator for LCC’s Wandsworth group, and co-founder of LCC’s Cycle Buddies programme to enable people to buddy up with another person cycling in their area for support. As a trustee I draw on my passion for cycling activism and community engagement – and my extensive background in business and governance. I bring vision, commitment to inclusivity and diversity, and a proven record of financial competence and effective management. Close Eilidh Murray Trustee I’ve been a member of LCC for 16 years and a trustee for four. The climate crisis needs urgent action at local, national and international levels but the pace of change just isn’t fast enough. Cycling is a key component of the climate emergency tool box. Getting more people on bikes and enabling them to cycle safely is a no-brainer. I want to see children cycling safely, women confident on their bikes and many currently under-represented communities enjoying the freedom enabled by that game-changing invention of 1817, the bicycle. Close Izzy Romilly Trustee I’m Izzy, I’m 27, and I live in Lambeth (in a first-floor flat on an A-road, which is a daily reminder of how far we have to go). I’ve been cycling around south London since I was about 5. Since becoming an LCC member, I’ve attended protests, taken direct action, learnt about the debates and dynamics around cycling, and have become a passionate believer in a liveable future for London. As a trustee, I bring empathy and solidarity with those demanding change, as well as those who could never see themselves cycling here. I’m keen to see more constructive and empathetic conversations around cycling infrastructure. I know there are a wide range of attitudes towards cycling in London, and I’m keen to engage beyond the in-crowd.
