Spend enjoyable evenings at our multiple programs virtually. Thank you for your continued support. West Indian American Day Carnival Association Organization Profile Ms. Jessie Wardell and some of her West Indian friends started the Carnival in Harlem in the 1930â²s by staging costume parties in large enclosed places â like the Savoy, Renaissance and Audubon \t\t\t\t\t\tBallrooms due to the cold wintry weather of February. This is the usual time for the pre-Lenten celebrations held in most countries around the world. However, because of the very nature of Carnival and the \t\t\t\tneed to parade in costume to music â in door confinement did not work. The earliest known Carnival street activity was held during the 1940â²s when Ms. Wardell, secured the first street permit for a parade type event on the streets of Harlem. During the 1960â²s, another \t\t\t\t\tTrinidadian â Rufus Goring, brought Carnival to Brooklyn. In 1967, Goring passed the reigns over to Carlos Lezama, who became president of WIADCA and who nurtured the organization and carnival celebrations \t\t\t\ttill 2001, when, due to his ill-health he retired and his daughter, Yolanda Lezama-Clark served as president till 2011. Thomas Bailey was elected president in 2012. All lived in Trinidad & Tobago during \t\t\t\t\ttheir early lives.
