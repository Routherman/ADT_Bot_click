Location Mid-Park between 71st and 78th Restrooms No restrooms Share: Share on Twitter Share by Email Share on Facebook This 20-acre water body connects the Ramble , Bethesda Terrace , and various west side landscapes to form what is often called the heart of Central Park. In addition to wandering its varied shoreline and appreciating its many vistas, visitors can also explore the Lake by boat thanks to rowboat rentals available at the Central Park Boathouse . Central Park’s designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux envisioned the Lake as a key to fulfilling the Park’s primary purpose—providing a sense of wonder and escape from urban life. The Lake’s bridges and small structures, known as boat landings, are focal points, enticing visitors to explore further and enjoy the views. Then & Now: The Lake View with audio description The Lake was the first landscape in Central Park to be opened to the public in winter 1858. New Yorkers were drawn by the promise of ice skating, a recreational activity that was growing in popularity but not yet widely accessible. On Christmas morning that year, an estimated 8,000 people showed up to skate on the newly opened Lake. Boating was first made available in the 1860s and became widely popular. Quiet Moments at the Lake Enjoy this sunset view of the Lake, a gorgeous water body in the heart of Central Park. View with audio description The Central Park Conservancy completed a major four-year restoration of the Lake in 2010 to stabilize the shoreline, enhance the landscape with new plantings, rebuild infrastructure, and improve the overall ecological health of the area.

We are passionate about our local parks, our city trees, and other shared community resources. We believe that healthy parks help grow healthy communities. We believe that our community forest not only makes our neighborhoods beautiful places to live, but provides critical functions to the health, well-being, and sustainability of urban life. And we believe that all Denver residents should have access to these critical urban resources. We work towards our mission by raising private funds for capital improvement projects of various sizes and through several ongoing programs: Denver Digs Trees , Community Forester , Mile High Tree Champions , TreeForce , and Park Legacy . We are Denver's oldest and primary city-wide park advocacy group and longest-standing tree organization. We have infused tens of millions of dollars into the city's public spaces, and we have planted more than 60,000 trees in Denver. Learn more about What We Do . Our History The Park People was created in 1969 by a small group of park enthusiasts who banded together to raise private funds to support Denver's extensive parks and recreation system. We are a separate entity from Denver's Department of Parks and Recreation, but have worked in close partnership with the department since our founding. In our 50+-year history, The Park People has infused many millions of dollars into Denver's parks through the restoration of existing park infrastructure, such as fountains and historic park buildings, and through new construction, such as playgrounds and recreation facilities. Our projects include sites in Denver's highest profile parks like the Washington Park Boat House, Cheesman Park Pavilion, Civic Center Esplanade, and City Park fountains. We also value the city's lesser known community treasures, such as the beloved Sundial & Plaza in Cranmer Park, the historic James Fleming House in Platt Park, and the award-winning Gates Tennis Center in Cherry Creek. And we look for high-need projects, such as playground builds in neighborhoods that lack access to recreation resources. Learn about our Capital Projects . The Park People is best known as the home of Denver Digs Trees , a beloved, city-wide tree distribution program founded in 1991. The program's roots grow from the initiative of a small group of neighbors in West Wash Park who organized around kitchen tables to bring affordable trees to plant throughout their neighborhood in the 1980's. These scrappy neighbors distributed 50 trees out of residents' garages their first year. Their initiative expanded in scope and was adopted by The Park People in response to a city-wide need for affordable trees. Denver Digs Trees has since become a cherished community tradition, known throughout the city as a provider of carefully selected tree species appropriate for our arid climate and urban environment. We are proud to provide affordable trees to residents in all of Denver's neighborhoods and place particular emphasis on distributing trees in under-canopied neighborhoods. Since 1991, Denver Digs Trees has distributed more than 60,000 trees to Denver residents. Learn more about Denver Digs Trees and our other urban forestry programs . Support for The Park People comes from individual donations, program fees, foundation and government grants, and corporate sponsorships. The Park People is managed and executed by a small staff, a dedicated Board of Trustees, and many hundreds of volunteers each year. Find out how you can Get Involved and how you can Contribute .

The beacon went live Tuesday, February 10, as part of ongoing improvements along the State Road 426/County Road 419 corridor. This innovative safety feature has been installed to provide a secure crossing option for pedestrians, particularly students, navigating this busy stretch of road during school hours and beyond. The Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon, designed and installed by FDOT, functions similarly to a traffic signal but remains inactive until a pedestrian activates it. This cutting-edge safety solution has already proven effective across Central Florida in helping pedestrians safely cross high-traffic areas. How It Works Activation : Pedestrians press a button on the roadside pole to activate the beacon. Flashing Yellow : The beacon begins with a flashing yellow light to alert drivers. Steady Yellow : The signal transitions to a steady yellow, indicating drivers should prepare to stop. Steady Red : The light turns solid red, requiring drivers to stop, while pedestrians see a WALK signal to cross safely. Flashing Red : After the WALK phase, the pedestrian signal switches to a flashing DON’T WALK . During this phase, drivers see alternating flashing red lights, signaling them to stop, yield to pedestrians, and proceed only when the crosswalk is clear. Media Availability FDOT and the City of Oviedo will have media availability on Wednesday, February 12 at 7:00 a.m. District 5 Safety Administrator Loreen Bobo and an officer from the Oviedo Police Department will be present to assist kids crossing to Oviedo High School and to demonstrate the beacon's operation and educate students on its use.

As temperatures start to climb in Central Florida, Oviedo Public Safety officials want to remind all residents to never leave children or pets unattended in a vehicle, even if it is just for a few minutes. Every summer, tragic incidents occur when children or animals are left inside locked cars, where temperatures can rise dangerously fast, even with the windows cracked. In just 10 minutes, the temperature inside a vehicle can climb by 20 degrees. On a 90-degree day, that can mean deadly heat levels in less time than it takes to run a quick errand. Parents of small children and animal owners should always take the time to Stop, Look and Lock. Stop the car and make it a point to turn around, look, and make sure the back seat is clear. If at home, always lock the car to ensure children playing cannot get inside and accidentally lock themselves inside the vehicle. “School is ending and people’s routines may be changing,” said Oviedo Police Chief Dale Coleman. “It may be easier to forget the kids are in the car while running errands or going to work. We want to make sure everyone remains safe in the heat.” Some quick facts about heat: · Heatstroke is a leading cause of non-crash vehicle-related deaths in children. · A child’s body temperature rises three to five times faster than an adult’s. · Pets can suffer organ damage or death from heat exposure in a matter of minutes. “It’s imperative to call 9-1-1 if you see a child or pet in distress if they are in a locked vehicle,” said Oviedo Fire Chief Michael Woodward. “The faster a firefighter or police officer can get to the child/pet, the better chances they have to survive.” Anyone who sees a child or pet locked in a car without a parent or guardian in proximity can call 9-1-1 for help. It is a 2 nd degree felony in the State of Florida to leave a child under the age of 6 in a locked vehicle for longer than 15 minutes. ### 5-22 Memorial Day FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 22, 2024 CONTACT: Lisa McDonald, Communications Manager City of Oviedo 407-971-5509 lmcdonald@CityofOviedo.net City Offices Closed to Observe Memorial Day Oviedo, Fla. – City of Oviedo government offices will be closed on Monday, May 26, 2025, to observe Memorial Day.   Offices will re-open on Tuesday, May 27, 2025 at 8 a.m. On Monday, May 26, 2025, there will be a sunset Memorial Day Ceremony at the Veterans Tribute, located at Center Lake Park (299 Center Lake Lane).

The program, created by the Public Works Stormwater Division, was an initiative within the Community Rating System guided by FEMA (more on the program can be found under the stormwater web page). The city saw a way to combine the basic idea of outlining what habitats could potentially be within the floodplains and take it a step further and involve city residents and visitors to the local trails and parks by observing wildlife in its natural habitat. The program is interactive and provides the ability to send pictures of wildlife spotted and pinpoint locations to track the various species in the city. Wildlife Whereabouts is an exciting new citizen science initiative that encourages residents to explore the outdoors and contribute to wildlife conservation.  Citizens can use the online, interactive map to see not only what type of rare or endangered wildlife they could be viewing, but can also see more common species of local interest and where wildlife can be found. The city houses several bird species such as bald eagles, sandhill cranes and owls. In addition, other species such as otters, alligators, deer, snakes, turtles and many more are also part of the city’s ecosystem, along with valuable native plants that help the local wildlife thrive. The full list can be found here: cityofoviedo.net/1203/Stormwater Wildlife Whereabouts will be a fun summer activity for families that will educate them about species and their habitats. Residents can use the online form to fill out where they found the species on the map and upload their pictures with a photo credit displaying the photographer’s name.  The online form can be used on cellphones, laptops and desktops and can be found in the link listed above.  There is also a direct link on the City’s homepage in the “City News” section. “This is a fantastic opportunity to keep kids engaged over the summer while supporting environmental education and wildlife conservation,” said Floodplain Administrator Amanda Kortus. “We hope to inspire a greater appreciation for nature right here in our own backyards.” SAFETY FIRST Anyone wishing to participate and submit a form is asked to observe the rules and Florida State laws when it comes to wildlife. Keep a safe distance from all wildlife, especially dangerous species such as alligators, snakes and bears. Do not feed the wildlife to get a good picture. That is against the law. Keep children at a safe distance. Do not disturb nests or offspring. Observe, don’t interact. The city wants to inspire young biologists, nature lovers and photographers to explore and reconnect with nature through this ongoing program. ### Tab Name 6-5 Art in the Chambers FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: June 5, 2025 CONTACT: Lisa McDonald, Communications Manager City of Oviedo 407-971-5509 lmcdonald@CityofOviedo.net City of Oviedo Opens Second “Art in the Chambers” Exhibition Featuring Local Artist Wonda Granville Oviedo, Fla. – In May, the Oviedo City Council and the Oviedo Public Arts Board proudly opened the second installment of the “ Art in the Chambers” exhibition, featuring a collection of charcoal drawings by local artist Wonda Granville.

The road was reconstructed with a reinforced box culvert designed to withstand higher floodwaters and better manage storm runoff. “We spent a significant amount of time redesigning this area in case another 100-year storm like Ian comes through,” said Assistant City Engineer Paul Yeargain. “The City and our residents are happy to see the end of this project and for Alafaya Woods to regain that sense of normalcy.” The area is now fully operational and open to both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

Now it’s back on the streets with a fun and fresh design, ready to help educate our community.” The Otter Box will once again serve as a mobile educational display at events promoting awareness about how stormwater systems work and why protecting local waterways is so important. The otter was chosen because they have been seen in Sweetwater Creek, Live Oak and the Little Econ River, making them the perfect, adorable mascot for stormwater. In addition, Public Works wants to promote the Wildlife Whereabouts programs, where residents and visitors can take pictures and report where they have seen local wildlife. Keep an eye out for the Otter Box around town—and remember, protecting our stormwater system helps protect our local wildlife.

Solary Park is located in the Oviedo Historic Downtown Area at the corner of Franklin Street and Geneva Drive.  The Park provides amenities, boardwalks, rain gardens, littoral zones, and Florida-Friendly Landscaping TM .  It also provides direct access to the Florida National Scenic Trail, better known as the Florida Trail. Display boards are located throughout the Park that provide educational information on the environmental benefits of conservation areas, watersheds, and the benefits of preserving natural floodplains. See slideshow for more info. Solary Park includes an enhanced stormwater management system allowing development of the historic commercial district by allowing local business owners to utilize capacity to convey and treat the drainage from their properties via the stormwater management system. The project is essential to facilitate and provide incentive for development and redevelopment in the Historic Downtown Area. Solary Park 239 Geneva Drive Oviedo, FL 32765 Solary Park Parking Lot 161 E. Franklin Street Oviedo, FL 32765 Learn more about Solary Park below! VEGETATION AT SOLARY PARK Some of the native plantings used in Solary Park are American Beautyberry (this is the logo on Oviedo on the Park signage) Fire Bush Virginia Sweetspire Sand Cordgrass Pink Muhly Pickerel Weed Blu Flag Iris Yellow Canna Dwarf Walters Viburnum Jointed Spikerush Slash Pine Florida Flame Red Maple Sweet Bay Magnolia NATIVES OF FLORIDA These plants have naturally thrived the hot wet summers and the cool dry winters in Florida for thousands of years. Sandy soils suit them perfectly and insects and animals keep them in balance so they do not overrun spaces. When you plant native plants you are helping to balance the food web of nature, birds, butterflies, and bees all help the ecosystem to thrive. Ecosystems that thrive provide us with greater recreational and educational opportunities, cleaner water bodies, and a more transparent carbon footprint. Native plants do not require excessive watering or feeding. If you have reclaimed water you do not need to apply fertilizer as there are sufficient nutrients in the water If you do use a fertilizer use a slow-release and take note of the restriction of use in the summer months. INVASIVE PLANTS Many people plant invasive plants in their yards without even knowing. Invasive species will grow wild and stifle other valuable native plantings. One of the most common invasive species found in our conservation areas and wetlands is the air potato vine. The air potato vine was introduced to Florida around 1905 and is one of the most aggressive vines and will quickly smother and even kill trees and plants it attaches to. Volunteers in Seminole County get together to conduct an air potato raid, where vines are hand-pulled and disposed of correctly to protect surrounding vegetation and wildlife. Visit the Florida-Friendly Landscaping  website at https://ffl.ifas.ufl.edu/ for more information. RAIN GARDENS Rain Gardens help eliminate harmful pollutants from reaching our storm systems and waterways. For more information on creating your own rain garden and for selecting the right plantings visit the Florida Friendly Landscaping TM program, an extension program of the University of Florida. For assistance in garden layout and planting ideas email mastergardener@seminolecountyfl.gov . KEEPING LITTER OUT - THE LITTORAL SHELF A littoral shelf is an area between the body of water and the banks surrounding it. When planted, it can create a nice border around the water and add to both the function and beauty of the area. Using native plantings around perimeters of ponds in a littoral shelf forms a barrier of protection for the water, reduces surface litter, provides shelter and food for wildlife and birds, and helps stop erosion from occurring. Oviedo strives to balance growth with environmental harmony. This is achieved by higher regulatory codes such as native tree planting requirements, strict setback rules, and floodplain management. The purchasing of land for open space is a reflection of the City’s commitment. There are currently 2,950 acres of conservation, wetlands, and open space in the city. Remember: All city drains lead to surface waters, ditches, or lakes Anything other than rain entering the system will create pollution. To report illicit dumping please contact the Public Works Department at (407) 971-5682. THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING OUR WATERWAYS!
