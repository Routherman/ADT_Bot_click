Our founder and Chairman, Geoffrey Harrison, believes the best meals are both delicious and nutritious, and ingredients should come from trusted sources. It’s a vision shared by all at Harrison because we believe ‘food with thought’ makes for excellent mealtimes! Our management team A unique and talented bunch Geoffrey Harrison Chairman Geoffrey Harrison Chairman LinkedIn Geoffrey Harrison, a lifelong food enthusiast, began his culinary career as a professional chef before establishing his own catering business, Harrison Catering Services, in 1994. His hands-on expertise in high-quality food and extensive experience in business operations and development equipped him with the knowledge and skills needed to build a thriving business. Geoffrey has received widespread recognition in the business, industry, and education sectors, earning multiple awards and accolades. Most recently, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the Chartered Institution for Further Education in 2024, adding to his Honorary Doctorate from the University of West London International Business School in 2012 and fellowships from the International Institute of Hotel Management in 2022 and the City & Guilds of London Institute in 2017. He was also honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Food Service Management (FSM) in 2019, a Catering Lifetime Achievement Award at the Cost Sector Catering Awards in 2015, and received a Special Award at the EDUcatering Excellence Awards in 2014, was named Food Service Caterer of the Year at the Catey Awards in 2010, and was a finalist for the Entrepreneur of the Year award at Ernst & Young in 2012. Harrison Catering will continue to expand with its commitment to providing delicious, healthier catering. × Gareth Harrison Joint Managing Director Gareth Harrison Joint Managing Director Gareth inherited his father’s devotion to great food and followed that enthusiasm throughout his career. He worked as a commercial chef at some of the most reputable restaurants in Berkshire and Lancashire before joining Harrison Catering Services in 1998. Since joining us, Gareth’s work has covered much of the Harrison spectrum. He has worked as our Executive Chef, Manager Client Services and Food Development and Procurement Manager. In 2006 both Gareth and his sister, Claire, were appointed to the board, with Gareth taking up the mantle of Director of Group Business. In 2010 he was made Director Client Services until 2012 when he became Joint Managing Director, along with Claire. × Claire Aylward Joint Managing Director Claire Aylward Joint Managing Director LinkedIn Claire is a born manager and, previous to working at Harrison, held several managerial roles in leading business and government organisations. She has a wealth of knowledge and experience in education and the catering industry. In 1995, just one year after it formed, Claire joined Harrison Catering and has been an integral part of the company ever since, bringing with her valuable experience in management and business. She immediately found herself at home working in education and industry operations and was appointed to the Board and a Directorship in 2006 along with her brother, Gareth. Claire excelled as Sales and Marketing Director until 2012, when she and Gareth became Joint Managing Directors. × Mark Stower Director of Food & Service Mark Stower Director of Food & Service Mark acts as the mentor to our talented chefs, establishing and maintaining the exceptionally high standards Harrison deliver daily. When training to become a chef, Mark was tutored by the Roux brothers at Le Gavroche and eventually started cooking for the directors of Shell UK and HSBC. He later became Head Chef at the Industrial Bank of Japan, where he would concoct Michelin-star standard fine dining and Japanese cuisine. During a stint as Executive Head Chef at the Financial Services Authority, Mark was responsible for the development and management of large-scale catering. This included a food court for over 2,000 employees, 46 meeting rooms and a directors’ kitchen serving eight private dining rooms. We’re very proud to have Mark on our team, bringing with him his outstanding cooking and managerial expertise. × Richard Harrison Finance Director Richard Harrison Finance Director Richard has worked in senior financial positions within several industries. Having started out in the automotive industry, he has also been a key financial figure in both blue chip PLCs and private businesses. He would go on to board-level positions with an automotive components manufacturer and then a medical services business before joining Harrison Catering. He’s been Finance Director of Harrison since 2006 and a key member of the company ever since. Despite what you might reasonably assume, Richard isn’t related to Geoffrey Harrison and refers to the likeness in their surnames as a ‘happy coincidence’. Either way, he’s a part of the Harrison Catering family now! × Passionate and skilled chefs Harrison is proud to employ a team of dedicated and enthusiastic chefs, all of whom share the company passion for fresh-cooked, delicious food full of the good stuff to keep you healthy. They have a passion for food like no one else; to make creative, trustworthy dishes to delight your senses. Harrison is always on the lookout for new talent that shares our beliefs. If you’re dedicated to bringing excellent service and high-quality food to hungry people, then let us know! We’d be very interested in hearing from you. Join us Our awards and accreditations The proof of the pudding is in the eating Our responsibility When you’re as passionate about catering and nutrition as we are, you’ll want to share that passion with others.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Abigail Abesamis Demarest is a writer who covers food and drink. Follow Author Aug 27, 2022, 03:03pm EDT Share Save Comment This article is more than 3 years old. Harrison’s Kitchen & Bar. Credit: The St. Joe Company There’s a new restaurant in Downtown Panama City’s Waterfront District, and it’s already the talk of the town. Harrison’s Kitchen & Bar is serving up traditional Southern flavors and fresh Gulf seafood in a laid-back setting. The opening of Harrison’s and the forthcoming Hotel Indigo (located just next door) is part of the revitalization that is happening in a historic downtown that was hit hard by a powerful storm, Hurricane Michael, in 2018. Southern Pimento. Credit: The St. Joe Company The local community has been involved with the restaurant even before it officially opened its doors this month. In 2021 The St. Joe Company, which manages the property, asked locals to nominate and vote on potential names for the new restaurant. The winning name, Harrison’s, references an early name for the town and Harrison Avenue, Downtown Panama City’s main drag and the street the restaurant sits at the end of. The design of the restaurant, with its wood accents and industrial vibe, is a nod to the history of the Panama City Marina and its crucial role in the downtown community. Outdoor seating area. Credit: The St. Joe Company “A city’s downtown is part of its history and its lifeblood,” Matt Moore, director of concepts and development for The St. Joe Company, said. “We think it’s fitting not only that the name chosen represents this area’s heritage, but also that the people of Panama City and Bay County helped to choose it. We want to create an anchor business that assists in the revitalization of Downtown Panama City, but just as importantly, we hope Harrison’s will be a place where people come to relax, to enjoy good food, to meet friends and make memories.” MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best Travel Insurance Companies By Amy Danise Editor Best Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans By Amy Danise Editor Parmesan Shrimp Penne Credit: The St. Joe Company Sweeping views overlooking the Panama City Marina and St. Andrews Bay offer a stunning backdrop to Harrison’s food and drink offerings. To eat, there’s gumbo, The Georgian salad (featuring mixed lettuce, sliced peaches, Thomasville Green Hill cheese, spiced pecans, pickled onions and Champagne vinaigrette), shrimp and oyster po’boys, shrimp and grits, and key lime pie. To drink, there’s beer, wine and signature cocktails like Low Country Bourbon Punch, Shell Island Sipper and Harrison's Bloody Mary. For the best views, you can enjoy your meal outdoors, where there’s a covered patio, fireplace and a grass lawn with an adult-sized Connect Four game and cornhole sets. If you’re stopping by to watch sports, the rectangular wraparound bar is the place to be, with eight big-screen televisions hung around the center of the bar area. The bar area. Credit: The St. Joe Company Harrison’s Kitchen & Bar is located at 5 Harrison Avenue in Panama City, Florida. They are open Tuesday to Sunday, with brunch on Sundays and lunch every other day of the week. Pop by for live music by local bands at 6 p.m. on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and during Sunday brunch from 10 to 11 a.m. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations, but you can book the space for private dinners and events.
