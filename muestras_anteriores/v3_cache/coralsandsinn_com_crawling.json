Taking 18 months to explore and gain experience within other West Country hotels, Ali found himself returning to the Brend Collection at Saunton Sands Hotels in 2011 as Restaurant Manager. Returning to Royal Duchy before finding his feet at The Carlyon Bay Hotel in 2012. Fast forward to the present day, Ali is now General Manager working closely with Directors. Marta Supranowicz Deputy Manager Marta has been a vital part of The Carlyon Bay Hotel for 18 years. First making her debut in 2005 as a waitress in the Bay View Restaurant. Marta quickly worked her way up to Restaurant Supervisor before joining the Management team in 2008 undertaking training throughout all departments of the hotel. This grounding along with her engaging personality, exceptional customer service and her ethos of hard-working led her to become Deputy Hotel Manager in 2016. Holly Balanici Senior Assistant Manager Joining the hotel in 2017 as a Lounge Bar Assistant, Holly's natural leadership qualities and strong customer service skills soon led to her promotion to Junior Assistant Manager. Having gained her Level 4 Hospitality Management Apprenticeship with Brend Collection and HIT Training in 2019, Holly progressed to become a full-time Assistant Manager at the hotel before setting her sights on becoming a manager at the Golf Club. In 2021 Holly decided it was time to return to the hotel taking on the role of Senior Assistant Manager. Natasha Vincent Reservations Manager Natasha started working in reception in 1989 as part of the hotel’s YTS scheme. Over the years, Natasha has become a familiar face for many of our regular guests.
