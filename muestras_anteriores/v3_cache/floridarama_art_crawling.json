Since its debut in September 2021, the only constant at the immersive, walk-through art experience FloridaRAMA has been change. Rather than a static gallery or museum of art, FloridaRAMA is its own world of whimsy, where nothing is as it seems – and nothing is as it was even a year or two ago. From major, room-sized additions to small and almost imperceptible upgrades, “We’re adding something almost daily,” CEO Liz Dimmitt said. “I’m a maximalist, and I want more and more layers. That’s what I think we’re all going for here.” Just this week, works by five new artists, all of them Floridians, have been added to the mix at the FloridaRAMA funhouse. Vortex Veritas by Nicole Salgar. Nicole Salgar has installed Vortex Veritas , a small room, pulsating with lights and music, through which visitors must pass to enter the topsy-turvy universe Dimmitt and her team of creatives have constructed. The name translates as “truth portal,” and it’s an invitation to visitors to leave their own “truths” behind as they stroll into the art-and-technology alt-Florida, where all senses are engaged in a sort of carnival ride, using lights, video, color, music and even programmed aromas. “The truth portal,” Dimmitt insisted, “is your adjustment from there to here.” Past the neon lobby of the Mermaid Star Motel (with its interactive guest rooms) and the motel pool (on the ceiling) is Salgar’s second installation, Cabana Confessional . These are changing cabanas that double as, well, curtained confessionals. There are surprises inside. “ Cabana Confessional is that perfect tongue-in-cheek, fun, contemplative, smart example of that high-low phenomenon we’re going for over and over again,” Dimmitt explained. There is no right or wrong way to commit to the FloridaRAMA experience, she insisted, and no set timeline. Many visitors will walk through first as an overview, to take it all in, then slow down to investigate each room’s myriad smaller details. Lamp by Guy Williams. Also new are six new steampunk lamps by artist Guy Williams , each made from found materials and switched on to do unusual things with light. These are now part of the “cabinet of curiosities” in Rae’s Lampscape Room , along with miniature robot assemblages made with “brass, scrap metal, and personality” by artist Mike Norton . Said Dimmitt: “We’re always trying to be new, fresh, relevant, but we like to say our aesthetic is ‘retro futuristic.’ That Jetsons -type thing, like what people in the past imagined the future to be like.” iBOMS, “Joy For All.” Nearby is a digital “diorama bench” by artist Type_n (aka (Tyler Norman), fusing natural forms with dreamlike, tech-infused aesthetics, and a two-headed alligator sculpture ( Mythological Guardians ) by the artist Dolios . In 2024, Jabari Reed-Diop (also known as iBOMs ) contributed a series of distinctive glowing and iridescent wall images, using his trademark cartoon characters in a series of wildlife encounters. His installation is called Joy For All. FloridaRAMA does have a narrative storyline, Dimmitt explained, tying in the centrally-located retro-motel and its fictional owners, astrophysicist and inventor Rae Current and his retired mermaid wife, Pearl. There are “guides,” known as “pink vesters,” roaming the spaces. “They don’t work for FloridaRAMA; they’re employees of the Mermaid Star Motel,” Dimmitt said. “Some of them are very performative and into the whole thing, while others might not be as much. So they embrace it as much as they want to.” Visitors will recognize patterns in the artwork, and can pick up clues along the way as to how Rae and Pearl designed and intended FloridaRAMA – but it isn’t necessary. It’s all part of the “choose your own” experience. “It seems like there’s so much going on around you, but there are intentional elements either repeated over and over again, or placed in your path in a certain pattern that makes them more monumental.” Sometimes just wandering around is its own reward. Palehorse, “Temple of Cosmic Balance.” “A lot of things are triggered by your movement; they’re only appearing because you’re there,” Dimmitt explained. “Others are there to encourage people to be hands-on, to be playful and have fun in the space. And there are QR codes in every area, so that if you’re interested it tells you about every artist and every artwork. “So there is didactic information available, but the narrative, we’re learning over time how to share it, in an in-world way that doesn’t just have a bunch of signs and descriptions everywhere. And we like to do that in a really playful way.” Another recent addition: The Pirate Ship Ball Pit (yes, you can climb in). FloridaRAMA in recent years has added scavenger hunts and games, for different ages. Also new is a “members lounge,” to be utilized for birthday parties, art salons and other events. Coming May 24 is “Day of Play,” a family festival in collaboration with Sunshine City With Kids. Find info here . Four years into their big adventure, Dimmitt and the FloridaRAMA creative team continue to monitor visitor preferences to “see what works.” Remaining open to new ideas – to change – is paramount. Always there, however, is the commitment to build up their immersive world with the work of local artists. “Since we’re not a theme park or a movie set, we have all these artists who we’ve partnered with, who we’ve commissioned to have their art here,” Dimmitt said. “We also want to give their art individual moments, and be part of a whole experience.” FloridaRAMA website .

A bonus pick, Sugar Coat Disco, invites close looking and delight with its hidden “magical spoon.”\n\nThese works illustrate what FloridaRAMA does best: connect guests to local artists through immersive design, interactive narrative, and unforgettable visuals.\n\nRead the full post: https://lnkd.in/ewQqwjci #FloridaRAMA #ImmersiveArt #StPeteArts #CulturalAttractions #ThingsToDoInStPete #MuseumInnovation #CreativeTourism My five favorite artworks at Floridarama floridarama.art Like Comment Share Join now to see what you are missing Find people you know at FloridaRAMA Browse recommended jobs for you View all updates, news, and articles Join now Similar pages Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg FL Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos St Petersburg, Florida The Factory St. Pete Entertainment Providers St Petersburg, Florida Imagine Museum Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos St. Petersburg, Florida Tampa Bay NACE Hospitality Tampa, FL HYPE Tampa Bay Hospitality Tampa, FL Tampa Museum of Art Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos Tampa, Florida Duke Energy Center for the Arts - Mahaffey Theater Performing Arts St Petersburg, Florida Total Hotel Sales Hospitality St. Petersburg Downtown Partnership Civic and Social Organizations St Petersburg, FL St. Petersburg Museum of History Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos St Petersburg, Florida Show more similar pages Show fewer similar pages Browse jobs Sales Manager jobs 310,050 open jobs Sales Director jobs 83,949 open jobs Supply Chain Program Manager jobs 4,842 open jobs Project Manager jobs 253,048 open jobs More searches More searches Group Sales Manager jobs Sales Marketing Manager jobs Hotel Manager jobs Business Manager jobs Business Development Specialist jobs Sales Manager jobs 3D Artist jobs Designer jobs LinkedIn © 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines العربية (Arabic) বাংলা (Bangla) Čeština (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) Ελληνικά (Greek) English (English) Español (Spanish) فارسی (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Français (French) हिंदी (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) עברית (Hebrew) 日本語 (Japanese) 한국어 (Korean) मराठी (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ਪੰਜਾਬੀ (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Português (Portuguese) Română (Romanian) Русский (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) తెలుగు (Telugu) ภาษาไทย (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) Türkçe (Turkish) Українська (Ukrainian) Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) 简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified)) 正體中文 (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Agree & Join LinkedIn By clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement , Privacy Policy , and Cookie Policy .

All Posts Search How to Make an Abstract Collage! juliec18 Jun 17, 2024 2 min read Have fun, expand your art-making practice and spark your curiosity as you follow along with our Education Manager, Liv Scully, in making a weird, wacky, wonderful collage! Here, we show you how to create something new with materials and tools that you may already have at home. If you’re local to Tampa Bay and would like collage materials, contact us at education@fairgrounds.art and say “Yes! I’d like a FREE collage kit!” and we can coordinate so you can pick up your free collage making kit (*this free kit is one-per person and only available until April 9th, or until supplies last!) At Fairgrounds St. Pete, education is about opening a world of possibilities. We want to inspire YOU to expand your repertoire of what you know and can do! To get started, you’ll need: Something sticky – like glue or tape! Scissors or an x-acto knife Collage materials, i.e. books, magazines, or photographs A piece of paper, used cardboard box, canvas, or a sketchbook! Optional: download and print your own Fairgrounds coloring sheet here to use our characters in your collage! WATCH THE VIDEO OR FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW! To get started, gather your materials and set up your space. A big part of the creative process is giving yourself room to grow your practice! It doesn’t need to be fancy, or even all that big: some counter space, or a cleared off desk is a great place to start. Throw on your favorite music or podcast to set the tone of the space and for an added boost of inspiration! Spend some time with your collage materials: go through and take note of anything that sparks your curiosity! Pay attention to textures and colors that pop out at you! Take a look around your space to see if you have anything you already love that you could use to add to your work! To set the tone of your collage, try to find or create something to use as a background! You could layer multiple images, draw or paint a shape, add on top of something that already exists or just leave it blank! When you find some elements you like, play around with the composition! The composition is how the elements of art interact with each other. Try turning your collage from horizontal to vertical, and moving around different elements before starting to glue! Use your collage materials to layer images, fill up the space and manipulate the background.  There is no wrong way to collage! Once you’ve got your elements where you want them, go ahead and start to glue the individual pieces down, starting with the background! Get creative with your placement and gluing – it’s okay to extend off the canvas and layer pieces to highlight different parts of the composition. Pro-tip: if using liquid glue, try to use as little as possible! Too much glue can cause paper to wrinkle. Voila! A weird, wacky, wonderful collage. Now, to find a place to display your masterpiece!

With its growth comes a new name: FloridaRAMA. ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - The unique arts destination known as Fairgrounds St. Pete will now be called FloridaRAMA. \"With technology and our phones, we sort of have multimedia things going all the time. It's a really fun way to bring art into that arena,\" said Liz Dimmitt, CEO and Co-Founder. \"We really focus on celebrating weird whacky wonderful Florida, so we mean the people, the history, the art, the animals.\" Along with the name change, the attraction, which opened in 2021, will expand with a café and bar. Dimmitt expects increased attendance as the local art scene grows and synergy between local galleries increases. \"They sort of give it its soul and personality, St. Pete in particular has been incredibly smart about cultivating the arts,\" shared Dimmitt. READ: Japanese culture in Clearwater at Kitsune Sushi FloridaRAMA, at 2606 Fairfield Ave. S. in St. Pete's Warehouse Arts District, displays the work of more than 75 artists in an immersive, dramatic, high-tech way with sight, sound, and even smell. Dimmitt said event space is available for parties and other special occasions and there are no limits on what kind of art can be presented in new ways. \"Just this month we're going to partner with American Stage to have our first ever live theater performance inside the experience,\" she said. According to Dimmitt, FloirdaRAMA is retro-futuristic. If George Jetson and Florida Man partnered to open an art gallery, this would be it. For more information, click here .
