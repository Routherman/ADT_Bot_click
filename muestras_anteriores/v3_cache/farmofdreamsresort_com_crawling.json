We initially purchased this property without a clear plan. We named our farm, Farm of Dreams with inspiration from the phrase from the movie Field of Dreams. “If you build it, they will come.” At the time I wasn’t really sure of who we were referring to, but the more friends and family that came out to our property, the more the vision became clear that we were supposed to share the glory of this property with others. This was the first property we looked at and the others just didn’t measure up to the beauty of this property. Developing the property has been a long process– it took 4 years just to get things approved. We are delighted with how the resort has come together. It started with people and friends who wanted to stay here. Our family has camped most of our life and we hold many great memories as a family camping. We wanted to create a positive place where people can come together and enjoy friendship, family, and all of God’s glory. We prayed about it and we were guided to open our property to the public for camping and special events. We have combined nature with recreation and were determined to develop this property as an Agrotourism destination where one can unplug from the real world and be reminded of what life is all about. This is what we hope Farm of Dreams is for you. The real magic of the property is its uniqueness and ability to make you feel at home as you drive up the trail for the first time. Our goal was to take the acreage and turn it into a place where others can create countless, dear memories on its grounds, just as we have over the years. Our sincerest desire is that you and your loved ones can do the same. We hope to see you soon. - The Matthews Family View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize Location 2248 Culbreath Road Brooksville, Florida 34602 Contact info@farmofdreamsresort.com 352-806-3444 Website made with love by Roots Creative Co."

The staff is kind and always available to help (for example they provided us with a phon and helped with the luggages).  The room was clean as any place in the lodge.  During the evening we spent there was a small exhibition from local artists with music, dance and acrobatics.  I am rewarding 4 stars and not 5 because: - the breakfast was very american oriented  - the buffet dinner food quality and variety were lacking - the dining tables were not cleaned properly after previous guests used them M‍a‍t‍t‍h‍e‍w‍ ‍P June 16, 2025 The accomodation was great, comfortable bed and amenities were good.   Local entertainment round the pool at night was a lot of fun! Despite tipping they will try to get you to buy stuff off them so be prepared to be firm if you’re not interested!   The food was a buffet which was unfortunately rather average however. G‍u‍e‍s‍t‍ ‍U‍s‍e‍r August 30, 2025 A wonderful and exotic environment beautifully decorated in and out. Flexible and dry friendly staff. Accommodations were adequate but could use more room lighting and faster wifi. G‍u‍e‍s‍t‍ ‍U‍s‍e‍r August 22, 2025 This is a must either before or after your safari. They GET hospitality. The staff are welcoming, attentive, kind, and all smiles. Nothing is too much trouble. Beautiful grounds. Great room and bedding. Excellent spa and massage! Great pool but a bit cold for my blood. G‍u‍e‍s‍t‍ ‍U‍s‍e‍r August 20, 2025 Everyone was so wonderful working welcoming us with music and dance great food great coffee everyone's so friendly a once in a lifetime experience e‍b‍b‍a‍ ‍w February 8, 2025 Extraordinary staff, so nice and helpful.
