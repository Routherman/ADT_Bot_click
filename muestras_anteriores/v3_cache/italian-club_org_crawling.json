Posted Damian Mandola, founder and owner of Mandola's Italian Kitchen, is celebrating a remarkable milestone—50 years since he opened his first restaurant at just 21 years old. This June, Mandola will commemorate this golden anniversary with special festivities and delicious offerings. The journey began with Damian's Fine Italian Food, which he launched while a senior in college. Over the decades, Mandola has established 12 restaurant concepts, including the widely recognized Carrabba’s and Mandola's, which opened in 2006 as an open kitchen, counter-service concept, and Italian market. At Mandola's, guests can experience fresh, scratch-made Italian cuisine made from family recipes. To mark this special year, Mandola's is rolling back the price of its beloved Spaghetti and Meatballs to just $2.25—the price it was 50 years ago! This offer will be available to the first 50 guests at each location on June 16, the anniversary date. Join Mandola in celebrating 50 years of dedication to authentic Italian cuisine by visiting their locations in Riverview, Carrollwood, Oldsmar, and Odessa. For more information, visit Mandolas.com .

The first recorded Italian immigrant buried in the cemetery was in 1893. Buried among the members of the Italian Club is Blanche Armwood (1890-1939), a nationally known educator. The Italian Club Cemetery includes a parcel belonging to the Societa de Mutuo Soccorso (Mutual Aid Society). Throughout the cemetery are the imported ceramic photograph markers on the headstones with many inscribed in Sicilian and Italian to pay homage to Sicily, where the stonecutters perfected their craft in granite and marble. A cherished set of rituals governed the Italian funeral. Hundreds of people walked in a cortege, often pausing for a final tribute in front of the deceased’s house and the Italian Club where flags of Italy and the United States stood at half mast. A brass band led them to the cemetery followed by family and paesani (countrymen). This ritual celebrated the decedent’s service to the community. In the early years, each club member contributed one dollar to the bereaved family. Later, the club established a $300 survivor benefit. NEW NICHES ARE AVAILABLE! We are pleased to share with you that we recently completed construction on two new Niche Columbariums for cremated remains (see images at below). These two new structures are located inside the existing mausoleum, secured and protected from the elements, and are made of a beautiful white Carrera marble to match the existing mausoleum.

(Photo by Hampton Dunn Collection\n                     of Florida Postcards, USF Digital Commons) Dr. Davide Tanasi , a professor in the Department of History and the director of the College of Arts and Sciences’ Institute of Digital Exploration (IDEx), presented a three-part lecture series on his research into ancient Sicily\n                  at The Italian Club of Tampa located in Ybor City. The sold-out event sought to reinvigorate the cultural legacy\n                  of the club while fostering connections between the Italian American community and\n                  USF. The Italian Club of Tampa was established to provide a space where Italian Americans\n                  could unite to navigate the social and economic challenges during the turn of the\n                  century. Today, its iconic building in Ybor City remains a hub for this community\n                  and others in the Tampa Bay area. Tanasi specializes in the archaeology of ancient Sicily, utilizing cutting-edge scientific\n                  approaches like remote sensing and biomolecular chemistry to study material culture.\n                  During the lecture series, he shared his research in three key areas: the monumental\n                  legacy of Greek and Roman Sicily, the spectacle and entertainment in Roman Sicily,\n                  focusing on gladiatorial games, and the culinary traditions of Roman Sicily. Initially motivated to organize the lecture series to energize the cultural offerings\n                  at the Italian Club, Tanasi also aimed to educate the Italian American community about\n                  their rich Sicilian heritage. “Since the vast majority of the Italian Americans in Tampa have Sicilian ancestry,\n                  it became a great opportunity for me to build a bridge between them and the fascinating\n                  ancient history of the island. Considering that I have active research projects in\n                  Sicily and that USF students routinely join me for fieldwork, I thought that it would\n                  be beneficial for the community to know what USF does to highlight the history of\n                  Sicily and train students in becoming future experts in the field,” Tanasi said. All three segments of the event were fully booked, drawing large audiences. This strong\n                  turnout provided valuable insights for Tanasi, highlighting a desire for this community\n                  to learn more about their heritage. “The lectures were incredibly well attended, with 250 people in attendance at each\n                  event. This proves first, that there is great interest and desire by this community\n                  to know more about Sicily and its charming history. Secondly, the powerful 3D visuals\n                  that I use in my presentations combined with my storytelling skills made the events\n                  informative and entertaining. Lastly, the popularization of science, in this case\n                  archaeology, is very attractive, as proven by the great success of certain historical\n                  fiction and shows available on streaming services or at movie theaters,” Tanasi said. This lecture series acted as a catalyst for bringing crucial research to a broader\n                  audience. Tanasi hopes that these events will help spread information that's typically\n                  not accessible to those outside the research field. He aims to foster connections\n                  and bridge gaps across different disciplines. “Archaeology complements history as a sister discipline, filling in gaps that historical\n                  writings may not have mentioned. While history focuses on main characters and major\n                  events, archaeology studies the lives of ordinary men and women and the minor events\n                  of their lives. For example, one of the focal points of my project, the Greek city\n                  of Heloros, is barely mentioned in the ancient sources practically making it non-existent\n                  in history. But, after three years of work on that site, we uncovered a blossoming\n                  city sprawling over 15 acres with splendid temples, public buildings, massive fortification\n                  walls, and even a theater!” Tanasi explained. Attendees observe Dr. Davide Tanasi during the three-part lecture series hosted at\n                     The Italian Club of Tampa. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Davide Tanasi) Tanasi is currently the lead for IDEx’s two significant projects in remote sensing\n                  and digital archaeology: the Heloros Advanced Digital Exploration and Surveying , and the Archaeological Heritage in Late Antique and Byzantine Sicily focusing on digital archaeology at the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Roman Villa\n                  of Casale in Piazza Armerina. Alongside his research endeavors, he is also the co-program director for the Spring\n                  Break Study Abroad Program, USF Sicily: History and Culture , offering students the chance to explore the social, political, and cultural dimensions\n                  of ancient Greece and Rome. Reflecting on the success of this lecture series, Tanasi was invited again by the\n                  Italian Club to deliver another three-part lecture series this upcoming Fall. He hopes\n                  to explore other aspects of Sicilian archaeology and unveil the secrets of this historic\n                  region.
