The Website, Platform, and any Apps, together with our related services and social media pages, are collectively referred to as our “ Services. ” By visiting, accessing, and/or using our Services, you agree to this Agreement, you acknowledge our Privacy Policy , and you certify that you are at least 18 years of age and that you are providing truthful and accurate information about yourself. This Agreement does not modify the terms of any separate agreement(s) that you have entered into or may enter into with Cove, such as when you book a rental or stay, purchase a home from us, visit or parks or properties, or use any related services. Your access to, and use of, the Services may be subject to additional notices or additional terms and conditions, such as the separate agreement(s) described above, in addition to this Agreement (“ Additional Terms ”). In the event that any Additional Terms apply to the Services, such Additional Terms will be made available to you through the Services and/or provided separately by Cove. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Additional Terms and this Agreement with respect to the Services, then the Additional Terms shall control in relation to the impacted part of the Services. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, WHICH (I) REQUIRES THAT YOU AND COVE ARBITRATE CERTAIN CLAIMS BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF GOING TO COURT; AND (II) LIMITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. WHO WE ARE AND HOW TO CONTACT US The Services are operated by COVE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, LP, a corporation registered in Delaware, United States, with a principal business address of 2999 North 44 th St, Suite 200 Phoenix, AZ 85018.

PRIVACY Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information regarding how we collect, use, and disclose information about you in connection with your use of our Services.  The terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy are incorporated into this Agreement. If you provide any personal information about a third party, such as a referral, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary permission, and have obtained all necessary consent, to provide such personal information to us, and that our use of such personal information in accordance with this Agreement will not violate the privacy rights of such third party or any applicable law. COMMITMENT TO ACCESSIBILITY We are continuously working to improve the accessibility of our Website and ensure that it complies with recognized standards, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA. Our goal is to make the browsing experience as inclusive as possible for all users. Key Features of Our Website’s Accessibility: We aim to incorporate the following accessibility features: Language Tagging : The website includes language tags to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers and Braille translators, facilitating a more inclusive user experience. Image Text Alternatives : Efforts have been made to provide descriptive alternative text for images, aiding users with visual impairments in understanding visual content. Color Contrast : Cove has implemented sufficient color contrast between elements and the background (with a minimum of 4.5 to 1) for any text, headlines, or other elements where color plays an important part in navigating and understanding the website. Design : The website’s design incorporates several key accessibility considerations to ensure an inclusive user experience. Interactive elements do not rely on color alone to convey information, and clear, consistent navigation guides users through the site. Form elements are paired with clearly associated labels for ease of use, while touch targets are sufficiently large (at least 48x48px) with adequate spacing between elements to ensure accessibility on touch devices. The site is fully responsive, adapting to various viewport sizes for optimal usability across different devices. These design choices collectively contribute to a more accessible and user-friendly website for all visitors. Ongoing Improvement: We are committed to making continuous improvements to the accessibility of our website. We regularly review our site to ensure compliance with current accessibility standards, and we are working towards meeting the requirements of WCAG 2.1. Feedback and Assistance: If you encounter any accessibility barriers while using our website, or if you have suggestions on how we can improve our accessibility efforts, please contact us at: Email: info@covecommunities.com Phone: (855) 574-4636 Postal Address: 2999 N 44th St, Suite 200 Phoenix AZ, 85006 We value your feedback and will work promptly to address any issues.

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”  You hereby expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under that section and any law of any jurisdiction of similar effect with respect to the release of any unknown or unsuspected claims you may have against the Cove Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this section.

ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER – APPLICABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW You and Cove mutually agree to waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our respective rights to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or jury and agree to resolve any dispute by arbitration as set forth below. This agreement to arbitrate (“ Arbitration Agreement ”) survives the termination of the Terms.

Except as expressly provided below, this Section applies to all Claims (defined below) between you and Cove, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or shareholders. “Claims” means to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: the Terms and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the Services, any other goods or services made available through the Services, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your membership in the Services or this Agreement, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, and all other common law and statutory claims between you and Cove or its affiliates and their respective employees, officers, directors and shareholders. To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, neither party shall be obligated to submit to arbitration a Claim for injunctive relief, specific performance, or any other equitable remedies to which such party may be entitled. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND COVE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED.

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR ARBITRATION DEMAND MUST BE COMMENCED OR SUBMITTED TO THE AAA WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE ALLEGED INJURY HAS BEEN DISCOVERED OR REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR DEMAND IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and pursuant to the applicable AAA rules.
