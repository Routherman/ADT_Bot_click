You should play. Translated by Google . Hampe 61 167 Reviews Automatic translation Original version Difficult 4.0 of 5 stars Reviewed January 26, 2019 I played the course four times today. Very difficult, practically with all holes flanking water, and in addition many bunker. As if that were not enough, there are still hanging greens, which together with the fast Floridagreens usually results in a 3-putt! If you let the view wander a bit off the fairways, you feel like you're in the middle of the jungle; something else. All in all: Should visit during a stay in Florida. Translated by Google . pitchmark 388 Reviews Automatic translation Original version Lots of water and very spacious 4.0 of 5 stars Reviewed April 29, 2018 Flanking or frontal water on 16 holes available, which is now and then in the game. A really modern Florida course. He is one of the best public places around Fort Myers - for us the best. But he is very demanding if you want to play his score - all par 3 have more than 190 yards, 4 par 4 over 400 and 2 par 5 over 600. Slope 145 / Rating75.4 says a lot. Solid straight punches, sometimes courageous ones are mandatory. And he second in the green must also fit. In addition, some green forms are almost mean. Flat to slightly undulating fairways await the player. They had a lot of fun today, the balls rolled. The bunkers serve here more the stray balls to the strategy. The greens are usually quite large, some well defended. Others do not need any, they are very narrow and very long or very wide with very little depth. That makes the attacking extremely difficult. You have to read them very well, because they have very nice breaks. They were excellent to play today, tough and very fast. They ruined our score today. Excellent maintained facility - big compliment. Two years ago, the order of the holes was changed to the first nine, which has a very positive effect on the flow of the game. Unfortunately, the course has lost some of its charm. Part of the forests - spruces - which accompany the holes were felled, created a huge construction site. Houses are built. A good, nice - especially the locker, really English. Very nice staff. It's always fun to play here, he's on the list almost every year. Not all were for 5 stars, the construction sites because there are only 4. Translated by Google . Been to The Golf Club at Magnolia Landing ? Share your experiences!
