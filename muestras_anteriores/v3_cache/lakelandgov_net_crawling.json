Moore, LkldNow On Friday morning at Barnett Family Park Playground, children pushed each other on swings, splashed in the water area, and avoided an 18-inch metal post wrapped in yellow caution tape sticking up out of the rubber safety mat near the Peggy Brown Building. At the same time, just up the street, city commissioners discussed a $303,400 contract to renovate and install new equipment for part of the park, possibly beginning in November. Keep up with what’s happening in Lakeland with only one email a week. Sign up Deputy Director of Parks & Recreation Pam Page told commissioners that the playground is one of the city’s most popular. But some of the equipment in the 20-year-old park needs to be replaced, as does the safety surface, which is a rubber surface with a little give. “We have been very, very successful in extending the life of our playground equipment and the reason being is that we have now on staff three certified playground inspectors,” Page said.  “They do a yeoman’s job in inspecting all of the playgrounds weekly … and because they’re so on top of the maintenance, we’ve really seen that the life of the playgrounds have been extended as a result of that.” Children play in the Barnett Family Park Playground, avoiding a post sticking up from the ground that once held a spinner. | Kimberly C. Moore, LkldNow If approved on Monday, REP Services, Inc., based in Longwood, would build custom equipment designed to fit in the existing playground footprint. The total amount for the playground and surfacing materials, installation and removal of existing equipment and freight is $303,400. The contract would piggyback with a Clay County contract, providing a discount of $1,700. “The swings have been replaced one time and we’re not replacing them this time because they’re in perfect working order,” Page said. “The spinners we have replaced once one time before and the great big climbing net. We replaced the net only.” This time, the climbing net and pole, and the kids-in-motion spinner will be replaced.  Four play elements will be added, including three spinners and a bouncer. The swings and musical equipment will remain. Commissioner Sarah Roberts McCarley said the park was cutting edge in 2004 because it was in the first wave of parks in which all children, regardless of their ability, could play. “This is such a highlight, I feel like, for the city of Lakeland and if we look at, you know, encouraging our young people to be outside a thousand hours, and that play is really learning,” McCarley said. “You guys do such a great job and I wanted to bring up the point that because of your maintenance, we don’t do this regularly. … It’s time. You are doing such a great job, keeping it up to date, but also including every child, which is huge.” She reminisced about her children growing up in that park over the years. “I took my then not quite 2-year-old to the opening of that park. She’s now a junior in college,” Roberts McCarley said. “I also had a 5-year-old birthday party at Peggy Brown (Building), but we enjoyed that. And he’s now 18.” Support independent local news for Lakeland Keep LkldNow freely accessible. We rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.

Contribute Now Children play in the Barnett Family Park Playground. | Kimberly C. Moore, LkldNow Lakeland’s playgrounds offer a variety of challenges Page said a great deal of thought goes into playground design and which equipment to place in each location. “It’s funny because you want your kids to play and have fun, and you really don’t want them to realize how hard they’re working on developing all of their muscles and everything. A lot goes into the selection of the equipment that we have, and we have different playgrounds that achieve different levels of physical development,” Page said. “One of our most difficult playgrounds is at Fletcher Park at Lake Bonny. That playground is designed for children to develop their cores.” Commissioner Chad McLeod said he likes taking his children to different parks in the city so they can have different experiences. They are 10, 9 and 6 years old. “I don’t think I’ve always appreciated that when we take our kids,” McLeod said. “We just know this one’s different than another one. But I know there’s a lot of thought and planning into making each park a unique experience. And I agree, I think the swings are — I was on one with one of the kids — I think they are in good shape.” A rendering of the new equipment for a portion of Barnett Family Park playground. | Kimberly C. Moore, LkldNow Mayor Bill Mutz asked if the height of the climbing net will remain the same and was assured that it would, but it will be wider. “I like the height being the same because I race my grandkids to the top,” said the mayor, who has 34 grandchildren. “I like the fact that there’s a little risk in what they do to on these things, that we don’t take a very super safe path always on everything and we allow people to be able to stretch. It’s good and so this is wonderful.” The commission will vote on the contract at its meeting Monday morning. If approved, REP Services will begin building the equipment, which should be installed in November. The water park and Sunflower Preschool Playground will remain open during construction.

Corporate Pavilion Rental Info Walking Trail Map & Information Lake Parker Park boasts multiple walking trails designed for the enjoyment of casual strollers and serious runners alike. Each of the park's four distinct path systems is color-coded and contains markers to help people orient themselves in the park. Forest Path : .66 miles; circles the original park built in 1978 and is the path that parallels the Lake Parker shoreline. The vegetative plantings along the Forest Path and the other path systems are Lakeland Parks and Recreation's largest xeriscape landscaping effort. While strolling among the trees, test your physical abilities on the Park's exercise sta­tions. Other park amenities found adjacent to the Forest Path are family-sized picnic sheds, sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, and boat access to Lake Parker. Water Path : .84 miles; Lake Parker Park's longest loop connecting each of the Park's three other walking paths. The Water Path takes you on a journey through the Park's wetland hardwood forest. If you're quiet and observant, you may get a glimpse at some of the animals that make their home in Lake Parker Park. When in bloom, blue flag iris create a beautiful vista, particularly in the vicinity of Potato Creek Bridge. Soccer Path : .76 miles; circles the entire soccer complex. While walking among the pine forest and wildflowers, observe Lakeland's finest young athletes practicing and competing. North Path : .8 miles; the path system's northernmost loop is connected to the southern portion of Lake Parker via the bridge over the Parker Canal. The North Path circles the Park's lawn bowling & shuffleboard facility, pickleball courts, two sand volleyball courts, and corporate picnic pavilions (available for rental). GPS Enabled Walking Map Disc Golf Lake Parker Park boasts a 9-hole disc golf course on the park's northern edge with access via either entrance. Find more details and descriptions of each hole on our Disc Golf Page . History Lake Parker Park was developed in the mid 1970s as a free play/passive recreation area. Phase I opened in 1978.

Jenkins. Jenkins Barnett, 65, was born and raised in Lakeland, Florida. She began with Publix in 1972 as a cashier at Grove Park Shopping Center in Lakeland and later worked in Publix’s corporate marketing research and development department. In 1983, she was elected to the Publix board of directors where she served for 33 years. View the Publix press release here. In 1983, she joined the foundation’s board of directors (which would later become Publix Super Markets Charities) which instilled in her a passion for the needs of the communities Publix serves.This experience gave her a deeper understanding of her father’s interests, philosophies and goals for philanthropic giving. Following her father’s stroke in 1989, the charity's board appointed her chair. In 1991, she was named chair and president. Because of her philanthropic spirit, she and her husband, Barney Barnett, have been involved in generously giving back to nonprofit organizations including United Way, Florida Partnership for School Readiness, and Family Fundamentals, as well as countless others. Over the years, they have funded numerous community projects including Barnett Park, and the Carol Jenkins Barnett Pavilion for Women and Children at Lakeland Regional Health. Her final philanthropic gift was the founding of Bonnet Springs Park. Without her, Bonnet Springs Park wouldn't be a reality. We are immensely grateful for her beautiful gift that will improve the quality of life for future generations within the central Florida area. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Bonnet Springs Park. Donate Bonnet Springs Park is a privately developed public park that depends solely on public support. There are several ways that you can help make this dream for Lakeland's future generations become reality, and make it possible for friends and families to create endless memories at the park.

Instead, he moved to a village on the wilderness shores of Lake Babine.

Ivan engaged with northern BC communities in the land use planning initiatives of the nineties that led to a doubling of the BC’s protected areas network, and later with North Coast indigenous communities in accessing conservation financing to enable their environmental and economic visions for the Great Bear Rainforest.

Champions Robert Bateman Founding Member & Champion In many ways parks have made me who I am. As an Ontario boy, I thought of Algonquin Park as a kind of Nirvana. It denoted wilderness and nature in a pure form. Wolves roamed there. When I landed a job, ages 17-19, doing “chores” at the research station, I thought I’d died and gone to heaven. It also became apparent that the people who worked in parks, the rangers and naturalists, were an important part of the scene. They appreciate and protect nature for others to enjoy. These people became my role models. BC parks are among the most spectacular in the world because this province is blessed with a great variety of natural habitats from mountains to marine. We need to use them or lose them but at the same time we must not love them to death with too many amenities. It will take vigilance and budgets to guarantee that our parks will be as beneficial to future generations as they are to us. Wade Davis My life took a turn at 15 when I spent a summer in Manning Park, working as a member of the Youth Crew, building trails, fighting fires, maintaining the campgrounds. Splitting firewood in the sun, with room and board and three dollars a day the only financial reward, taught me that work is not about money; it's about pride, strength, perseverance and grit, values that would forge the foundation of my professional life. Altogether, I worked eight seasons for BC Parks, culminating in a much coveted position as the first park ranger in the Spatsizi Plateau, British Columbia's largest wilderness park. My job description was deliciously vague; public relations and wilderness assessment. In two four month seasons my partner and I encountered not a dozen visitors, leaving us free to wander, as we mapped the trails, surveyed the wildlife, ran the rivers, and established routes up all the major peaks. This prolonged apprenticeship with the Parks, all that I learned in E.C. Manning and Naikoon, Mount Assiniboine, Atlin Mountain, Mount Edziza, and Spatsizi Plateau, left me with both a deep appreciation of nature, and a profound sense of belonging, a spirit of place that is the essence of Canadian patriotism. In good measure, I owe my life and career to BC Parks. Surely the opportunities that I had in my youth, the chance to unburden an adolescent mind and reward the body with hard physical work, to experience for the first time the true miracle of nature, to seek the promise of transformation, even transcendence, as found only in the wild heart of the world, ought to be part of the birthright of every new generation of British Columbians. Ben Haggar Freelance photographer, writer, and content creator Spending time recreating in nature was a keystone of my upbringing and set me on a path to appreciate and help to protect wild places. Connecting with nature allows me to feel centred and balanced within myself. When I moved to BC from Ontario at age 19, I was overwhelmed at the scale of the fog cloaked mountains, old growth cedars, and cold green waves rolling in towards pristine beaches. With so much incredible diversity, I couldn’t believe that the entire province wasn’t one huge provincial park! I feel incredibly lucky for the recreational opportunities here in BC. From surfing Naikoon in Haida Gwaii, bikepacking the South Chilcotins, ski touring at Kokanee, and climbing the Squamish Chief and Garibaldi from my front door. It gives me real peace of mind knowing that these special areas are protected and that there is an endless supply of new discoveries and experiences to be had right here at home in BC. Greg Hill Skier, film maker, climber, and sustainable adventurer Many of my most memorable moments were in the parks in British Columbia. I have savored my freedom moving through the mountains, contemplated life surrounded by giant cedars and finished days watching the sun set into the Pacific Ocean. These parks are the identity of BC and need to be protected and preserved for our kids and theirs, while also enjoyed by us. John Montalbano My family did not have very many luxuries. Growing up as a child in East Vancouver, our weekend family time was exploring the numerous parks to the north and east of Vancouver. Free access to parks was essential for my parents to entertain and educate my sister and me. I love our parks to this day. Dr. Sally Otto From Ruckle Provincial Park in the Garry oak ecosystem to the glacier-fed lakes of Mount Assiniboine, the parks of British Columbia are truly majestic. Camping in these parks allows families, like mine, to experience nature directly and to pass along to our children a love of wildlife. The parks are also a critical refuge for the most endangered animals and plants. BC is home to the most species diversity of any province in Canada but also home to the most species at risk. Without well managed parks, we are likely to lose dozens, if not hundreds, of the animal and plant species that make BC so special. Eric Peterson Founding Member and Champion I was born in Port Alberni and grew up on Vancouver Island. That was the era when family vacations meant packing the camping gear into the trunk of the Buick and heading off down one BC's brand new highways. It was pure exploration and discovery - the Cariboo, the Slocan Valley, the Big Bend highway, the Chilcotin - exploring the wonders of the province by day, and pulling in for the night at a BC Parks campground. Those experiences kindled my love of exploration and new vistas, which took me around the world as a scientist (biology PhD) then later as a technology entrepreneur. I founded the BC-based Tula Foundation in 2002 and set up Tula’s Hakai Institute in 2010. Hakai develops the tools, systems, people and insights we need to understand our coastal ecosystems in the context of climate change, and to deal with the consequences that are coming. We operate field stations at remote locations on the BC coast. We have our own scientific staff plus a large network that includes university researchers, government scientists and First Nations. For the past eight years we have enjoyed a very close and productive partnership with BC Parks via our Calvert Island field station, which is located in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest. Strategic Advisors Miro Ceretnig Yee Chan Bob Kronbauer Garry Mancell Roy Millen “ I can't conceive of anything being more varied, rich and handsome than planet earth: its crowning beauty is the natural world. I want to soak it up, to understand it ... then put it together and express it in my painting. This is the way I want to dedicate my life. ” Robert Bateman, artist Subscribe to our newsletter today.

Applicants must meet all requirements established by the Florida Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission. Applicants must also possess a current State of Florida Police Officer Certification or meet Commission Comparable Compliance. The requirements are enumerated in F.S. 943.13 (listed below). Applicants will be required to pass ALL elements of the selection process prior to being employed as a Lakeland Police Officer. REQUIRED DOCUMENTS Copy of birth certificate. Copy of valid passport if applicable. Copy of valid driver license. Copy of State of Florida Law Enforcement Certification (If you are Florida Certified). Copy of High School Diploma. Copy of DD214 – Military Discharge (if applicable). Applicants for the position of POLICE OFFICER are required to submit a copy of ALL required documents with the employment application. Applicants will not be eligible for employment until ALL required documents have been submitted to CIVIL SERVICE or uploaded with the application.  Required documents will not be accepted after the closing of the job posting. ELEMENTS OF THE SELECTION PROCESS Our system allows you to work on your application and save the application without submitting it. This is done to allow you to save your work and come back to finish the application without having to start over. If you submit your application and do not \"complete\" it before 4 p.m. on the posted close date (listed on the job opportunities page), your application will be rejected from the system and you will have to start the application over. The application WILL NOT be accepted or reviewed until it is \"complete\" . After submission of the completed application (including ALL required documents) the application will be accepted. Once the application is accepted, the Personnel Services Section of the Lakeland Police Department will review the application and you will be contacted within 60 days of the \"accepted\" date. Next, you will be required to take and pass a Physical Abilities Test and have your fingerprints taken to assist in the background phase of the hiring process. If selected to move to the next phase, you will attend an interview conducted by a panel. The panel will consist of a minimum of three police department members. A thorough background investigation, including a polygraph test, will be completed on all candidates prior to employment. Those applicants that are selected for employment will be given a conditional offer of employment. The job offer is contingent upon the successful completion and approval of a polygraph examination, psychological fitness examination, medical examination, drug screen testing and completed background investigation. The applicant will receive written notice either by mail or electronic mail at each phase of the selection process advising them that they were selected to move forward in the process or that they were not selected. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the e-mail address provided on the application is correct and to provide any updated information to Civil Service during the application process. Once a decision has been reached to offer the applicant employment OR that the applicant will not be offered employment, applicants will be notified within 30 days. The intent of the Lakeland Police Department's Personnel Services Section is that the selection process, from the date of the post exam until the applicant is advised of a decision regarding employment, will not extend beyond 180 days. When an applicant is selected for employment and all elements of the selection process have been passed, the applicant will begin the in-house \"Mini-Academy\". The Mini-Academy is a six to eight-week training program that provides recruits with the necessary knowledge and skills to begin the Field Training Program. Once the recruit successfully passes the Mini Academy they will begin the 16 week Field Training Program. The recruit will be on probationary status until their one year probationary period is successfully completed. PHYSICAL ABILITY TEST This test consists of a standardized obstacle course which was created and recommended by the FDLE Criminal Justice and Standards Training Commission for Police Officers. It simulates activities that may be encountered while working in this position at the Lakeland Police Department.  Applicants should wear proper clothing and shoes for the test. Test is administered on a pass/fail basis. The course consists of the following tasks (not necessarily in the order you may experience them). The time limit for this test is 6 minutes and 4 seconds: Exit from the seated, safety-belted driver's position of a parked motor vehicle With opposite hands, remove two flags fastened to a belt with Velcro, from your back Utilizing the vehicles' keys, retrieve from the car trunk a flashlight to be carried during the following stages: - 220-yard run (twice) - Jump over a four (4) foot wall - Run through a series of cones - Jump over a series of three (3) hurdles - A low crawl under three (3) hurdles - Drag a 150-pound dummy for 100 feet - Dry fire a service pistol six (6) times with the strong hand and six (6) times with the weak hand - Return the flashlight to the vehicle trunk - Return to the safety belted driver's position of the vehicle BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION A background investigation of each candidate for all positions is conducted prior to employment.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FITNESS EXAMINATION : An emotional stability and psychological fitness examination of each candidate for a sworn position is conducted and assessed by a qualified professional prior to appointment to probationary status.

The family friendly park includes a splash pad water feature, two age-appropriate playgrounds including the Sunflower Preschool Playground, labyrinth, covered picnic area, restrooms, and a multipurpose field.

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS: Collection is open to all researchers. USE RESTRICTIONS : Restrictions may apply concerning the use, photoduplication, or publication of items in this collection. Consult a member of the archives staff for information concerning these restrictions. The user assumes all responsibility for identifying and satisfying any claimants of copyright. EXTENT : 0.42 linear feet DATE : 1936 - 2022 SCOPE AND CONTENT : The Jim Barnett Park Collection contains materials concerning the development of Jim Barnett Park in Winchester, Virginia. The bulk of the materials are organizational papers, tax records, correspondence, committee reports, and plans, produced by the Winchester-Frederick County War Memorial Association, which began campaigning to develop the park in 1945. There are also budget reports from the years, 1969 to 1974, information about the Fast Pitch Softball Hall of Fame, and newspaper clippings. BIOGRAPHICAL/HISTORICAL : Jim Barnett Park began as a small community playground located on land on the outskirts of Winchester City and offered organized recreational activities for the town’s residents.   In 1945, the Winchester-Frederick County War Memorial Association initiated a fund-raising campaign to build a complex honoring veterans of Winchester and Frederick County. The campaign was successful, and a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new War Memorial Building took place on November 11, 1956. The City has continued to expand the park by adding various new features and amenities. The park is named after James E. Barnett, who served as its director for thirty years before his retirement in 1987. Barnett was a native of Huntington, West Virginia and attended the University of Kentucky. He began his career with the City of Winchester in 1957. At the time, the Winchester Recreation Park consisted of the original War Memorial Building and some picnic shelters. During his tenure, Barnett oversaw a significant expansion of the park’s offerings, including the swimming pool complex, Christianson Familyland, an amphitheater, a fishing lake, sports facilities, and other amenities. He also encouraged local civic groups to sponsor picnic shelters and established numerous sports programs for children and youth. On August 26, 1987, the Winchester Parks & Recreation Board resolved that the City Recreation Park should be known as “Jim Barnett Park.” RELATED MATERIAL: Teen Age Club (TAC) Collection, 1675 THL CITE AS : Jim Barnett Park Collection, 755 WFCHS, Stewart Bell Jr. Archives, Handley Regional Library, Winchester, VA, USA.
