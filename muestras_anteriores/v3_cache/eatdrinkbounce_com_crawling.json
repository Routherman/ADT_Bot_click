Gaby Vargas A group of UCF alumni are preparing to open a new restaurant and bar down the road, inspired by the culture of the university they came from. Alumni Michael D’Esposito, Chase Tate and Anthony Zanette are the co-founders of Bounce House, which is set open in early January. D'Esposito said their initial efforts to open the restaurant were pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"COVID put us through a run,” D’Esposito said. “We probably should’ve been open a year ago.” Despite the difficulties they've faced, the restaurant was able to open Nov. 5 for a one-time, alumni-only event. Although the owners encouraged people to come and visit the restaurant, they emphasized this event did not serve as a grand opening. “We don’t want people to think that just 'cause this is going on tonight, we’re open tomorrow,” D’Esposito said. D’Esposito said it was important to them to make this alumni event work, especially being friends with one of the event heads, fellow alum Emily Smith. Smith, assistant director of the UCF Foundation's Young Alumni Engagement and Philanthropy, attended UCF around the same time as D’Esposito. Smith said the alumni council is always looking for alumni-owned businesses to partner with for the annual Black and Gold Takeover, an event designed to engage local alumni, as well as “welcome home” returning alumni. A sign for the Bounce House restaurant and bar sits on the building's storefront on Nov. 6. Although slated to officially open in early January, the restaurant's original grand opening plans were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, D'Esposito said. \"COVID put us through a run,” he said. “We probably should’ve been open a year ago.” Gaby Vargas “The appeal of a brand-new venue that was not yet open to the public gave our alumni an exclusive look and created a great energy around the event,” Smith said. D’Esposito said opening the restaurant is a project he, Tate and Zanette have wanted to do; it was just a matter of finding the right place to do it. The trio had been looking for venues around the UCF area for a couple years, so when the previous owner of the building informed them he was selling his establishment, it seemed like the right fit. The co-founders said that not only was it a venue with proximity to the university, it also felt like home to them. The location used to be home to a different restaurant, Bubbalou’s Bodacious BBQ. “I used to come and eat here with (D'Esposito's) older brother,” Tate said. Tate said he and his fellow co-founders didn't feel there were any good establishments around that would cater to alumni, which inspired them to open this new restaurant down the road from UCF on Challenger Parkway. Nonetheless, the owners don’t want to discourage younger or current students from enjoying the experience. Tate said Bounce House is also a place for younger people to go when they don't want to go downtown. However, this isn’t just another typical college bar. D'Esposito said Bounce House will be a \"full-service restaurant.\" “We definitely want to cater toward also the faculty and staff of UCF, make sure they enjoy the cuisine and the atmosphere as well,” Tate said. Tate said their goal is to provide a place for people who want to enjoy a good meal while they watch games and just have a good time. “We’re excited as alumni to finally show what some UCF culture looks like,” Tate said. “This is the culture they created … They created this: They created us.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save × Post a comment as anonymous Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.
