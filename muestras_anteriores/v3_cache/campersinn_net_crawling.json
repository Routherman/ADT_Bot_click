About Us Campers Inn was built in 1972 by the Pledger family. It was originally named Pledgers Campground and stayed that way until 1978 when it was purchased by Jon and Winston Starling. Later they decided to sell part interest to their sister Ruth Glenn. Winston ran Campers in until his death in 1988 at which point, his sister Ruth took over. Ruth ran the Campground for 19 years. In 2007 her nephew John Starling Jr purchased Ruth’s interest and is currently the president and co-owner with John Sr. Today the Campground is thriving as more people discover just how beautiful Panama City Beach, FL truly is. With the addition of Florida Watersports in the store, in front of the Campground, Campers Inn is quickly becoming a hub for all things beach related. From your standard beach gear such as chairs, towels, Sun tan lotion and food to fishing gear by Shimano, Diawa and Penn not to even mention clothing lines by HUK, Pelagic, and Mojo.
