The Dubuque County Fair Association has named a new general manager. John Bries replaces Kevin Kotz, who recently retired from the association after nearly eight years as manager, according to a press release. The release states that Bries, of Asbury, Iowa, has served as president and CEO of several area businesses and most recently was treasurer of the executive board for Bluff Strokes Art Center, a new local nonprofit for art education and for supporting artists. “I am a firm believer in creating community for families,” Bries said in the release. “I think with my business experience I can help the Fair Association continue to move in the right direction.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Dubuque-iowa Dubuque-county-iowa Elizabeth Kelsey Author email Follow Elizabeth Kelsey Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram ISSN 2993-8384 (Online) ISSN 1041-293X (Print) Sections News Obituaries Features Sports Opinion Events Store Marketplace Submit Contact Us Contact a Reporter Contact Member Support Member Services Contact Advertiser Sales Contact a TH Director × Browser Compatibility Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.
