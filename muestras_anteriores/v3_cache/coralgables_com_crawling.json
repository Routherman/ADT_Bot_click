Swale areas are part of the City’s public right-of-way; however, residents adjacent to the locations are responsible for maintenance and upkeep. Within the neighborhood streets, swale areas are often used for supplemental parking, which results in damaged vegetative areas and unrest from neighboring residents responsible for their upkeep. Excessive car parking in swales also results in compacting soils so densely that water cannot percolate properly through the soil down to the water table, therefore aggravating water ponding on streets and sidewalks. However, the City’s Public Works Department recommends swale planting solutions to promote lush landscaping, deter vehicles from parking within these areas, and serve to provide adequate drainage. Pollinators Birds, bats, bees, and butterflies, and other small insects and animals are responsible for sustaining our native ecosystems and natural resources by aiding plants to reproduce. Pollinating animals and insects travel from plant to plant collecting and carrying pollen to the reproductive plant to create a variety of benefits. In the City of Coral Gables, the staff from the Greenspace Management Division of Public Works has implemented pollinator areas in a variety of sites such as parks, roadside plantings, and at historical sites! These sites include Merrick House, Robert J.Fewell Park, Miracle Mile, Public Library Pollinator Garden, Catalonia Park, Majorca Park, and the the bat houses at the Boy Scout Hut. If you look around the city, you can witness some natural beauty in the form of flowering trees such as; the pink flowers of the Cassia Bakeriana , the beautiful yellow flowers of the Cassia Fistula and the Bulnesia arborea (Verawood) , and the red and yellow flowers of the Royal Poinciana ( Delonix regia ) trees. Some examples of the plants you will be seeing at these sites would be Coontie ( Zamia pumila ), Lantana ( Lantana involucrata & depressa ), Simpson Stopper ( Myrcianthes fragrans ), and Fakahatchee Grass ( Tripsacum dactyloides ). You can also see some original Miami-Dade County native species such as Miami-Dade County Slash Pine ( Pinus elliottii var. densa ) and the Florida Thatch Palm ( Thrinax radiata ). Southern Live Oaks (Quercus virginiana) take up about 25% of our urban tree canopy here at the City of Coral Gables. Live Oaks provide significant food and cover for wildlife including being the host plant for the Red-banded Hairstreak butterfly (Calycopis cecrops) and other species of butterflies and bugs, as well as the Oak’s acorns being food for squirrels, and nesting trees for owls and other birds. Mangroves Background Information Three species are native to Florida: Red mangrove ( Rhizophora mangle ), Black mangrove ( Avicennia germinans ) and White mangrove ( Laguncularia racemosa ). Red mangroves are easily identified by their \"prop roots,\" which are tangled, reddish, aerial roots that originate from the trunk and branches. Their leaves are 1 to 5 inches long, broad and blunt on the tip, shiny, deep green on top, and paler on the underside. Black mangroves can be identified by numerous finger-like projections, called pneumatophores, that protrude from the soil around the tree's trunk. Black mangrove leaves are oblong, shiny green on top and covered with short dense hairs on the underside. Black mangroves are usually found in slightly higher elevations upland from red mangroves. White mangroves have no visible aerial root system like red and black mangroves. The easiest way to identify white mangroves is by the leaves. The leaves are up to 3 inches long, elliptical (rounded at both ends), yellowish in color, and have two distinguishing glands at the base of each leaf blade where the stem begins. White mangroves are usually located in elevations higher and farther upland than either the red or black mangroves. Value & Functions of Mangroves Mangroves trap and cycle various organic materials, chemical elements, and important nutrients in the coastal ecosystem. Mangroves provide one of the basic food chain resources for marine organisms. Mangroves serve as storm buffers by reducing wind and wave action in shallow shoreline areas. Mangroves provide physical habitat and nursery grounds for a wide variety of marine organisms, many of which have important recreational or commercial value. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, it is estimated that mangroves contribute $7.6 billion annually to the economy and create 109,000 jobs in Florida Mangrove Trimming Mangroves are protected under Florida State Law. Trimming of most mangroves within Coral Gables will require the services of a Miami-Dade County Certified and Registered Professional Mangrove Trimmer. FDEP List of Professional Mangrove Trimmers For information on mangrove trimming permits and finding professional mangrove trimmers please contact Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management - DERM, Coastal Section Email: dermcr@miamidade.gov Phone Number: (305) 372-6575 Office location: Overtown Transit Village. 701 NW 1st Court, 6th Floor. Miami, Florida 33136 Fines/Penalties for Illegally Cutting Mangroves For a first violation, property owners may be required to restore the area. For subsequent violations, property owners and the person performing illegal trimming can be fined: Up to $100 for each mangrove illegally trimmed Up to $250 for each mangrove illegally altered Million Orchid Project Thousands of native orchid seedlings, as part of the Million Orchid Project, are being planted on Coral Gables City trees. In 2014, the Coral Gables City Commission voted to fund $30,000 to reintroduce the orchids that were once plucked from the trees to be shipped north as potted plants. In the late 1800s, masses of orchids were hauled away from South Florida’s forest to be sold as disposable houseplants. At first, there seemed to be an endless supply, but orchid populations eventually dwindled to catastrophically low levels. “This project is well-matched to George Merrick’s dream of creating ‘a City that is a garden’,” said Coral Gables Mayor Jim Cason. “Our already beautiful green landscape will be simply stunning when the orchids are in full bloom.” On Earth Day 2014, the first orchids of the Million Orchid Project were planted at Merrick Park, across from City Hall.  Thanks to the partnership between the City of Coral Gables and Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, approximately 250,000 native orchids will be installed in various public green spaces , parks and roadway swales.

But it has never had the same sense of community as Coral Gables downtown, or the foot traffic driven by residents, workers, and visitors. Until now. The neighborhood surrounding the Shops is coming into its own. Known variously as the Village of Merrick Park or the Merrick Park District – and now being re-cast by the city as The Design & Innovation District – it is bound on the north by Bird Road, on the west by Le Jeune Road, on the east by Ponce de Leon Boulevard, and on the south by Ruiz Avenue and the Ponce extension. Once filled with industrial warehouses, auto repair shops, and the city’s storage area for heavy equipment, it is the new home of multiple residential mid-rises, a soon-to-open condo/hotel, world-class adult care centers, and a growing number of dining and retail options. It has become such a hot spot for new development that the New York Post ran a story last month about the “MPD” or Merrick Park District, entitled “Property investors think this industrial Miami nabe is about to blow up.” The lead photo for the article was a rendering of the Cassia Residences, the latest development to break ground. This condo of turnkey residences, each fully furnished, will clock in with one, two, and three-bedroom units of between 662 and 1,461 square feet each, with prices starting at $700,000. Occupancy is anticipated for 2027. “It’s an evolution in real estate. When the Shops at Merrick Park began to get more traction, I think the whole area started developing in the right direction.” Raimundo Onetto, above, CEO of Alta Developers Cassia – named after the pink blooming tree that can be found in the Gables – is the latest project by Raimundo Onetto, the CEO and principal of Alta Developers, who has brought 4,000 units to the South Florida market. Now, he too is betting on the Merrick Park area. Onetto says one of the keys to success for the project is pricing; another is the interior design work by IDDI and the furnishings by Restoration Hardware. Onetto himself is also an architect, and, inspired by a trip to Milan, he personally designed Cassia’s kitchens, which will be manufactured by Italkraft. “There are different pockets of Miami,” says Onetto. “Remember, there were no residential buildings in Brickell in 2001, so this part of Coral Gables is kind of the same thing. It’s an evolution in real estate. When The Shops at Merrick Park began to get more traction, I think the whole area started developing in the right direction.” Onetto’s building follows close on the heels of The Avenue, a Parisian-inspired condo hotel that is nearing completion. Oscar Roger, president and CEO of Roger Development Group, was instrumental in the development of the Merrick Park District. In 2005, he pushed through the zoning changes that allowed mixed-use buildings in the area. Then, in 2008 he built One Village Place at Salzedo and Altera, with 148 condos, and 28 retail spaces. When the developers of a planned 200-key hotel next to the Shops pulled out during the pandemic, Roger saw his opportunity. That was the genesis of the Avenue Hotel & Residences Coral Gables. Roger’s project will not have anywhere near 200 units. The Avenue’s building, designed by the architectural firm of Bermello Ajamil & Partners, will serve as a residential hideaway encompassing just 48 one- and two-bedroom footprints, measuring from 598 to 1,200-square-feet. There will be 18 one-bedroom units and 30 two-bedroom units, plus each living room will contain a sofa bed to welcome extended family. Roger anticipates a soft opening in July or August, with the grand opening to follow a few months later. With prices starting at $730,000, The Avenue is 90 percent sold. “This Was My Baby Years Ago, And Now I’m Back.” Oscar Roger, CEO of Roger Development Group, With His Son at The Shops at Merrick Park “Let me tell you why I truly believe that we have the right product,” Roger explains. “First of all, we have a boutique building. You spend the week in one of our units and you can bring your kids, and you can bring your in-laws, as opposed to the hotel concept, which is a studio or a bedroom for a businessman or a couple coming for a few days. Our residences are beautifully defined by [interior designer] Adriana Hoyos, and then you get to experience living right next to The Shops at Merrick Park in ‘The City Beautiful, Coral Gables. It doesn’t get any better than that.” Roger’s appreciation of the family dynamic for The Avenue reflects what is happening in the neighborhood as a whole – a diverse demographic that includes all age groups. On the far end of that spectrum is the advent of Belmont Village Senior Living Coral Gables, with more than 200 resident apartments set within a 10-story, 250,000-square-foot building. Patricia Will, the founder and CEO of Belmont Village, is partnering with Baptist Health South Florida to provide a state-of-the-art facility which resembles a college campus as much as high-end retirement community. In addition to cutting-edge medical capabilities, Belmont has everything from classrooms for music and art to movie screening rooms and a library. Will says the location couldn’t be better, crediting Baptist Health South Florida for finding it. “What a transformation,” she says “Activated retail, which comes naturally to Merrick Park, is something every shopping center aspires to, with an indoor/outdoor experience, outdoor paseos, restaurants, and events. And now this neighborhood has grown up around it. It’s the best of what city planning has to offer. To our residents and family members, Merrick Park is a natural draw. And our employees also take advantage of Merrick Park.” In the streets around Cassia, The Avenue, and Belmont -which join the Merrick House condominium and the Henry apartment buildings – signs of life include street level coffee shops, wellness spas, exercise studios, a student learning center, a dog product store, a dance studio, and, coming soon, a Bagel Emporium. Jewelers like Tresor and Santayana have set up shop. The neighborhood Bistro CafÃ© is already so popular it’s hard to grab a seat on weekend mornings. William Holly, the CEO of Patton Real Estate, has seen the area transform from its early days, when there was just the Shops at Merrick Park and the iconic 4000 Ponce Building on the corner of Bird Road and Ponce. Patton is the leasing agent for the building, which houses 130,000-square feet of class A office space and 30,000-square-feet of street retail space, in addition to the high-end Collection car dealership (Ferrari, Porsche, Audi, McLaren, Maserati, etc.). Like The Shops, it was built in 2002. “It’s like every overnight success story – it’s been building for 20 years,” says Holly.”It’s really becoming its own community.Coral Gables was the original live-work-play downtown, centered on Miracle Mile, but now in the Merrick District you have retail, condo, office, shopping, and restaurants. You now have a 24/7 community here.” Holly in particular notes the demographic spread.”You have, on a daily basis, people from toddlers to 20-somethings to octogenarians. It really is from babies to Boomers and beyond.” Again, the family dynamic that shaped The Avenues approach is also reflected at Cassia. It was originally slated to contain 174 units, but that number is shrinking as four or five families have decided to combine residences. Onetto says one buyer wanted to combine units to create a four-bedroom residence, noting that “there are not a lot of four- or five-bedroom units in the market.” He says the project is especially appealing to the parents of students at the University of Miami, who want to secure homes for their children. Left: Belmont Village Senior Living Coral Gables, with over 200 resident apartments. Right: The Collection car dealership for exotic supercar automobiles opened in 2002. “The inclusion of residential, particularly in the Merrick Park area, is really game-changing,” says Belkys Perez, director of the Economic Development Department for the City of Coral Gables. “If we want the district to be viable day and night, residential is crucial.” Perez notes that the district saw 1.3 million visitors last year, up from 1.1 million visitors in 2019. More importantly, she says that from 2019 to 2024, the number of residents in the district more than doubled, from 1,000 to 2,200. “Throughout the years, and especially after The Shops at Merrick Park was developed, [the area has] taken on a whole new life,” she says. “It’s really nice to see how the area has flourished.” Now, says Perez, the city wants to promote the area as a nexus for design and tech firms. Already; it is home to a variety of interior designers, as well as furniture and appliance outlets, from Ferguson (bath, kitchen and lighting), to Victoria’s Armoire (furniture), to Miele (appliances). “A few years ago, because we felt it had so much potential, through our planning review and zoning process, we changed its name to the Design and Innovation District,” says Perez, though that name has yet to get local traction. “For us, that means we still have a beautiful outdoor mall, we still have the shops and designers, but we also have a mix of home design stores, architecture firms, and engineering firms – broadly, the design realm,” she says. “And we also thought this would be a really good area for the innovation aspect as well.” Above: The Rooftop Leisure Area At Cassia Residences Raimundo Rodulfo, the city’s director of innovation and technology, says his department is prioritizing the area for high-tech connectivity with other areas of the Gables. “Our team is expanding the city’s fiber optic corridors to connect our Central Business District to the Innovation District and the Underline corridor. This foundation of high-speed communications will allow us to continue growing our Smart City infrastructure,” he says. This will provide hyperconnectivity for city services such as free public Wi-Fi, public safety systems, traffic and environmental sensors, smart mobility and connected transportation services, emergency management and response, and tech incubators. These, he says, will lay the groundwork for “community benefits for quality of life and economic opportunities.” On Altera Avenue, Street Level Retail Is Activating The Neighborhood Says Perez, “We’ve been laying fiber all the way from Alhambra down Ponce de Leon Boulevard, all the way down to the Design and Innovation District, to prepare it for the future growth in that area.” And what can we expect five years from now? “We anticipate seeing a lot more home and design stores,” Perez says. “[But] we’d love to see growth in the number of tech companies. Perhaps a partnership with a tech company is in the cards, with a floor for incubating startups.” But, as with any vision for bold advancement, nothing comes easily: “Finding the right partner – as well as finding the land is a challenge.” In the meantime, expect further growth in the number of residents, creating a vibrant and versatile community, set against the luxury backdrop of The Shops at Merrick Park, with tenants like David Yurman, Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Herman Miller, to name a few. The vision, says The Avenue’s Roger, is of pedestrian-friendly accessibility. “You can take an Uber from the airport, and you don’t have to rent a car,” he says. “You can just walk to a high-end restaurant or go shopping. The only physical amenity we offer is the rooftop pool – all the remaining amenities are surrounding it. And they are already built and done. It’s instant gratification.” Staying true to the concept that The Avenue should feel like it’s part of France’s quintessentially walkable city, Roger declined to create a parking plinth to rest the building upon. “At first, I wanted to put parking inside the building, but the buildings in Paris are not like that – they’re small buildings and they’re more boutique,” he says. Instead, The Avenue will have valet parking, with vehicles located across the street. The Shops At Merrick Park, With Tenants Like David Yurman, Carolina Herrera, Gucci, And Herman Miller Is Now Seeing The Inclusion Of Residential Buildings In This Eclectic Mix Roger’s efforts have even caught the attention of a pair of Parisian architects, who sought out the developer to contribute their expertise and ideas to a second Avenue, which is planned for Coral Gables Central Business District. In the meantime, Avenue will enjoy a social place in a special part of the city. ← A Store Worth Celebrating Cocktails, Dinner and a Show → Share This Post: Current Issue City Beautiful 1200 Anastasia Ave. Ste 115.

Some Moor History (Feb. 12, 2023) Completely enamored by the romanticism of Spanish culture, George Merrick wrapped his dreams of building a city with images of seductive Moorish architecture, spiced with the patina of a history lasting nearly 800 years on the Iberian Peninsula.

Shops at Merrick Park Shops at Merrick Park, Coral Gables’ premier destination for fine shopping and dining, has welcomed several new luxury retailers to its impressive retail lineup. Earlier this year, the popular destination welcomed designer shops Eden Park, Saya/Sitka Semsch, LensCrafters Specialty Optical and Eyewear and Sisu Clinic. This summer, Lafayette 148 and IMO Glow will open. “Shops at Merrick Park continues to be a top-tier location for shopping, dining and entertainment and we’re thrilled to welcome these sought after retailers,” said Carlos Limontes, senior general manager. “We invite residents and visitors to explore our newly expanded distinctive selection amidst beautiful streetscapes and lush surroundings.” Created in 1987 by Franck Mesnel, Eden Park’s high-end menswear takes its inspiration from sport, pioneering the transformation of rugby jerseys from the field of play to the streets of fashion. It mixes fabrics, shapes and patterns in unexpected ways, deconstructing silhouettes in order to rebuild its own unique version of an everyday style, at once comfortable, colorful and with French flair. Eden Park is located on the first level between lululemon and the future Lafayette 148. Saya/Sitka Semsch, now open on the first level between Neiman Marcus and Mayor’s, is an upscale womenswear and accessories store. The store features designs from original hand-knitted techniques such as macramé, horquilla and hand loom weaving. LensCrafters Specialty Optical & Eyewear, offering top eyewear brands and designers from New York to Milan, is situated on level two adjacent to Nordstrom. Sisu Clinic, a first-of-its-kind, doctor-led aesthetic clinic, opened in June. Sisu, known for its cutting-edge treatments, expert medical providers and first-class service, is located on the second level next to Neiman Marcus and Lovesac. Scheduled to open in mid-July, Lafayette 148 is located in the center courtyard next to Eden Park and Hugo Boss. Lafayette 148 is global lifestyle brand led by women, for women. Its ready-to-wear clothing, accessories and shoes offer uncompromising quality, luxurious materials, flawless construction and a modern, New York sensibility — hallmarks of its collections. IMO Glow (In My Opinion Certified Procedural Medicine and Aesthetic Dermatology) also is scheduled to be opening soon. This certified procedural medicine-led cosmetic practice, helmed by LeslieRohaidy, PA-C, AAOPM, focuses on natural and conservative cosmetic medical treatments. It will be located at the corner of Altara and Salzado. In addition to these anticipated arrivals, several tenants have relocated. Soler-Baillo Plastic Surgery will reopen in August in its new location on the third floor next to Gymboree. Retailer J. Crew Men’s can be found inside the main J. Crew store on the second level. Jimmy Choo has relocated across the courtyard next to Tempur-Pedic and Peloton while Vince has moved adjacent to Peloton and Madison Reed.
