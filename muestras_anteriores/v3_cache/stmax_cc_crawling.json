Thanks to the efforts of Father Michael J. McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary’s Church in New Haven and some of his parishioners, the Connecticut state legislature on March 29, 1882, officially chartered the Knights of Columbus as a fraternal benefit society. The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity. All the good works we do are informed by our four core principles: Charity - Our Catholic faith teaches us to “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” Members of the Knights of Columbus show love for their neighbors by conducting food drives and donating the food to local soup kitchens and food pantries, by volunteering at Special Olympics, and by supporting, both spiritually and materially, mothers who choose life for their babies. Knights recognize that our mission, and our faith in God, compels us to action. There is no better way to experience love and compassion than by helping those in need, a call we answer every day. Unity – None of us is as good as all of us. Members of the Knights of Columbus all know that – together – we can accomplish far more than any of us could individually. So we stick together…we support one another. That doesn’t mean that we always agree or that there is never a difference of opinion. It does mean that – as a Knight of Columbus – you can count on the support and encouragement of your brother Knights as you work to make life better in your parish and community. Fraternity – The Venerable Michael J. McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus, in large part, to provide assistance to the widows and children left behind when the family breadwinner died – often prematurely. The Order’s top-rated insurance program continues to do this today, as do individual Knights, who last year gave more than 10 million hours of their time to assist sick and/or disabled members and their families. In the Knights of Columbus, we watch out for and take care of one another. Patriotism – Members of the Knights of Columbus, be they Americans, Canadians, Mexicans, Cubans, Filipinos, Poles, or Dominicans, are patriotic citizens. We are proud of our devotion to God and country, and believe in standing up for both. Whether it’s in public or private, the Knights remind the world that Catholics support their nations and are amongst the greatest citizens.

St Maximillian is more than just childcare they become your family. We have been at this school since 2019, when my daughter turned two and have had an amazing experience from the beginning. Choosing a preschool can be daunting, but from the moment I toured this school I knew I had found a hidden gem. The staff is sincerely interested in providing a comfortable and nurturing environment. You can tell they absolutely love their job and treat your child as if they were their own. This school has always taken pride in cleanliness and safety. Currently my daughter is in the PK-4 class and at 4 years old my daughter was already learning to read. I attribute this to the academic curriculum, teachers experience and abilities the entire team has. Wonderful facility and teachers but most of all thoughtful people that are a very important part of my daughter's life. She adores this school. We would recommend this pre-school without any hesitation. They will forever be part of our family! I've been a speech therapist seeing children at this school for nearly 8 years and a parent of a preschooler here for 3 years. The school is small. Classrooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. The staff is well prepared, kind, caring, patient and loving. You can tell that they love what they do. I've been seeing the same staff there for years. No high turnover like most preschools. Their approach is developmentally appropriate and children receive a well rounded education that prepares them for kindergarten academically, socially and emotionally. My daughter has loved every single one of her teachers and so have I. I cannot think of a better place for a young child to learn and grow. Absolutely a very great pre school! Teachers and staff are all loving, attentive, and care very much for the children. My kids have been going there since they were 2 and they are very happy to be there. We all love it very much! So glad our friends told us about this preschool. Our daughter has excelled in so many different areas. We are beyond grateful and blessed to be a part of this family. The teachers are extremely kind and loving with our 4 yo daughter. Mrs. Hibbard, the director is very professional and works with you depending on your child’s needs. Thank you for all that you guys do for our family! St Max ha sido otra familia para mi. Mis 4 hijos fueron a esta escuela donde a parte de amor, les dieron la mejor educación académica. Son 8 años q conozco St Max, sus maestras y su programa de educación. Safe environment, clean, organized, and loving staff. I wish they would have elementary, middle, and high school. Don’t think too much, St Max is the best preschool for your kids. I couldn't have been happier with this pre-school. My 3 sons graduated from St. Max. so we were there for 6 years in total. I love all the staff; teachers are the bests and the environment is loving, caring, clean and safe. Is time to leave and definitely we will miss them next year. I really recommend this school.

Churches are generally vulnerable because we are in the business of helping people. This makes it harder to say 'no' when a scammer poses as a priest asking for help. The majority of victims tend to be elderly who are hesitant to report the crimes. All our requests for donations are made from the pulpit or printed on our church bulletin. A good rule of thumb in scams is that if something doesn’t feel right, it’s probably not. An easy to way to confirm is to call the church and speak with someone who you know works here.

What is the Sacrament of Reconciliation? Reconciled to Right Relationship, Called to Heal and Restore The Sacrament of Penance is an experience of the gift of God's boundless mercy. Not only does it free us from our sins but it also challenges us to have the same kind of compassion and forgiveness for those who sin against us. We are liberated to be forgivers. We obtain new insight into the words of the Prayer of St. Francis: \"It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.\" Jesus entrusted the ministry of reconciliation to the Church. The Sacrament of Penance is God's gift to us so that any sin committed after Baptism can be forgiven. In confession we have the opportunity to repent and recover the grace of friendship with God. It is a holy moment in which we place ourselves in his presence and honestly acknowledge our sins, especially mortal sins. With absolution, we are reconciled to God and the Church. The Sacrament helps us stay close to the truth that we cannot live without God. \"In him we live and move and have our being\" (Acts 17:28). While all the Sacraments bring us an experience of the mercy that comes from Christ's dying and rising, it is the Sacrament of Reconciliation that is the unique Sacrament of mercy. -From the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults \"Lastly, there is the [priest's] power of forgiveness. The Sacrament of Penance is one of the Church's precious treasures, since authentic world renewal is accomplished only through forgiveness. Nothing can improve the world if evil is not overcome. Evil can be overcome only by forgiveness. Certainly, it must be an effective forgiveness; but only the Lord can give us this forgiveness, a forgiveness that drives away evil not only with words but truly destroys it. Only suffering can bring this about and it has truly taken place with the suffering love of Christ, from whom we draw the power to forgive.\" — Pope Benedict XVI, Homily at Pentecost Mass for Priestly Ordination, May 15, 2005. -From A Year with Pope Benedict, XVI, © Libreria Editrice Vaticana.

The St. Max Youth Ministry is committed to bringing the most faithful and innovative methods for youth to be integrated into parish life. We seek to combine elements of Catholic theology, service, spirituality, scripture, and the arts into vibrant social settings. Our goal is the continued forming of a young Christian community within the parish whereby adolescents can grow in their love of God and neighbor (ref. Matthew 22:36-40). The ministry is designed to show youth the importance of a 'Christ centered life.’ It is a furthering of their Catholic faith within middle school and high school, stressing such vital components as Christian discipleship, faith sharing, scripture, sacramental devotion, fellowship, forgiveness and reconciliation, and youth integration at the parish level. We seek to be a healthy, faithful, and safe environment for all involved wherein we witness to the source of our joy, namely Jesus the Christ and His Blessed Church.

Registration Forms 2024-2025 Policies and Procedures 2024-2025 RCIA Adult Registration Packet Documents Archdiocesan Anti Bullying Policy Religious Education Religious Education /Faith Formation for Children St. Maximilian Kolbe Religious Education Classes for students in 1 st Grade – 8 th Grade are held weekly on either Sunday 10:45 am – Noon, Tuesday 5:15 pm – 6:30 pm, or  Wednesday 6 pm – 7:15 pm from September through May. Our Mission is to assist parents in passing on their Catholic faith to their children. Your son / daughter is important to us. We offer classes for continuous faith formation and full sacramental initiation for all grades. This is accomplished through age appropriate experiences and instruction, which build a community of faith, both within the religious education program and our St. Max worshipping community. Our program respects the individual child, provides personal support, and encourages a sense of belonging for each child. We help families to live out their Catholic faith by encouraging them to pray with their children, attend weekly mass together, participate in parish activities, help the poor, contribute to the financial support of the parish, and to generally be a good role model of Catholic faith. Religious Education Curriculum: Our continuous education program uses grade-level curriculum.  Key topics of our Catholic faith are introduced at each grade level. The lessons prompt children to relate the knowledge of the faith to their own life experiences, as we live, worship, and serve together. Sacrament Preparation (2nd – 8th grade): Sacrament preparation is a two year process. For families on the traditional path of having their child baptized before they turn 7 years old, we offer a two year preparation for First Holy Communion beginning in First Grade/ Year 1 Communion. During the second year of preparation the child will receive the Sacraments of First Reconciliation and First Communion. For those families not on the traditional path, we offer classes for older children (over 7 years old), who were baptized, but have not yet received their First Communion.  These older children prepare for the sacraments with other older students. Sacrament Preparation (2nd – 8th grade): For children who have never been baptized and are 7 years or older, we offer a Children Catechumenate journey of faith based on the Rite of Christian Initiation Adapted for Children (RCIA) . In Year 1 they are placed in an age appropriate class with their peers. During Year 2 they attend our Sunday Session to prepare for the Sacraments of Baptism and First Communion. Both sacraments are received during the Easter Vigil Mass. Confirmation Preparation for Children: We offer Confirmation Preparation for 7th and 8th grade students, who wish to deepen their faith, and participate more fully within the parish community. This two consecutive year process includes weekly classes, Nights of Reflection, and participation in community service projects. Year 2 Confirmation candidates, who have shown readiness and a desire to receive, will receive the Sacrament of Confirmation, when the Bishop comes to St. Maximilian Kolbe. High School Sacramental Preparation: For students currently enrolled in High School we offer a preparation for sacraments through the RCIA High School process. Volunteer Opportunities: Our Religious Education program exists because of our dedicated team of volunteers.  At every session volunteer opportunities exist for adults. Our adult Catechists and Assistant Catechists commit their time and talent each week to assist families in furthering a Catholic identity.  Some volunteers have or have had children in the Religious Education program, and some do not.  We offer training for our catechetical teams at both the parish and archdiocesan levels.  Other volunteer opportunities are in the Religious Education Office, on the Safety Team, Arts and Crafts Committee, or with special events. High School Teen Assistants: High School students, who have received the Sacrament of Confirmation, undergo an application process to be selected as a volunteer. They are assigned as a classroom Teen Assistant, to the RE Office, or to the Arts and Crafts Committee, or help at special events.  These students have a desire to continue their Catholic faith, show leadership, and share the love of Christ with others. All volunteers must comply with the Archdiocese of Miami Safe Environment guidelines. Volunteers are the heart of Catholic ministry.
