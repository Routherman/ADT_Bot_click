Florida Folk musicians came from all over Central Florida to perform and raise funds to help Green, one of their own. Green, who turns 49 on Aug. 13, has been bedridden, being kept alive on a feeding tube and IV fluids, suffering from numerous incurable conditions, some caused by the black mold-infested home she lives in with her 80-year-old mother. She has been trying to raise enough money to get herself and her mother into a safe living situation. Prior to her illnesses, Green regularly wrote, played and performed folk music and was a regular at Florida Folk festivals and events. Although weak, on Sunday Green was able to perform a song she had written, “Book of Dreams,” singing and playing on her red Ibanez guitar, which she had donated to auction off at the event. “I’m very honored and very thankful to be here,” she said. “God is good.” The event, which was originally going to be outdoors, was moved inside the restaurant, and it was difficult to tell who had come specifically for the event and who were surprised by the day’s entertainment when they stopped in for wings. At the end of the day, the event raised $1,065, which will be turned over to the United Way of Citrus County on Green’s behalf. As of Monday, Aug. 7, Green’s GoFundMe account at www.gofundme.com/f/KellyGreensMiracle has raised $12,519. On the GoFundMe page, Green’s mom, Irene Green recently wrote: “We are in the process of securing temporary housing for Kelly and myself by using the funds you so generously donated. The black mold home will be demolished! We will stay in the temporary housing until our new home is found and placed as more funds allow. “This is so exciting. We are starting to pack! We will also be securing a storage space for some of our belongings. We are gathering a team of amazing volunteers! “The United Way of Citrus County is still accepting donations on our behalf. We do not know the names of all those who donated, but God knows your name. They (United Way) have collected almost $6,000 and they told me checks are still coming in! God is good.” To donate, make checks payable to United Way of Citrus County and write “Irene Green” in the memo line. Mail a check or drop it off at the United Way office at 1582 N. Meadowcrest Blvd., Crystal River, FL 34429. “We are expecting more answered prayers,” Irene Green said. “I believe we will reach our goal of getting a home for Kelly and myself.” Nancy Kennedy can be reached at 352-564-2927 or by email at nkennedy@chronicleonline.com .

She is donating this guitar as a raffle prize at “Crackerstock for Kelly” fundraising folk music event Aug. 6 at The Cove Resort and Pub in Inverness. Special to the Chronicle Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The Cove Resort and Pub in Inverness and the organizers of the “Crackerstock for Kelly” Florida folk music event are gearing up for a “real Florida” fun time Sunday, Aug. 6. A few of the details have changed, but not the purpose: to raise funds to benefit Kelly Green, the Crystal River woman with multiple debilitating illnesses who needs a safe home instead of the black mold-infested home she lives in with her 80-year-old mother. Prior to her illnesses, Kelly Green regularly wrote, played and performed folk music. She hopes to be strong enough to come to the Crackerstock event and even hopes to play with her folk music friends. The Crackerstock event, now from 2 to 7 p.m. will be on the patio at The Cove. “We will have our full menu available, plus the use of our bathrooms, and in case of rain, we can move everything inside the restaurant,” said Kemper Willcut, co-owner of The Cove Resort and Pub with his wife, Lou Ann Jacobs. The Cove Resort and Pub is at 1242 S. Cove Point in Inverness, off State Road 44 East, 2.5 miles west from the intersection of State Road 44 and U.S. 41. Look for the Dollar General store at 44 and South Cove Point and follow the road lined with American flags that leads to The Cove. Phone: 352-344-5894. Lots of free parking available. Admission is free. Event organizer, Goody Haines, said there will be lots of raffles in between musical sets for “some really good stuff,” including gift baskets, a quilt, carved wood pieces, “some big-ticket items,” and one of Kelly Green’s guitars, a red Ibanez. Florida Humanities describes Florida folk music as “elusive and eclectic,” from “blues to cowboy crooning, from backwoods banjo playing, gospel choir, finger-style guitarists and sacred steel players to piano mavens playing Joplin, and bluegrass jams.” The musical lineup for Sunday’s Crackerstock for Kelly: 2-2:30 p.m. Lisa Thomas with Dora Ann. Lisa is the widow of Frank Thomas who was a Florida Folk Heritage Award recipient and the writer of such notable songs as “The Cracker Cowman.” Lisa has continued bringing Frank’s music to the Florida musical community. 2:40-3:40 p.m. Wry Whiskey Band. Wry Whiskey Band has been playing bluegrass music for more than 20 years at every major venue in Florida and Georgia. Ed Wybranowski is the banjo man and daughter Christy keeps everybody in line with the standup bass. Harry Trott’s guitar work blends the music together while good friends Ann Osborne and John Skolberg fill out their musical picture. 4-4:30 p.m. Back in Tyme. MaryLee and Frank Sweet have spent decades presenting “old-tyme” songs and history to festivals all over. Their storytelling and songs weave a wonderful tapestry of imagery that will take you Back In Tyme! 5:10-5:40 p.m. VGO. Here is a gentleman who can play any style of music and keep you mesmerized with his talent and musical skills. VGO is world traveled and he spent a number of years as a member of the 97th Regimental String Band. 6-7 p.m. Hapi McKenzie and the Crabgrass Cowboys. Hapi McKenzie and Patty Pfister show the way Country, Rockabilly, Americana, Bluegrass ought to be played! Their music is a down-home mixture of folk, Florida, swingish cowboy music a la Hank Williams or Asleep at the Wheel, and the cosmic country of Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris. Like Bob Will’s music, many of the tunes have a hillbilly swing feel straight out of the thirties. 7 p.m. Silent Auction Winners announced. On her Facebook page, Kelly Green, who turns 49 on Aug. 13, said her birthday wish is for people to support this event. “If you are not able to come, we ask that you please show your support for our cause online,” she wrote. “Please make a donation if your heart and finances allow and/or share the GoFundMe link https://tinyurl.com/ 7x7faz35 on your social media accounts. Please tell your friends about this and ask them to share. We humbly ask for help.” Green has been bedridden, being kept alive on a feeding tube and IV fluids, suffering from numerous incurable conditions. She added, “(We) are in the process of using the GoFundMe donations to secure temporary housing for (me and my elderly mom). God is so good and by your love and support we will do this! Thank you, to everyone for your support.” Nancy Kennedy can be reached at 352-564-2927 or by email at nkennedy@chronicleonline.com .

Recently, The Cove Resort & Pub was named by Southern Living as the top Hidden Gem in North America in the 2025 Camp Spot Awards. Special to the Chronicle For locals in Citrus County, The Cove’s hot wings and cold beer have been longtime favorites, but now this out-of-the-way spot has gotten nationwide recognition as a resort and campground. In April, Southern Living named The Cove Resort & Pub in Inverness as the top Hidden Gem in North America in the 2025 Camp Spot Awards. The Cove’s Love Shack sits next to the Tin Roof Cabin as part of The Cove Resort & Pub in Inverness. Special to the Chronicle On the magazine’s website, southernliving.com , they wrote: “Set in scenic Citrus County, The Cove sits along the shimmering Tsala Apopka Lake, surrounded by trees and laid-back waterfront views. It’s just a short drive from Crystal River – home to Florida’s famous manatees – and offers direct access to the 46-mile Withlacoochee State Trail, making it a perfect basecamp for outdoor adventure and wildlife encounters. “But location is just part of the draw. With cozy cabins, 10 landscaped RV sites, a full-service pub, live music on weekends, nearby airboat tours, and kayak and paddleboard rentals, The Cove has quietly built a devoted following over the years. Now, it’s earned national recognition for its unique blend of charm, convenience, and community.” Lou Ann Jacobs, owner of The Cove Resort & Pub, and Teresa “Tee” Zaccardi, manager/”director of chaos.” Nancy Kennedy / Chronicle Reporter It came as a complete surprise to owners Lou Ann Jacobs and Kemper Willcut, and to Cove manager/”director of chaos” Teresa “Tee” Zaccardi, who handles all the bookings for the campground and Airbnb rentals. “We were getting calls with people saying, ‘I saw the article,’ and we didn’t know what they were talking about,” Zaccardi said. “At 6 a.m. I got an Airbnb call and they said, ‘I saw the article,’ so, I looked up ‘The Cove’ (online) and started scrolling and saw Southern Living and saw a picture of our Love Shack (rental). “So, I sent it to Kemper and Lou Ann and posted the article on our Facebook page, and about two hours later the phone started blowing up,” she said. “That day alone we got 33 bookings, all from the article.” Within four days, they had 85 bookings. The Point House, part of The Cove Resort & Pub in Inverness, sits on the banks of Lake Henderson among the trees. Special to the Chronicle “What amazes me,” Jacobs said, “nobody said a thing to us. If someone came out (to take notes), we didn’t know. So, it was a complete surprise. Then, after Southern Living, Travel & Leisure picked up the article, and MSN actually did their own, which was really nicely done. “This is really a big deal for us,” she said. “We have bookings into February.” Citrus County Tourism Director Auvis Cole said what makes this recognition so much more meaningful is that nobody voted on this. “It wasn’t where you send out a bunch of emails and ask people to vote for you, and you can vote 10 times a day. This was based on reviews from people who have stayed here,” he said. The Cove is at 1242 S. Cove Camp Point in Inverness, off Gulf to Lake Highway. Special to the Chronicle Jacobs said that when they acquired The Cove in 2016, which was just the restaurant at the time, they had a vision of what they wanted to do. They told the Chronicle in 2016 that when they had first moved to Citrus County in 2011, The Cove was the first place they stopped. They looked around at the iconic decor and the idyllic setting by the water and said to each other, “If only we could own this place someday.” The former Cove owners, Casey and Robin Wells, closed the restaurant in July 2016 because of Robin’s health, and Jacobs and Willcut bought it in August. Slowly they’ve worked on the property until it’s what it is today – and they’re not finished. Two of three original fish shacks from the days when The Cove was a simple fish camp have been converted into 400-square-foot modernized, cozy cabins – the Love Shack and Tin Roof Cabin. Plus, they have the two-bedroom Point House that’s located right on Lake Henderson, Swampwater Farm house that sleeps six and the Founder’s Lodge, a customized home with two master suites and its own private swimming pool. Also, they have 10 premium RV campsites and an outdoor pole barn/pavilion out under the trees that is used for weddings and events. “It’s been a labor of love,” Jacobs said.
