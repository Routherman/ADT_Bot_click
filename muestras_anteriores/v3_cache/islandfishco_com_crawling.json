Directors must stand for re-election every three years.  Any of our members may be nominated to stand for election to the Board of Directors; if you would like to be considered for election, please contact the current OATA Chairman or find out more about what’s involved here . Laura Carlin Chair My experience covers a variety of sectors within the trade spanning the past 20 years and I have the grey hairs to prove it.  Initially I worked for a large multi-site chain whilst studying for my BSc in Marine Biology, then a public aquarium, a wholesaler/importer and lastly in independent aquatics store before setting up my own wholesale company, EcoMarines.  EcoMarines is driven by nothing other than my pure passion to improve our trade by focusing on sustainability and ethics.  Part of this has seen me work extensively on shutting down illegal coral imports, producing documents alongside OATA to help authorities spot and act on ‘fake mariculture’ as well as tirelessly working with exporters and like-minded companies on improving sourcing, quarantine procedures and shipping strategies. Dr Donna Snellgrove Incoming Vice Chair Dr Donna Snellgrove is the manager of the fish team at WALTHAM, the centre for pet research which is part of Mars Petcare. Donna has a BSc degree in biological sciences specialising in marine biology from the University of Plymouth, which she followed with an MSc in biological research methods from Exeter University.  She then returned to Plymouth to do a PhD in fish nutrition and physiology. Her research, sponsored by an Aquafeed company, investigated the availability and fate of minerals from various raw materials in diets for production rainbow trout.  Her post-doctoral research based at the University of Connecticut (US), involved culturing seaweed ( Porphyra sp.) for use in integrated aquaculture systems. www.waltham.com Matt Stevenson Outgoing Vice Chair I studied engineering specialising in aquarium filtration, gaining a 1st class degree. Previously I have been involved in helping many NGOs ranging from the National Lobster hatchery in Padstow, to Coral Awareness Projects. With a strong understanding of marketing, I am well aware of brand and modern communication technologies. Through my career, I have always been in the aquatic market segment and close to the retail trade. Using my knowledge and entrepreneurial flair to start biOrb aquarium in 1999. A strong believer in animal welfare I have more recently started Seneye who provide unique internet monitoring systems for aquatic welfare. My aim has always been to try and increase the numbers of fish keepers in the UK. I have kept fish since a small child and currently have a Koi pond along with Marine and tropical aquariums. I am also a keen surfer, diver, and motorcyclist combining these where possible with his passion for travel. www.seneye.com Rob Edgecock With his first job as a ‘fish importer’, Robert has been in the aquatic import and distribution business for twenty years. In 1999, Robert founded Independent Aquatic Imports Ltd with business partner Annie Biggerstaff and they are both as passionate about the business now as they were then. The company imports and distributes ornamental fish and aquatic plants across the UK. Married with three children, Robert enjoys relaxing with family and friends and the odd round of golf. “I joined OATA to offer my services and experience to assist the trade not only in matters directly relevant to our day to day business but also the whole trade.” www.aquaticimports.com Caroline Everett Caroline Everett runs Anglo Aquatic Plant Co Ltd, based in Enfield, Middlesex. She was born into the aquatics industry, as her parents, David and Rosalind, founded Anglo Aquatic plant (formerly Anglo Aquarium) over 50 years ago. She has been involved in the business from a very early age. After university, she worked at Mars confectionery, designing and building production lines, but returned to the family business in 2009. Using her knowledge and experience from the corporate world, she has taken Anglo from strength to strength, focusing on quality products and customer service. She has immense knowledge in aquatic plants and is regularly called upon to advise retailers, landscapers and consultants. She frequently hosts Capel Manor students at Anglo to enhance their knowledge of aquatics. www.angloaquatic.co.uk Jeremy Gay Jeremy is well known within the industry, having edited Practical Fishkeeping and more recently Reefbuilders.com. “Fishkeeping has been my passion for forty years – it is how I’ve earned a living for the last 25 years, and I want the aquatics industry to both survive and thrive so that I can continue my hobby as I always have done, (as well as my career). “OATA is the best way to make our voices heard right up to Government Department levels – the kind of levels that can have a huge impact on the ornamental aquatic trade as we know it. “I want to align with the Captains’ of our industry so that we are best equipped to deal with whatever threats are thrown at us, from legislation to regulation, and I want to do the best job I can to ensure high standards of welfare are maintained at all times. “Fishkeeping is more than just a hobby to me. It’s my life.” Neil Hardy Neil Hardy is a founder member of OATA, a member of the board and has served on a variety of sub-committees. He has 40 years experience of the aquatics industry having started out in his father’s company in his early teens.

With 35 years of experience in the aquatic industry, he’s delved into various aspects of the trade, from retail to wholesale livestock/dry goods and e-commerce. Part of Phil’s career was spent as the CEO of The Pet Shop, the largest online pet retailer in the GCC and MENA regions, based in Dubai, UAE. Upon returning to the UK, he took on the role of Managing Director at KKC Ltd, a wholesaler specializing in marine livestock. As well as this, he also assumed the position of CEO at Swell UK Ltd, the UK’s largest online retailer for aquatic and reptile products. With his extensive experience in the aquatic industry, Phil is eager to give back to the trade. What better way to do so than by serving as a board member on OATA. www.kkcltd.co.uk www.swelluk.com Simon Langdale Simon Langdale is a partner and director of Maidenhead Aquatics and has personally kept fish for almost 30 years. With over 100 stores nationwide Maidenhead Aquatics is one of largest UK retailers of livestock, plants and all aquatic hardware necessary for fishkeeping both in and outdoors. The success of these stores has been built on livestock expertise, high quality aquatic products and outstanding customer service. Simon’s role in the business now takes him worldwide sourcing ethical and sustainable livestock and innovative products to benefit the welfare of livestock and enhance the fishkeeping experience. Simon’s been a member of OATA for many years now and regards the role as vital to promote & protect the trade, to ensure standards of livestock welfare through the UK and identify and address issues within the aquatic industry, representing businesses on their behalf. www.fishkeeper.co.uk Philip Lawton Our family run business Kidsgrove Tropical’s and Water Garden Centre opened in 1983 and has been a member of OATA Since its founding in 1991. I have passed both OATA Advanced diplomas and enjoyed the studying aspect which was required for these courses. Having these diplomas has also assisted my further knowledge which has been helpful to enable me to inform my customers with good quality advice and customer service. Since we began trading in 1983 I have worked in all aspects of this trade from retail sales, stock control, preparing the necessary book work which is required. As a small independent retailer established in this industry for over 30 years I believe I can assist and encourage other smaller retailers to the board to make them aware of OATA and what they have to offer and I am committed to help the association in any way to help safeguard our members and the industry. I bring forward the views and opinions of the smaller independent bricks and mortar retail stores to the board to help secure the future of the aquatic industry. I’ve also worked with OATA towards tackling the inconsistency of local authorities issuing pet licenses throughout the United Kingdom. My hobbies include gardening and after all these years I am still a keen aquarist with a special interest in aquatic gardening and custom built aquarium installations. http://www.kidsgrovetropicals.co.uk/ Rob Peck Rob set up and manages The Coral Centre, a coral farming facility/retail store that also undertake scientific research for coral growth and reef restoration, bridging the gap between hobbyist and scientist.  “I have a real passion to make a difference in the hobby, as we get a better understanding of fish keeping and the impact this can have on the environment. My background is retail marketing and customer experience, learning the trade in the DIY industry, before moving into the aquatic trade. I’m keen to use these skills to help support the delivery of tools that’ll help traders deliver a high standard of customer experience within their shops and online stores. Outside of the trade, I’m a keen marine keeper and avid sports fan.” www.thecoralcentre.co.uk Max Pedley Max Pedley runs Ornamental Aquatics Wholesale. He has eight years of experience working in the aquatic trade, starting in retail positions before moving into an instructor/technician role in the education sector before becoming a Director at Ornamental Aquatics Wholesale. “I became a Director of OATA because I feel I can help the industry with my unique outlook and ‘boots on the ground’ approach to the trade. As a very passionate and active member of the freshwater hobby side of the industry, I also hope to bridge the gap between professionals and hobbyists. I look forward to working with other directors to help overcome challenges the trade faces.” Brian Schaff Brian has over 18 years of experience in the industry with its roots in marine ornamental aquaculture leading to various world firsts in rearing species at commercial scale. Over the years he has developed his experience from managing various departments in the business over various countries and various roles in other trade associations specifically in the Iberian peninsula (AEDPAC and APCPAC). Brian is now a partner and director for TMC. “As Managing Director of Tropical Marine Centre, I have responsiblity for the entire worldwide operations of our centres of excellence in fish as well as their supply lines and customer base, ensuring that TMC upholds its position as Europe’s leading supplier of the highest quality, ethically-sourced marine livestock to the trade.” www.tropicalmarinecentre.com Mark Smith Mark has 25 years’ experience within the pet trade, specialising in aquatics and reptile for the most part. He has been employed with Pets at Home for 22 years, starting in store, moving then to a field sales and welfare role combined. His current role is Pet Welfare Manager for the business. He has a bachelor’s degree in biology and a master’s in environmental sciences, with particular specialisation in introduced freshwater fauna. He has also kept fish for more than 35 years and still has fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates at home, and has a particular interest for the less commonly kept ‘oddball’ species. Maurits van de Pol On the 1st December 1994 I started as a sales representative for Rob’s Shop Services, also known as Dutch Aquarium Supplies, selling tropical plants in the Netherlands. Over the years, Rob’s Shop Services has grown into one of the market leaders in the aquatics trade in Europe and the UK. In 2008 my family and I moved to the UK where I was  managing Aquadistri UK Ltd. I can communicate in several different languages and I have vast experience in Brexit matters both on the products as well as on the live food and ornamental plant sides. I look forward to working closely together with the other directors to tackle the various challenges we face and will face over the next few years.

We stopped in around noon time for some lunch. We ordered 3 simple lunch items. The Key Shrimp Quesadilla was delicious as was the Key Shrimp Taco Platter. The   Lobster Bisque, however, was a hit as it was thick, creamy, and loaded with chunks of fresh lobster meat.  The Shrimp Tacos were hands down the best that I have EVER had. The menu was reasonably priced and the service was excellent especially when you consider that we are still enduring Covid-19 rules at this time. Our table and immediate seating area were spotlessly clean. Our hostess was prompt, and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and preparation of the good eats and just all-around nice. Our meals were delivered promptly. We highly recommend it and would absolutely go back. Truly an amazing culinary experience!
