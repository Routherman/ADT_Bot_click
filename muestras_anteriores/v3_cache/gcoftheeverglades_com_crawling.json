When she moved to Stuart, FL in 2015 to be a photojournalist at TCPalm and Treasure Coast Newspapers, she was able to make a career using her lifelong love for photography and a strong desire for justice. After meeting some of Florida's iconic environmentalists like Maggy Hurchalla and Nathaniel Reed and interviewing many other local naturalists, Leah knew she wanted to join their efforts in impacting Florida for the better. Becoming a Friend of the Everglades provides that opportunity every single day. leah.voss@everglades.org Advisors Ed Boland Development Advisor Ed first experienced the wonder of the Everglades as a five-year old on an airboat ride during a winter vacation and has been fascinated by tropical ecology ever since.
