At The Eagle Group, we look beyond just houses, offices and resorts, driven by a vision to bring the places we develop to life and create communities and environments that exceed expectations. This vision has remained consistent and clear for over 30 years. Ron Reeser Managing Partner, Founder Under Ron’s leadership, The Eagle Group continues to grow and diversify its portfolio, including high-profile developments in St. Kitts, Pensacola and several mining operations. He has held positions of founder, chairman, chief executive officer and principal stockholder in companies operating in real estate, acquisition, entitlement and financing, construction, mining development and marketing. Contact Ron Neil Paine Chief Financial Officer Neil provides financial oversight and governance for The Eagle Group’s portfolio of investments and developments. Neil is passionate about ensuring all projects have strong leadership and solid execution plans to win in their markets and to deliver forecasted returns. Prior to joining The Eagle Group, Neil was an executive responsible for the rollout of gigabit speed internet across the country and oversaw the product strategy and operations for one of the largest cable companies in the world. Prior to that, Neil worked as a strategy consultant with a focus on finance and Capex strategy in telecommunications, media and technology. In his capacity as a consultant, Neil has advised telecommunications companies, venture capital groups, startups in various sectors, microfinance banks and federal agencies. Contact Neil R.T. Edwards Director of Marketing In his present capacity with The Eagle Group, R.T. provides marketing and business planning support for the company’s real estate and mining development. He performs an important role in developing the master plan for The Eagle Group’s premier real estate development, Jubilee, a mixed-use golf course community near Pensacola, Florida, where he has relocated. An avid golfer with established relationships in the country club and city club management industry, R.T. is actively involved in building strategic alliances and promoting Jubilee’s championship golf course, exceptional clubhouse amenities and superlative lifestyle community. Prior to joining The Eagle Group, R.T. held senior sales and marketing roles with global technology companies, particularly those with a focus in the resources sector, including oil & gas, mining and utilities. His sales leadership, entrepreneurial, team-building and communication skills were brought to bear in founding and running successfully, for seven years, a software provider in the midstream and downstream oil & gas space. Contact R.T. Charles Lawshe Investor Relations Manager In his role as Investor Relations Manager, Charles works closely with CEO Ron Reeser and all Eagle Group investors in each business segment. Charles provides advisory services to Jubilee Investment Managers, LLC in their takeover and development of the highly anticipated Master-planned Community, “Jubilee”, in Santa Rosa County near Pensacola. He has also assisted the partnership in establishing HOA sub-associations and document preparation. Other Jubilee activities are coordinating with the Army Corps of Engineers and the state’s Department of Environmental Protection for compliance and ongoing monitoring related to wetlands damage from previous ownership. From his many years of working with investors of all types and backgrounds, Charles has perfected the skills and processes required to effectively communicate with both the investor and regulatory communities. Contact Charles Mike Cook Head of Operations Mike is the Head of Operations for The Eagle Group.  He is no stranger to orchestrating moving pieces in a dynamic environment. In fact, Mike excels in such an environment. Our Head of Operations is not only a talented businessman, he is also a Hall of Fame Quarterback for William & Mary as well as enjoying a brief stint as a professional football player. When asked about the similarities in business to running an offense, Mike replied, “Certainly, there are similarities. As a quarterback, it was critical to properly assess each situation, often in a very dynamic environment and to make decisions based on these observations and assessments. Business is very similar in the fact that change is rapid and you must be able to adjust quickly and correctly. This is especially true in operations. And just as in football, it is crucial to get your entire team aligned. I believe it’s the team aspect in business that is most similar and that I enjoy the most in my role.” Contact Mike Robyn Crossley Controller As Controller, Robyn is responsible for all accounting-related activities for The Eagle Group. She works diligently to prepare financial reports, budgets, and financial statements to ensure the Eagle team is well equipped to make informed business decisions on a daily basis. Robyn is a Certified Public Accountant in Virginia as well as a Chartered Global Management Accountant. She holds a Green Belt certification in Lean Six Sigma process improvement, which she utilizes to eliminate inefficiencies and improve work processes across The Eagle Group portfolio.

A History of Golf and Community Argyle Country Club was founded on the belief that golf should be welcoming, accessible, and family-friendly—a place where working families could build a community and enjoy the game without the formality of a traditional country club. Founded in 1923, Argyle started as a small club in Washington, DC, before relocating to Sligo Creek Golf Course in Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1945, Argyle moved again to its current 150-acre property, which was originally a working dairy farm. The old barn was converted into a clubhouse, and members came together to help shape the course and facilities. Through the years, Argyle has expanded and improved while staying true to its roots—a club where championship golf and genuine camaraderie come first. Today, with over 500 member families, Argyle remains a welcoming, family-friendly community with a passion for the game. Meet the Argyle Team Behind every exceptional club is a dedicated team of professionals who bring passion, experience, and a commitment to excellence. At Argyle, our leadership ensures that every round of golf, tennis match, and club gathering is an experience to remember.

The board meets monthly to discuss budgets, events and other news about the fight against childhood brain cancer. The expert guidance of our volunteer board consistently drives Team Jack to new heights. Rex Burkhead Rex Burkhead is a retired running back of the National Football League. Originally drafted by Cincinnati in the sixth round (190th overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft, Burkhead spent four seasons with the New England Patriots, before signing with the Texans prior to the 2021 season. He was a key offensive contributor each season for the Patriots and was a member of the Patriots 2018 Super Championship team, scoring the last two touchdowns during the thrilling overtime AFC Championship against the Kansas City Chiefs. Burkhead played college football at the University of Nebraska, which is where his story with Team Jack began. Rex has played an important part to the development and ongoing success of the Team Jack Foundation. Not only does Burkhead serve as a board member on the Foundation’s board of directors, but he was instrumental in the Foundation’s inception itself. Team Jack was formed to raise funds for pediatric brain cancer research. Its namesake is Jack Hoffman, a 18-year-old from Nebraska who has been battling the disease for most of his life. Hoffman and Burkhead formed an unlikely friendship when Burkhead was a star player at Nebraska that has continued to this day. Hoffman even won a “Best Moment” ESPY award when he entered Nebraska’s 2013 spring game and scored a 69-yard touchdown while sporting No. 22, Burkhead’s number during his college days. The two even met President Barack Obama together at the White House in 2013. Rex is from Plano, TX, where he currently resides with this wife, Danielle, and two sons, Jett and Steel. Karen Carson Karen Carson is a Co-founder of Fat Brain Toys, a retailer and manufacturer of educational toys and games. Karen’s introduction to the toy industry came about at the suggestion of her then 10-year old son, Adam. In the Fall of 2002, after finding it difficult to locate specialty toys online, her son suggested that she and her husband Mark build their own website to better serve the growing demand for toys online. Carson accepted the challenge from her son and thus began a new career in the toy industry. Since 2002, Fat Brain Toys has grown into one of the largest online toy stores in the country. Recognizing the importance of a true multi-channel experience, Fat Brain Toys has since expanded into brick & mortar retail, opening retail store experiences in Omaha, Nebraska and Overland Park, Kansas. In addition to the company’s direct-to-consumer efforts, the company also designs and wholesales it’s own line of products to over 2,000 retailers around the world. Fat Brain Toys is a frequent benefactor to a number of non-profit organizations that support the needs of children, including: Team Jack Foundation, Omaha Children’s Hospital Foundation, Royal Family Kids, The Toy Bank, and many others. Karen has been married to her husband and business partner, Mark, since 1992, and lives in Elkhorn, Nebraska. Karen and Mark have three children, Adam, Makenzie, and Jenna.

Passionate. Gregarious. Brave. Selfless. Spiritual. Unwavering. These are just a few of the words used to describe our Team Jack Foundation co-founder, Andy Hoffman. Tributes have poured in from around the country following Andy’s passing on Monday, March 1. Andy was shockingly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a rare and very aggressive cancer, after having a seizure while running on the Cowboy Trail, in his hometown of Atkinson, Nebraska, in July 2020. Even after getting this devastating news, Andy was more determined than ever to find ways to raise money for Team Jack. And fast, while he was still able. Following his diagnosis, the Team Jack Foundation launched the “Twice the Fight” campaign as a way to show support for both Jack and Andy Hoffman’s brain cancer battles. One of Andy’s first visions to raise money for Team Jack was to sell t-shirts, and this time selling “Twice the Fight” t-shirts saw nearly 3,000 sold for over $65,000 raised. Earlier in 2020, Andy worked hard to fulfill his New Year’s resolution and finished writing his first book, “Yards After Contact” which details the family’s experience during Jack’s fight. It was published in October 2020 and has been a huge success. From the beginning, Andy made one thing clear with his book: 100% of the proceeds for the book sales go to Team Jack and, Team Jack would own the copyright to the book. To date, over 2,500 books have been sold, raising nearly $80,000 for Team Jack. In the book, Andy writes: “This book is the mission statement for the Team Jack Foundation, a Nebraska business that tirelessly works daily to improve brain cancer treatment in its region and nationally fund child brain cancer research. I hope you can open this book and know Jack and what his foundation stands for.” In early December, both ESPN and BigTen Networks produced shows giving an update on the Hoffmans’ life with cancer. The ESPN E:60 story aired as part of programming highlighting the importance of cancer research during ESPN’s 14th consecutive V Week on Dec.1-12. Andy spoke with Chris Connelly about his fight and his hopes for the future of those fighting childhood brain cancer. “This is going to sound screwy, but it’s been a blessing,” he said. “We’re supposed to thank God for the challenges that he gives us, and I’ve prayed the thank-you prayer. Thank you, God, for giving me brain cancer. Because he knows what he’s doing. And you don’t.” Check off another chance for Andy to raise awareness of this disease. Andy always looked to seize every opportunity to raise awareness for childhood brain cancer and fund research from some of the brightest research minds in the country. Although the Hoffmans knew the research they were funding may not benefit their son Jack, he did it for all the families down the road that will receive the horrible diagnosis of pediatric brain cancer. Andy remained hopeful even when faced with the grim nature of his prognosis. Andy worked hard to squeeze more life into his 42 years than most get in a lifetime. He did a couple of bucket list items, including a New Mexico elk hunt with his kids, his wife, and brothers during the last months of his life. He kept his unwavering faith and spent every moment possible with his family.

From virtually every vantage point, sweeping views of Loch Raven Reservoir, towering trees and verdant golfing greens lend an air of majesty to the moment. And with each new experience, it becomes ever clearer that this is where you belong. Schedule A Tour Dawn Redwoods A Tale of Rare Beauty Our Club is home to about 75 dawn redwoods — one of the largest collections outside of China. Once prevalent throughout the Northern Hemisphere, these trees were thought to have become extinct until 1941, when a Chinese forester in the Sichuan province discovered more than 1,000 trees that had somehow survived. The trees at Eagle’s Nest are likely very close descendants of those discovered in China. How did so many of these magnificent trees find their way to Eagle’s Nest? According to Jimmy Watson, our first club president, his brother Bobby is to thank. “A nursery in York, PA, wanted to clear an area,” Jimmy explained. “So they said to Bobby, ‘Take ’em all … $1 apiece.’ They were the size of a broom handle. My brother and Roy Albin planted all the trees after work.” With that small investment roughly a half-century ago, another priceless attribute of Eagle’s Nest was born. \"Glad I chose the Club for this event...Management and Chef's execution exceeded my expectations. Bar service excellent and the wait and service staff were also wonderful.

      "text": "Swedish men buy Jensen Beach's Eagle Marsh Golf Club, plan renovations Charlie Kirk's 2017 Vero Beach visit offers lessons we should heed today | Opinion News Indian River Martin St. Lucie Sports Advertise Obits eNewspaper Legals NEWS Jensen Beach's Eagle Marsh Golf Club's new Swedish owners plan changes to Fazio course Catie Wegman Treasure Coast Newspapers Two Swedish golf entrepreneurs who bought Jensen Beach's Eagle Marsh Golf Club are making major changes they say will create jobs and increase tourism for Martin County. Johan Tumba and Joakim Sabel said they fell in love with Eagle Marsh's raw, natural beauty and believed it could be turned into a course that would attract thousands of golf fanatics from all over the world, Tumba told TCPalm Monday. “It’s an absolutely beautiful place that we think just needs some tender loving care,” he said. \"We heard so much about the history and loved everything about it, and we decided that we could make this golf course great again.\" The purchase agreement was private, and Tumba declined to disclose the purchase price. But the two are \"putting a lot of money\" into the renovations, he said. More: Craig Dolch's interview with Tommy Fazio Some of the projects include killing weeds, cleaning out lakes, re-coating the asphalt parking lot and updating the Eagle's Nest restaurant, Tumba said. They're also planning to work with the course's original designer, Tommy Fazio , to modernize it. More: Eagle's Nest restaurant inspections With close ties to Scandinavian players and the European Tour, the duo is confident the renovated golf course will attract at least 3,000 visitors each year, Tumba said. “The golfers in Sweden travel a lot during the wintertime, at least once or twice a year,\" he said. \"Nobody really offered great packages for Scandinavians to come to Florida, so when they come over here, they don’t really know where to play.\" Tumba and Sabel have been coordinating with local hotels and other courses to create a golf package for international players, Tumba said. \"We want to make it a total experience for people that come here from all over the world,\" Tumba said. As for new jobs, they plan to hire six new golf course employees, 10 restaurant employees and five unaffiliated professionals for independent golf lessons. Eagle Marsh is open to golfers during the renovations, and Tumba said he expects the course to be finished around Christmas. Catie Wegman is a TCPalm community reporter.
