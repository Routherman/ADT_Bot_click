Hardcover 9780300178692 Published: Tuesday, 26 Nov 2013 $30.00 Out of Stock Also Available At: Amazon Barnes & Noble Bookshop Indiebound Indigo Powell's Seminary Co-op Description Authors Praise A renowned biblical scholar contends that we have misconstrued the meaning and lessons of the Garden of Eden story for more than two millennia The Garden of Eden story, one of the most famous narratives in Western history, is typically read as an ancient account of original sin and humanity’s fall from divine grace. In this highly innovative study, Ziony Zevit argues that this is not how ancient Israelites understood the early biblical text. Drawing on such diverse disciplines as biblical studies, geography, archaeology, mythology, anthropology, biology, poetics, law, linguistics, and literary theory, he clarifies the worldview of the ancient Israelite readers during the First Temple period and elucidates what the story likely meant in its original context. Most provocatively, he contends that our ideas about original sin are based upon misconceptions originating in the Second Temple period under the influence of Hellenism. He shows how, for Ancient Israelites, the story was really about how humans achieved ethical discernment. He argues further that Adam was not made from dust and that Eve was not made from Adam’s rib.  His study unsettles much of what has been taken for granted about the story for more than two millennia and has far-reaching implications for both literary and theological interpreters. Ziony Zevit is Distinguished Professor of Biblical Literature and Northwest Semitic Languages and Literatures at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles. He is widely recognized for his publications in Hebrew epigraphy, biblical studies, and ancient Israelite religion. \"Classical Hebrew in the hands of Ziony Zevit is like a cello in the hands of a master cellist. He knows all the hidden subtleties of the instrument, and he makes you hear them in this rendition of the profoundly simple story of Adam, Eve, the Serpent, and their Creator in the Garden of Eden. Zevit brings a greal deal of other biblical learning to bear in a surprisingly light-hearted book. He is playing in that sense, too. But for me it is the touch of the master in his handling of Hebrew syntax that stands out most. Others can equal him in those other regards. In this one he is without peer.\"—Jack Miles, author of God: A Biography ~Jack Miles \"Ziony Zevit’s new book is far more than an exploration of the Garden of Eden narrative alone. Along the way, he leads his readers into a host of related topics: ancient biblical interpretation, Jewish and Christian; the Documentary Hypothesis and modern scholars; feminist readings of the Bible; ancient Near Eastern geography; the development of the Hebrew alphabet; Egyptian garden landscaping; Israelite curse formulae; blood avengers in the biblical world—and, believe it or not, a good deal more. Without ever leaving Eden behind, his book is thus an enticing vade mecum into the various fields that make up modern biblical scholarship.\"—James Kugel, author of How to Read the BIble ~James Kugel “Zevit provides a clearly written, learned, and imaginative reinterpretation of the Garden of Eden story. Drawing on his broad knowledge of the Bible, other ancient sources, as well as from modern and medieval biblical scholarship, he tests traditional views while suggesting new ways of understanding this biblical classic.”—Mark Smith, New York University ~Mark Smith \"Zevit’s careful analysis of the Garden Story significantly challenges the traditional interpretation and theological understanding of this pivotal text. All who read this book will deepen their understanding of the biblical text and future studies will have to take Zevit's conclusions into account.\"—Tremper Longman III, Westmont College ~Tremper Longman III “A model of biblical scholarship that is also wholly accessible to the general reader . . . enlivened by Zevit’s wit and good humor . . .  Artful, charming, and informative.”—Jonathan Kirsch, Jewish Journal ~Jonathan Kirsch, Jewish Journal “Consistently engaging”—Mary Joan Winn Leith, Biblical Archaeology Review ~Mary Joan Winn Leith, Biblical Archaeology Review \"Zevit's captivating style makes this material not only accessible but also fascinating.\"—A.J.

Table of Contents Toggle About Bull & Whistle Bar What Makes Garden of Eden Special? Drinks and Services Available at Garden of Eden Things to Keep in Mind Before Going to Garden of Eden Garden of Eden Key West Photos Garden of Eden Key West Reviews Wrapping Up About Bull & Whistle Bar As we mentioned, Garden of Eden is nothing but a part of the Bull & Whistle Bar. This place consists of three floors that offer a different experience to all customers. The Bull is on the first floor. We recommend it if you want to go to a pub with a chill atmosphere to hang out with your friends while you listen to good music. Up next is The Whistle. This one is on the second floor, and it’s for people looking for an upbeat experience. The bar is filled with pool tables and all kinds of drinking games. At last, we have Garden of Eden . The clothing-optional bar we will review on this page offers an open-minded way to have fun in Key West. What Makes Garden of Eden Special? Needless to say, what makes Garden of Eden stand out from other options is that you can be naked there. However, the bar is much more than just that. Garden of Eden promotes being yourself. Customers don’t have to hide who they are to have fun. Therefore, the atmosphere is mostly friendly among other clients and staff alike. If it’s your first time going, everyone will try to make your experience as comfortable as possible. We loved that the bar has strict security measures to make sure customers can have fun in a safe and respectful environment. You won’t be able to take any kind of photos or videos. Also, the staff acts quickly if they notice someone bothering the other clients in any way. Once you are in the bar, you will see that the dance floor takes up most of the room. However, you still have some space to speak to your friends if you want to rest up a bit. Drinks and Services Available at Garden of Eden You can drink as much as you want here.

While clothing is optional, being naked is not mandatory. You can wear whatever you want in this bar. There is usually a balanced mix of people wearing and not wearing clothes. For hygiene purposes, the bar asks guests to use towels when they sit. Garden of Eden Key West Photos I wish I could provide photos of Garden of Eden, but they are strictly prohibited.  Anyone taking photos will be apprehended by the bouncers and thrown out. They don’t mess around with this, so I’m sorry to report, I don’t have any Garden of Eden pics to show! Garden of Eden Key West Reviews You’ll find reviews of the nude bar all over the place.  The people not wanting go pay for over-priced drinks and dance nude usually say bad things, like some of these on TripAdvisor . Then, you have this guy, who clearly was excited about his wife showing off her “fabulous melons” on the dance floor. And of course, a pic of his wifey for sport. A customers wife walks into the bar before she goes topless dancing. Wrapping Up We 100% recommend Garden of Eden in Key West. You will have a night you will never forget. Regardless of the clothing-optional thing, the bar has a great atmosphere, excellent drinks, and approachable staff. Most guests are friendly, and you will surely meet new friends there.

I’m shy, quiet, and self-conscious by nature, but I wanted to see if I could get out of my comfort zone. Fast forward, I’ve been there many times since then. I usually avoid evenings and head up there to hang out naked early afternoons. Over the years I’ve had some conversations with others that I never would have had if we were all clothed. I’m older and even more self-conscious about my body these days, but I don’t want to lose the chance to let go and try to feel more free. Love the place and am looking forward to returning soon. With Atlantic Shores resort long gone this might be the only place you can still get naked in Key West anytime outside of Fantasy Fest. Reply Peter C.

The Bull & Whistle is really like three bars – each with their own unique personality. On the first floor is The Bull – a large space with a long stretch of bar, table seating and a small stage where local musicians perform nightly. The Bull is one of the few remaining open-air bars of Key West, stepping in is like stepping back into the Old Town heritage of the island. It has a genuine carousing feel making it is easy to pop in, grab a drink and watch the crowds go by. On the second floor is The Whistle , which features a large squared bar, pool tables, games and (most importantly) a balcony overlooking Duval Street.  The balcony offers some of the best people watching and is a popular place to get some fresh air and warm breeze, day or night. The wrap around porch gives you some distance from the crowds of Duval and Caroline St. with the same entertainment. On the roof is another bar that has made more than a few people blush.  Known as the Garden of Eden , this rooftop bar is “clothing optional” – and they mean it. The Garden of Eden gives you a bird's eye view of the island among other things... If these walls could talk. more Art from the bull & whistle 224 Duval Street, Key West, FL 33040 Featured Gallery Hero Banner Dashboard Secondary Banner Location + Social Bull & Whistle Bar 224 Duval Street, Key West, FL, 33040, United States 3052964545 info@bullkeywest.com Hours Mon 10am - 4am Tue 10am - 4am Wed 10am - 4am Thu 10am - 4am Fri 10am - 4am Sat 10am - 4am Sun 10am - 4am Bull & Whistle Bar 224 Duval Street  Key West, FL 33040 info@bullkeywest.com | 305-296-4545 Home The Bull Whistle Bar Garden of Eden Entertainment Contact Us"

Great place to meet and talk with new friends. It is amazing how removing clothes also removes many other inhibitions. Nothing lewd goes on and is frankly, not allowed. But is a great place to have fun. I go there often every time I'm in Key West, which is several times per year. Jeannie is the best bartender around! — Randy J ★ ★ ★ ★ This bar definitely offered a very “unique” vibe, but overall was an enjoyable experience. Clothing is optional, but there is no pressure for anyone to remove their clothes if not comfortable. Love that it’s on a rooftop patio, and it’s also neat that they offer body painting to those who are interested!
