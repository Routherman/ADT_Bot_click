If interested in either option, contact the management office in advance of your arrival to inquire about availability. After Hours Arrival If your plans change and you need to arrive outside of normal business hours, please refer to your confirmed reservation information. Or, contact or message our call center at (650) 206-7323 prior to arrival to make late arrival arrangements. Reservations & Payments Your credit card will be charged Itinerary Total prior to arrival, up to a maximum deposit of one night rack rate. Any remaining balance is due prior to arrival. Prices and site type are subject to availability. The rates displayed do not include any applicable service fees or charges for optional incidentals. RV sites and lodging typically accommodate four guests.  A guest fee is added per day to the reservation rate for each additional guest over four. To make changes to your reservation, please call our Reservation Department at (877) 864-2728 and specify that you booked your reservation online. If I used a credit card for a deposit, guarantee or payment, I authorize MHC Property Management L.P. to charge any expenses incurred during my stay to that credit card or apply funds you have on deposit with us against what I owe. Cancellations & Refunds In the case of multiple sites booked, cancellation penalties apply to each site that is cancelled or changed. No refunds will be issued for early check-out. If the cancellation fee is greater than the deposit received, the guest is required to pay the difference. RV campsites: For stays 1 to 27 days, we allow full refunds for cancellations up to 2 days prior to your arrival date. Rental accommodations: For stays 1 to 27 days, we allow full refunds for cancellations 7 days prior to your arrival date. For guests booking a stay in a rental accommodation located in California of 30 or fewer consecutive days, a full refund will be given for reservations cancelled within 24 hours of booking provided the reservation’s arrival date is at least 72 hours after the time of booking. Long-term or seasonal stays: For stays 28 days to 184 days at an RV campsite or in a rental accommodation, if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you. If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required 45 days’ notice, you will forfeit your deposit amount. For guests booking a long-term or seasonal reservation in a rental accommodation in California (31 days to 184 days), if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you. If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required notice, you forfeit your deposit amount. Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy Pets are allowed. Campground Services & Information Please be advised: while our beach access trail is not available for use due to cliff erosion, there is a nearby City of Pacifica public walking trail that guests can use to access the beach. Free WiFi hotspot located in the office. Additional WiFi available at the site for a fee. We do not allow tent camping. Please do not bring tents or truck camper shells to the resort when you camp. Due to size restrictions only motorhomes are permitted on Premium Inland sites. Our sites accommodate smaller rigs up to 45' motorhomes. The main office does not accept guests' packages and mail; packages will be returned to the sender. If a package is received and accepted, a $10.00 Mailbox Fee per package will be applied to your reservation . We encourage you to use an Amazon Locker or contact our local Post Office.

To make changes to your reservation please call our Reservation Department at (877) 864-2728 and specify that you booked your reservation online. Deposit and Payment Schedule By using a credit card for a deposit, guarantee or payment, you agree to the following: if I used a credit card for a deposit, guarantee or payment, I authorize MHC Property Management L.P. to charge any expenses incurred during my stay to that credit card or apply funds you have on deposit with MHC Property Management L.P. against what I owe. Daily/Weekly Stays Your credit card will be charged a deposit of one night rack rate. Any remaining balance is due prior to arrival. Extended Stays For all stays of one month or longer, a one month deposit up to a maximum deposit of $750 is required at the time of reservation. See below for information about remaining balances. 1 to 3 Months Balance due on reservation start date. 4 to 5 Months 50% of balance is due on reservation start date. Final balance due on 1st day of 2nd month of reservation. 6 months or longer 50% of balance due on reservation start date. 25% of balance due on 1st day of 2nd month of reservation. Final balance is due on 1st day of 3rd month of reservation. Annual Park Model/Tied Down camper: one month deposit is required for new guests. RV annuals: one month deposit is required. Monthly payment schedule for annual reservations is subject to good credit history and credit card agreement on file. The method of payment for deposits is credit or debit card. If a deposit is made in person, cash and/or check are acceptable. Cancellation and Refund Policy In the case of multiple sites booked, cancellation penalties apply to each site that is cancelled or changed. No refunds will be issued for early check-out. RV campsites: For stays 1 to 27 days, we allow full refunds for cancellations up to 2 days prior to your arrival date. Rental accommodations: For stays 1 to 27 days, we allow full refunds for cancellations 7 days prior to your arrival date. For guests booking a stay in a rental accommodation located in California of 30 or fewer consecutive days, a full refund will be given for reservations cancelled within 24 hours of booking provided the reservation’s arrival date is at least 72 hours after the time of booking. Long-term or seasonal stays: For stays 28 days to 184 days at an RV campsite or in a rental accommodation, if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you. If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required 45 days’ notice, you will forfeit your deposit amount. For guests booking a long-term or seasonal reservation in a rental accommodation in California (31 days to 184 days), if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you. If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required notice, you forfeit your deposit amount. Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy A maximum of two pets, per site. Pet policy for rental accommodations: Pets are welcome. For those who camp with pets, there is a pet fee of $10 per pet per night for our pet-friendly rental units. The fee may vary at select properties. Service animals are not pets. The Company complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state/local laws regarding service animals. Service animals may accompany a disabled person without any proof of disability or certification for the service animal. Guests traveling with a service animal will not be charged a pet fee. Charges may be incurred, however, should a service animal damage the rental unit. Campground Services & Information All cabin rentals require a minimum stay of two nights. A $150 security will apply at time of check-in, and will be refunded at time of check-out if there is no damage. We have two pet-friendly cabins two pets maximum per cabin.

Our site was full hookup and included cable TV.  Reception was a bit fuzzy on all channels, but we didn’t come for the cable TV.  The No-See-Ums were more than a nuisance at the campground.  I backpack and came armed with several great bug repellents, Deep Woods Off included. Nothing worked to ward off the No-See-Ums.  The bites continue to itch even with topical treatments.  There was only one flush toilet and one shower available for men during our visit.  If my stay was any longer than 6 days, I would have shortened the visit due to the ruthless No-See-Ums.  AT&T cellular service clocked in at 63.5 Mbps download speed and 4.05 upload speed.  Verizon clocked in at 2.90 Mbps download speed and 0.70 upload speed.  Some destinations may warrant braving insect problems, like Assateague Island National Seashore and the biting flies.  A stay at Crystal Isles RV Resort doesn’t warrant putting up with the No-See-Ums in my opinion.  Know before you go.

For guests booking a long-term or seasonal reservation in a rental accommodation in California (31 days to 184 days), if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you. If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required notice, you forfeit your deposit amount. Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy A maximum of two pets, per site. Pet policy for rental accommodations: Pets are welcome. For those who camp with pets, there is a pet fee of $10 per pet per night for our pet-friendly rental units. The fee may vary at select properties. Service animals are not pets. The Company complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state/local laws regarding service animals. Service animals may accompany a disabled person without any proof of disability or certification for the service animal. Guests traveling with a service animal will not be charged a pet fee. Charges may be incurred, however, should a service animal damage the rental unit. Campground Services & Information All cabin rentals require a minimum stay of two nights. A $150 security will apply at time of check-in, and will be refunded at time of check-out if there is no damage. We have two pet-friendly cabins two pets maximum per cabin.

If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required notice, you forfeit your deposit amount. Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy A maximum of two pets, per site. Pet policy for rental accommodations: Pets are welcome. For those who camp with pets, there is a pet fee of $10 per pet per night for our pet-friendly rental units. The fee may vary at select properties. Service animals are not pets. The Company complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state/local laws regarding service animals. Service animals may accompany a disabled person without any proof of disability or certification for the service animal. Guests traveling with a service animal will not be charged a pet fee. Charges may be incurred, however, should a service animal damage the rental unit. Campground Services & Information All cabin rentals require a minimum stay of two nights. A $150 security will apply at time of check-in, and will be refunded at time of check-out if there is no damage. We have two pet-friendly cabins two pets maximum per cabin.

If you have a boat and want a place with extended stay and have water access nearby, this is the place for you. If you want a place to stay just for a few days in a large, dry site with a large intact concrete slab, this is not the place to stay. During Florida summers, rain is a constant but in this RV park that means mud and sites with standing water. Many of the concrete slabs are either very small or cracked. Many of the sites are very small and uneven. This RV park is more of a trailer park with many or most sites long-term residents with permanent sheds and buildings built on the sites housing their RV or boat. The dumpsters are in one location at the front of the park so most residents have to drive their trash to the dumpster. The WiFi is very slow when you can log in. We were unable to get the cable to work. We rented a boat so having water access with the dock was very convenient. The staff is very friendly and helpful with easy check in.

The pictures on the internet are of nice level spots with plenty of room, well kept and maintained.  The first spot we were assigned was impossible for us to get into, and it was so rocky it would have been close to impossible to level.

If you have a boat and want a place with extended stay and have water access nearby, this is the place for you. If you want a place to stay just for a few days in a large, dry site with a large intact concrete slab, this is not the place to stay. During Florida summers, rain is a constant but in this RV park that means mud and sites with standing water. Many of the concrete slabs are either very small or cracked. Many of the sites are very small and uneven. This RV park is more of a trailer park with many or most sites long-term residents with permanent sheds and buildings built on the sites housing their RV or boat. The dumpsters are in one location at the front of the park so most residents have to drive their trash to the dumpster. The WiFi is very slow when you can log in. We were unable to get the cable to work. We rented a boat so having water access with the dock was very convenient. The staff is very friendly and helpful with easy check in.

Long-term or seasonal stays: For stays 28 days to 184 days at an RV campsite or in a rental accommodation, if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you.

For guests booking a long-term or seasonal reservation in a rental accommodation in California (31 days to 184 days), if you cancel or change your reservation up to and including 45 days prior to your scheduled arrival date, we will issue a refund for the amounts paid by you. If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required notice, you forfeit your deposit amount. Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy A maximum of two pets, per site. Pet policy for rental accommodations: Pets are welcome. For those who camp with pets, there is a pet fee of $10 per pet per night for our pet-friendly rental units. The fee may vary at select properties. Service animals are not pets. The Company complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state/local laws regarding service animals. Service animals may accompany a disabled person without any proof of disability or certification for the service animal. Guests traveling with a service animal will not be charged a pet fee. Charges may be incurred, however, should a service animal damage the rental unit. Campground Services & Information All cabin rentals require a minimum stay of two nights.

Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy A maximum of two pets, per site.

If you cancel your reservation and provide less than the required notice, you forfeit your deposit amount. Annual stays: Due to the strong demand for our extended-stay reservations (lasting 185 days or more) and the limited site availability at many of our campgrounds and resorts, we recommend securing an extended-stay site by placing a site holding deposit. This deposit can be made at your convenience and consists of a $150 site holding fee, which is fully refundable under the following terms and conditions. Should an Agreement for Use of RV Site for your extended stay not be fully executed within seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) following our receipt of your $150 site holding deposit, or within any additional time needed between the parties to finalize the Agreement, then the site holding deposit ($150) is fully refundable to your original form of payment. Once we issue your refund, it may take an additional 7-10 days for your financial institution to make funds available in your account. Please contact us at (855) 336-8892 if you have not signed an Agreement for Use of RV Site or received a refund within that time frame. Please note that the $150 site holding deposit secures a site at your selected campground or resort, but does not secure a specific site. A manager or other employee working at that campground or resort should reach out to you after you make the $150 site holding deposit to discuss site location and the execution of an Agreement for Use of RV Site. In order to sign an Agreement for Use of RV Site allowing an extended stay at a campground or resort, you must meet residency requirements for seasonal or annual stays. If you become an annual guest pursuant to an executed Agreement for Use of RV Site, the $150 site holding deposit will then be applied to either the administrative fee (if applicable), or will be credited towards the annual site payment. Advertised rates do not include taxes and fees. Electricity is not included for stays of 30 days or longer. Usage of any seasonal or annual site may be limited to dates that the campground or resort is open. While, if you become a seasonal or annual guest pursuant to an Agreement for Use of RV Site, you may leave your RV on the site year-round, there are restrictions that limit the amount of time you may occupy your RV on the site that vary by campground and resort. Open dates and length of stay vary by campground and resort. Must be a current Thousand Trails member or purchase a Camping Pass membership in connection with seasonal or annual stays at Thousand Trails campground. Amenities vary by campground and resort. Please discuss details with the manager of the campground or resort that you select. Start the process for your longer stay by following this link. Pet Policy Pets are allowed. Rental Pet Policy: Pets are welcome. For those who camp with pets, there is a pet fee of $10 per pet per night for our pet-friendly rental lodging. The fee may vary at select properties.
