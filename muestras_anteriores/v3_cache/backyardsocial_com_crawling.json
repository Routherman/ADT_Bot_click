FORT MYERS, Fla. — A 3-year-old plan for Fort Myers' newest social spot opens its doors Thursday, but Fox 4 got a sneak peek of the hangout on Wednesday. Backyard Social located off of I-75 and Alico Road in Fort Myers has food and entertainment options for all. \"I've been here for about 15 years, Mat's been here his whole life, and there's never really been a lot to do,\" said John Mann, Co-owner of Backyard Social. \"We wanted to bring this to town so that we could have something to do as well for all of our friends and family.” However, Mann along with his partner Mat Baum said the development process was a learning curve for them. “Two years ago today, we were ready with an engineering firm, with everything to go straight into doing everything we needed for zoning,\" said Baum. \"It took about 14 months before we could put a shovel in the ground, so the actual building and all the infrastructure only took about nine or 10 months to complete.” The Backyard Social is now opening just in time for the Southwest Florida tourist season and one year out from the rebuilding efforts of Hurricane Ian. \"Fort Myers is growing,\" said Baum. \"There's a great demographic here. It's not Fort Myers 40 years ago or 30 years ago when I was growing up, it's different.\" However, with opening a business in the midst of a nationwide labor shortage, there is some concern. According to the US Chamber of Commerce , the food service industry is struggling the most and currently has the highest \"quit rate\" being consistently over 4.9 percent since July 2021. \"You see people quitting their jobs, like never before, to find someplace that fits that for them,\" said Baum. \"I'm hopeful that, you know, in the food and beverage space that's kind of what we're fulfilling for them.\" Both Mann and Baum noted with the location being centralized to new housing developments, golf courses, and Florida Gulf Coast University, they expect crowds of all types. \"It's going to bring up the economy way above what we expect, just in this area, because this area is really growing,\" said Mark Miloff, Membership Director for the Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce. The Southwest Florida locals say they are excited to see their three years of work come to life. Backyard Social opens to the public on Thursday. Copyright 2023 Scripps Media, Inc.

Latest Places New Real Estate Favorite Royal Palm Coast Realtors Association New Shopping Favorite Caloosahatchee Cannabis Company New Professional Directory Favorite Stilwell Enterprises & Restaurant Group New Professional Directory Favorite Florida Trust Wealth Management New Professional Directory Favorite Collaboratory View all HOT NEW Hangout Backyard Social delivers a new concept to Southwest Florida By Staff on December 07, 2023 BY CARLIE ADMIRE carlie.admire@floridaweekly.com Customers try out the bar’s bowling lanes. The owners want guests to find new ways to interact with each other. Step on the AstroTurf of Backyard Social and see what all the hype is all about. Backyard Social, located near Gulf Coast Town Center, launched a new bar, food and entertainment concept more than a month ago and the place hasn’t slowed down. So, what’s the buzz? “Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere,” began local Jeff Martin. “It is the new era of the food court,” laughed Mat Baum, part owner of Backyard Social. “We wanted to bring a big-city setting to here, from our layout and mural on the walls to the food options, games and more,” said Baum. “We picked this location because of the growing community. We are right by some big neighborhoods and near the airport and university. We thought this area needed something new and fresh.” The locals agree. “It is different than any other place here in Fort Myers. It is such a great and central location to meet up with your friends,” said Kailey Grigsby. She was so impressed she visited multiple times. “Plus, it is such a good mix of people. It is already my third time being here since it open and easily the new place to meet up for lunch, happy hour and spend my weekends.” Backyard Social hit its 300-person capacity the first week it was open. “It is such a vibe; it’s a big place and I love the openness of the bar area and the outside seating with the firepits and live music. They opened this at the perfect time, the weather for this is great. You just want to sit outside and enjoy yourself,” said Vanessa Falcon of Bonita Springs. Backyard Social has a 300-person capacity. It hit that limit the first weekend. Support continues to grow. “We had to double our projections and supplies after opening.” With more than 200 parking spots, owners are looking to expand to accommodate the rush. “We thought about adding in valet parking and giving some perks to it, such as free to groups of four or more in encourage carpooling or using Uber,” said Baum. Backyard Social is a 9,000-square-foot barn-style structure. It has an immense center bar, an entertainment stage, and games like cornhole, shuffleboard, bowling and darts. Eight food trucks line the perimeter. Each serves a different type of fare. COURTESY PHOTOS “We are one in five in the U.S. to have this dartboard, called Dartsee. Justin Timberlake and Tiger Woods also have it in a bar opening in New York. We added the games to help people socialize, rather than just talking to the people sitting next to you. It just adds to our social theme and lets people get to know each other easier,” added Baum. Backyard Social has eight food trucks circling the inside perimeter. Dining options range from Venezuelan, BBQ classics and a mac and cheese station. “I wanted to make sure I had a variety of food options and none of them overlapped each other. I have known the Great Foodini Seafood for about two and half years, and they were first on my list. We have Addison’s Chicken that won Best of Collier County. Tyler from Beau’s BBQ is a local here and attended Bishop Verot,” said Baum. “We added in our Love Boat ice cream bar to satisfy everyone’s sweet tooth. We pick up our ice cream weekly from their main store and offer two sizes and few favorite toppings.” Backyard Social brings a new entertainment concept to Southwest Florida. Food trucks, drinks and games give customers a new way to have fun. Baum plans on keeping his current truck vendors saying, “as long as they are happy and we are happy, they are here to stay and serve.” Oran Townsen from The Great Foodini’s Mobile Bistro has had his truck for four years, dishing up gourmet seafood. “It has been a great turnout. I love when people come up to my truck and I can talk to them about our food and what we got going on. My favorites are the Lobster Roll and Chef ’s Plate, which has Jamaican jerk snapper over shrimp fried rice with a sweet Thai chili glaze,” said Townsen. “I am here for the food and the scenery. One of the coolest parts, is that you can order from the food trucks off your phone or with the QR code on your table and they text you when it is ready. If you are sitting, they bring it to you, which helps with lines and you are not standing around waiting,” said Falcon. The dart game inside Backyard Social is the same system going into a New York bar owned by Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake. Backyard Social also has a fully stocked bar with signature cocktails, including The Lily Pad. It’s served in a bucket and topped with blood orange slices and a rubber frog. Purchase a Backyard Social silicone cup for $15 and receive a dollar off signature drinks when you return and reuse it. Proceeds support Captions for Clean Water, a group dedicated to protecting Southwest Florida’s environment. “I love making ‘Live Laugh Lychee.’ It is a very crushable drink. It is fruity and refreshing. No matter how busy we are, I always make sure to give the customer the experience of watching me craft their drink. With this one, we slap the drink with mint at the end,” said Robby Podgorski, bartender at Backyard Social. “You always have to do it right!” Bar-goers approved. “It is my second time being here. I was here last night with some ladies as a girl’s night and my husband was so upset I went out without him, so now I am back,” said Jeanne Martin. “I wanted to check it out. It is amazing, and the bartenders and service is great especially considering how busy it is. We will definitely be back, often,” said Jeff Martin. “It is just the entire experience, being outside with the band playing. I read about it in a local paper, and we love Celebration Park in Naples, so we knew we had to stop by and try this place out,” said Karen Collier. Not a night owl? Pop in for lunch. “I love supporting local businesses and had to swing in for lunch with some of my work buddies. I got the BBQ, and it was fantastic,” said Craig Weinbaum. “I have been a bartender for about a decade, and I love working here,” said Podgorski. “The atmosphere is so fun and the way it is layout it so psychedelic. They really nailed it. If you can dream it, you can create it. It is exactly what they did here.” Holiday Drive Backyard Social is also giving back to the community. The business is hosting a sports ball and pajama drive. It’s partnering with the Gladiolus Food Pantry to collect donations this Christmas. Bring new, unwrapped pajamas sizes newborn to 2x. Backyard Social is also collecting any type of new sports balls. The donations can be dropped off through Thursday, Dec. 14. Backyard Social employees will deliver the items to the food pantry on Dec. 16. Anyone who donates will get a free drink up to $9 in value. ¦ In the KNOW Food truck park, bar, games and live entertainment · Where: 16371 Corporate Commerce Way, Fort Myers · Contact: 239-703-7077 or info@backyardsocial.com · Hours: Monday-Wednesday, 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Thursday, 11:30 a.m.-midnight; Friday, 11:30 to 2 a.m.; Saturday, 11 p.m.-2 a.m.; and Sunday, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. · Website: backyardsocial.com/contact-2/ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

(WWSB) - A new eatery and entertainment spot is being planned for Lakewood Ranch. It’s called Backyard Social and the owner, Mathew Baum, said they’re excited. “We hope to start building in the next four months or so, but you know, we’re super excited about it,” said Baum. It would be built on Professional Parkway in Lakewood Ranch Corporate Park. Stanley Morrow, a concerned resident, is afraid it doesn’t fit with the feel of the area. “Our prior county commissioners, they had a vision for this area. Its working nicely. Waterside Place is a nice neighbor, they have music, they have entertainment. They are in harmony with us, don’t blow it,” said Morrow. Morrow said he lives about a mile down the street from where Backyard Social would be built. He explained another major concern is the noise, especially if they can have live music and DJ’s later into the night. “Sound travels. We can hear 75, we can even hear the jets taking off in the airport which is 15 miles away sometimes. Its not just that, its also other businesses in the area. Once one gets it, the other businesses in the area are going to want it,” said Morrow. Baum said he understands residents’ frustrations and explained once its open, they will see it fits in with the feel of Lakewood Ranch. He referenced their other location in Fort Myers as an example which just held their monthly Sunday Fun Day event. “We have a bounce house out there, cotton candy, we do arts and crafts for kids. So, I think, you know, the picture that has been painted by a few people of a dance club or something that’s just geared towards a late-night crowd or something like that, is not accurate,” said Baum. Baum added that they have been following all the rules when it comes to applications and the building process. He also stated that once they open, they will continue following the rules which include the noise ordinance in Sarasota County. Morrow is a part of a group of concerned residents that call themselves The Waterside Neighborhood Alliance. They made a press release prior to an upcoming public hearing scheduled for Jan. 15, at 9 a.m. That will be taking place at the Robert L. Anderson Administration Center Chambers.

Our Mission To provide a place where kids and youth of The River Valley can come and make lifelong friends, create lifelong memories, and experience a life-changing God right in their own backyard. Our Vision To build a gospel-centered community through the kids and youth. Core Values Evangelize - Our heart is to reach our community. Excellence - Our goal is to never be satisfied with where we are, but to push the creative boundaries to always provide our community with a quality service. Enduring - It's our hope and prayer that what takes place on our campgrounds will last a lifetime. Everyone - Regardless of race, beliefs, social status, or background, all are welcome and will be cared for equally. Our History In spring of 2019, Van Buren First Assembly of God purchased about 13 acres right across the street from their main campus on Fayetteville Rd. It's a piece of land in the middle of town, but ironically sometimes it feels like you're in the middle of nowhere. Immediately, the church began clearing the land, trees, and old buildings in preparation for the future, whatever it might hold. After much thought and prayer, it was decided that this piece of land would be the perfect place for a summer camp that would be open to the community. That's where the idea of The Backyard was born. Our community is in desperate need of fun activities for kids and youth to be a part of and participate in throughout the summer. And we believe that here at The Backyard we can help meet that need while also providing an avenue to the cross. Our Partners Here at The Backyard, we are very thankful that we have had incredible partners to work with. And since our partners have helped us out, we'd like to give them a shoutout as well!
