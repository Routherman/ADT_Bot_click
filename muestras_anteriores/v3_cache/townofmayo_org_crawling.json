Lafayette Blue Springs State Park 799 NW Blue Spring Rd Mayo, Florida 32066 (386) 294-3667 https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Lafayette-Blue-Springs Lafayette Blue Springs State Park is a great place to cool off this summer. There is fishing, swimming, diving, and picnicking in the park. The swimming and diving areas have been closed for much of the spring season due to earlier flooding and brown-out conditions. Please check the park’s website before heading out to make sure that it is open for swimming. Of course, the other non-water activities are usually always available. Ruth Springs Park is part of the Suwannee River Water Management District Recreational Areas and is in the Ruth Walker Springs Tract just before Troy Springs State Park. To get a map of the area please visit their website: Ruth Springs and Branford Bend Recreational Areas There are lots of dirt roads, access to the Suwannee River, and places to enjoy nature but the main attraction is the small spring swimming area. It is located off of NE Ruth Springs Road just past the “Son-Rise” sign on the right and you will see a small dirt road on your left, when you turn down it there will be a fork in the road just a little way up bear left and the springs swimming area is located at the bottom of the hill. It gets crowded on the weekends so either come early in the morning, later in the afternoon or during the week when everyone is working! Owens Spring Tract is located at the corner of County Road 410 and County Road 411 in Mayo, Florida. The spring swimming area is located about a mile down from the dirt road entrance with a parking area and you walk down the trail about 300 feet to the spring itself. Yes, it is a cold spring. There is a rope swing for those who want to just jump in and get wet. Be careful the rocks are slippery and you have to climb over and around them to get in and out of the water. Not a real good area for little swimmers though. There is a cave under the water that we saw a couple of scuba divers exploring. You can hike, fish, ride horses and do some hunting in the area but not around the Springs, please. This is also part of the Suwannee River Water Management District’s Recreational Lands area. You can find out more from their website: Owens Spring Tract .

We have obtained a copy of her brochure for the Resort: DOWNLOAD BROCHURE Cindy’s Motel and RV Park 487 West Main Street Mayo, Florida 32066 (386) 294-1242 http://www.cindysmotel.com/rvpark.html RV Camping and Motel Rooms. The site manager was very nice when we came by for a visit. There are actually 14 RV Camping Sites on the grounds as well as the motel. Everything looks clean and tidy. They really need their website updated though and they are not on Facebook. River Run Campground 2739 U.S. 27 Branford, Fl 32008 (386) 935-6553 www.riverruncampgroundflorida.com Yes, they are listed in Branford, Florida but like Troy Springs they are physically located in Lafayette County Florida. They have some great reviews on Google. Pictures and more information to come. They do have a pretty good website but no Facebook Page. Lafayette Blue Springs State Park 799 NW Blue Spring Rd Mayo, Florida 32066 (386) 294-3667 https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Lafayette-Blue-Springs They have Primitive Camping and the Cabin Camping you can reserve through Reserve America The Tent camping area is walk-up only and charges $10 a night. We visited there in the early part of June and there was no campground host, one port-a-potty, no showers that we could find out all the campsites looked in decent repair with electricity, water, fire ring, clothesline and picnic table at each of them. They are fairly close to each other and only about 10×10 spaces. The group camping area is a large grass field up next to private property. That campsite is up on the hill right along the Suwannee River. The cabins are huge and way up off the ground.

This high bluff that overlooks Buffalo Lake first served our community as Taylor’s Union Cemetery, donated for public use by town founder Jackson Taylor.  The cemetery was moved to the present Lakeview Cemetery location in 1895, and this block became a city park.  Being the highest point in the village, the first water tower was built here in 1919.  Much of the block in 1950 was then used for the new city hospital.  In 2004, it now returns to its use as a city park – a memorial to our founders, and to those who have served our city, state, and country.

In addition, every national park is part of our collective identity that defines who we are and where we came from as a nation. They are tactile reminders of the values, the ideals, and the freedoms that our veterans protect. The majestic landscapes, natural wonders, and patriotic icons that we cherish as a society have also inspired military members through the years. The Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, the USS Arizona Memorial, and the Statue of Liberty are just a few of the national parks that have served as reminders of home to those stationed abroad. On Veterans Day, or any day, honor those who have served and sacrificed for our country with a visit to a national park. The National Park Service invites all visitors to remember our veterans by visiting any National Park Service site for free on Veterans Day (November 11).
