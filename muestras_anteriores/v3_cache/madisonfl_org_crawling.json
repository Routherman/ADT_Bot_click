Citizens' Ad Hoc Naming Committee - New southside elementary school Citizens' Ad Hoc Naming Committee - New southside elementary school Thanks to the community’s investment in our public schools during the 2020 referendum, the district constructed a new elementary school connected to Badger Rock Middle School. The new school, which opened fall 2023, has temporarily been called Southside Elementary until a permanent name is chosen. On Monday, May 6, the MMSD Board of Education voted to establish a 12-person committee for the purpose of naming the district's newest elementary school located at 501 E. Badger Road (currently referred to as Southside Elementary). The Ad Hoc Citizens’ Naming Committee is given the charge to follow Board Policy 6700 and move through the school naming process. This committee will follow the policy and make final recommendations to a Board of Education Work Group on the soonest date possible after the final meeting of this ad hoc committee.
