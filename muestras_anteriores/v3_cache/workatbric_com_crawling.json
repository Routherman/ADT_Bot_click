To advance this vision, the current, limited land-use laws (not revised since the 1960s) need to change to reflect the desires of a talented workforce and benefit the greater community at large. Currently, BRiC is restricted to solely commercial office park operations which offer services exclusively to its office tenants, nothing else … and thus, no benefit at all to the greater community-at-large . Without rezoning, their plans for Boca Raton’s first food hall, presentation space that seats up to 1,000, coffee shops, and events can only be exclusively offered to those that work in the building. See a video of these planned amenities by clicking here . Please take a moment to: 1) Review the BRiC’s proposed opportunities below 2) Complete this form to show your support to updating zoning laws which will allow BRiC to continue its vision as an ecosystem for innovation as it did when IBM occupied the campus HELP IMPROVE OUR COMMUNITY NOTE: By filling out this form, you are only showing support for the rezoning , not the proposed master plan concept itself nor its collection or individual parts. BRiC will be working with the City to determine the final best use and infrastructure planning that will yield maximum benefit. In addition to clicking your support, let us know if you or someone else you know would like an in-person tour .

Crocker Partners to Offer YMCA Ready to Work Summer Camp On-site at Boca Raton Innovation Campus Crocker Partners has donated 5,000 square feet of space at their Boca Raton Innovation Campus to the YMCA of South Palm Beach County. The space will be used for a Ready to Work Summer Camp being offered exclusively to BRiC’s 36 tenant companies and roughly 5,000 employees as they return to campus following the lifting of state and county stay-at-home orders. Summer camps eye Boca Raton offices, vacant buildings for extra space BOCA RATON, Fla. (CBS12) — Some Palm Beach County parents are facing a difficult predicament with childcare as summer begins. At the same time that many workplaces are beginning to end work-from-home practices, many kids are now finding themselves home without school work or other organized activities like camps and sports to occupy their time. Beginning next week, the YMCA will begin hosting some camps at the \"Boca Raton Innovation Campus\" otherwise known as the \"BRiC\" building off of Yamato Road. That camp will serve children of \"BRiC\" employees, but Hagensick says he's still searching for more space to expand other summer camp programs. Junior League of Boca Raton’s Diaper Bank Relocates to Boca Raton Innovation Campus Through Crocker Partners’ Storage Space Donation The Junior League of Boca Raton is thrilled to announce a major in-kind gift from Crocker Partners, which is donating approximately 1,500 square feet of space at its Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC), former IBM headquarters and birthplace of the personal computer, to the Junior League’s Diaper Bank. The space will be used to store and distribute more than 600,000 diapers each year which serves 2,000 children annually through the Junior League’s partnerships with 22 local agencies. The diaper bank has distributed over 4 million diapers since 2011 and is the largest diaper bank in Palm Beach County. « 1 … 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 … 52 » Contact Management Office 5000 T-Rex Avenue, Suite 160 Boca Raton FL 33431 561.807.6932 Events Manager Kisha Cools Security 561.443.3664 Tenant Services Coordinator Yaritza Luciano Join our mailing list for the latest BRiC news & events! × [[[[\"field8\",\"contains\",\"Other\"]],[[\"show_fields\",\"field17\"]],\"and\"]] 1 Step 1 Never miss a BRiC minute Join our mailing list for the latest BRiC news & events!
