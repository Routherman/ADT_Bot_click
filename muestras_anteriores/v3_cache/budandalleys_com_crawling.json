Located right on the waterfront in Seaside, Bud & Alley's is somewhat a classic gathering place, founded already in 1987 and still going very strong. Serving good food and good times, there are both indoor and outdoor dining areas on the ground floor, but the very best spot is the second floor rooftop terrace and bar, providing fantastic views over the Gulf. The restaurant serves fresh farm-to-table (or water-to-table) American and seafood dishes for both lunch and dinners. If you are not hungry, the Bud & Alley's rooftop bar is probably the best place around to grab a specialty cocktail or a glass of wine and watch the sun set in the ocean.
