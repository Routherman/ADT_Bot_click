Back to top of page TENNIS / PICKLEBALL If you enjoy racquet sports, Cape Coral has several parks with outdoor tennis courts, parks with dual-use tennis/pickleball courts. Players are responsible for providing their own equipment at all facilities. Tennis Although the tennis courts at the Yacht Club Community Park are currently closed, several parks (shown below) offer free play on a first-come, first-served basis. Pickleball For those unfamiliar with the latest sports craze, pickleball is a sport similar to badminton, tennis, and ping pong but has its differences. It is played with a hard paddle and a polymer smaller version of a wiffle ball on a court that is similar to a doubles badminton court. Because this game is easy to learn and less strenuous on aging joints than tennis, pickleball courts have been popping up throughout Lee County to help accommodate the increasing demand. Options for creating these courts include adding different colored pickleball lines to existing tennis courts for a reduced court size (joint use), converting seldom-used tennis courts into pickleball courts, and constructing stand-alone pickleball courts. There are several parks within the City of Cape Coral that have tennis/pickleball courts which are available for public use at no charge and open from sunrise to sunset (or later for locations with lighting). The courts may be utilized on a first-come, first-served basis; however, please be courteous and restrict your time when others are waiting to use them . Court locations include: Burton Memorial Park - One (1) asphalt tennis court - no lights Camelot Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts with lights - open until 9:00 p.m. daily Gator Trails Park - Two (2) dedicated pickleball courts with lights Giuffrida Park - Two (2) dedicated pickleball courts  - no lights Jim Jeffers Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts with lights - open until 9:00 p.m. daily; and two (2) warm-up pickleball courts Joe Stonis Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts with lights - open until 9:00 p.m. daily Lake Kennedy Racquet Club - 32 dedicated pickleball courts and 12 tennis courts Lake Meade Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts - This GO Bond-funded Park is scheduled to open in 2025 Sands Park - Four (4) dedicated pickleball courts Think it's too hot to play outside?

Rotary Park Environmental Center : 5505 Rose Garden Blvd, (239) 549-4606 This park, which is set on 97 acres of natural beauty, is considered the “Great Florida Birding Site.\"  As part of the Florida Birding Trail, birdwatching is an extremely popular activity at Rotary Park. * Resident Wildlife: Wading birds, raptors, migrant songbirds, butterflies, foxes and other mammals. Saratoga Lake Park : 170 SE 4th Terrace * Resident Wildlife : Burrowing Owls Sirenia Vista Park : Ceitus Parkway & Old Burnt Store Road *Resident Wildlife : Manatees abundant November – February, occasionally rest of the year. Strausser BMX Sports Complex : 1410 SW 6th Place * Resident Wildlife : Active Bald Eagle nest Veterans Park : 4140 Coronado Parkway * Resident Wildlife : Burrowing Owls Please be advised that there is proper etiquette to follow when viewing wildlife : Observe posted rules for safe distances while viewing wildlife. Getting close enough to an animal to make it react is too close, and you should back away immediately. You may approach as close as 20 ft to an owl’s nest, but must remain 150 ft from the eagle’s nest. Please DO NOT feed the wildlife! There are stiff penalties for wildlife harassment, especially for threatened species. Wildlife is best enjoyed when one is quietly observing their natural behavior. If you are interested in helping with wildlife conservation, the Cape Coral Friends of Wildlife volunteer group is great place to get involved. Please visit their website: www.ccfriendsofwildlife.org for more information, or for more details about wildlife viewing in Cape Coral, please contact the Environmental Recreation staff at Rotary Park - (239) 549-4606 .

Back to top of page TENNIS / PICKLEBALL If you enjoy racquet sports, Cape Coral has several parks with outdoor tennis courts, parks with dual-use tennis/pickleball courts. Players are responsible for providing their own equipment at all facilities. Tennis Although the tennis courts at the Yacht Club Community Park are currently closed, several parks (shown below) offer free play on a first-come, first-served basis. Pickleball For those unfamiliar with the latest sports craze, pickleball is a sport similar to badminton, tennis, and ping pong but has its differences. It is played with a hard paddle and a polymer smaller version of a wiffle ball on a court that is similar to a doubles badminton court. Because this game is easy to learn and less strenuous on aging joints than tennis, pickleball courts have been popping up throughout Lee County to help accommodate the increasing demand. Options for creating these courts include adding different colored pickleball lines to existing tennis courts for a reduced court size (joint use), converting seldom-used tennis courts into pickleball courts, and constructing stand-alone pickleball courts. There are several parks within the City of Cape Coral that have tennis/pickleball courts which are available for public use at no charge and open from sunrise to sunset (or later for locations with lighting). The courts may be utilized on a first-come, first-served basis; however, please be courteous and restrict your time when others are waiting to use them . Court locations include: Burton Memorial Park - One (1) asphalt tennis court - no lights Camelot Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts with lights - open until 9:00 p.m. daily Gator Trails Park - Two (2) dedicated pickleball courts with lights Giuffrida Park - Two (2) dedicated pickleball courts  - no lights Jim Jeffers Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts with lights - open until 9:00 p.m. daily; and two (2) warm-up pickleball courts Joe Stonis Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts with lights - open until 9:00 p.m. daily Lake Kennedy Racquet Club - 32 dedicated pickleball courts and 12 tennis courts Lake Meade Park - Two (2) tennis courts -OR- Four (4) pickleball courts - This GO Bond-funded Park is scheduled to open in 2025 Sands Park - Four (4) dedicated pickleball courts Think it's too hot to play outside?
