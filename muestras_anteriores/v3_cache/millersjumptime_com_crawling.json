FAQs Payment What are you payment options? We accept all major credit cards include American Express. We also accept payments via Apple Pay and Google Pay. Do you offer Finance? We no longer off Finance. The market for musical instrument finance changed during COVID and now most offers are between 15% and 24% APR. We believe there are far better deals for our customers available in the consumer finance market. How does Rental work? Our rental scheme is one our most popular and accessible services. With hundreds of instruments renting, we maintain an entire fleet and provide them for you to get started or get back into music. Find our more on our dedicated Rental Scheme Page Returns How can I return an item? The first step is to get in touch with our customer service time who can advise on the best process for your particular item. What is your Returns policy? Because of the nature of the items we sell we have different policies to cover these different areas. Our guiding principle is that we won't you to be satisfied with your purchase, that's why if you're considering a larger item we would recommend you visit our showroom to select. You can find full details of our returns policy here What happens if a product develops a fault? Many of the products we sell are covered by a comprehensive manufacturer warranty or by our own warranty. In the first instance get in touch so we can determine the problem and discuss next steps. Delivery Can I collect my order? Yes, absolutely. However unless it is a smaller item most of our products are stored off site and so you should wait until you receive confirmation of collection before making a journey. I have a specific requirement for my delivery. How can I organise this? Just contact our team who will be happy to discuss the best option for you. Can you collect my old piano? We certainly can collect. The best service really depends on whether you're looking to sell, part-exchange , or donate your instrument to our Piano Equals scheme . Tuning and Service Do you tune in my area? Our piano tuning service is available across East Anglia. We have online booking software available 24/7 here If you are unsure then please contact us for more information. Do you buy secondhand instruments? In short, yes. We believe one of the best ways to make the music industry more sustainable is to encourage reuse of quality musical instruments. We buy, sell, part-exchange, and donate pianos. You can find out more and apply here . We can part-exchange String instruments. For all other instruments we would encourage you to find a suitable specialist who can help. Do you repair other instruments? Repairing instruments and extending their life is extremely important. The skills loss in the UK is huge and we believe in trying to increase the longevity of instruments where we can. We work with a number of specialists who can offer repairs on digital pianos, string instruments, and french policy. Contact us for more information. Sustainability What is your policy regarding Sustainability? Musical instruments have historically been very repairable and lasted decades, even centuries. Sadly in many areas we have seen this reversed with products not lasting as long as becoming less repairable. At Millers Music our impact on the environment is something we take very seriously. we work to minimise our impact and improve the lives of those in our communities. We have a number of schemes and initiatives we run in order to achieve this and there is more information on our progress on our Sustainability page . What is WEEE? WEEE or the Waste Electrical and Electronic equipment recycling scheme to give it its full title is a specialist part of the waste and recycling industry. In the piano industry this can apply to digital pianos, keyboards, synths but can also to apply to products requiring a battery such as piano lamps. How does your instrument donation scheme work? We believe in tackling the issues with sustainability and the growing inequality in music provision. There are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of quality instruments already in the UK. We want to put these to use by reusing them where possible and if not recycling them. You can find out more about our instrument donation schemes here https://millersmusic.co.uk/pages/piano-equals Delivery Can I collect my order? I have a specific requirement for my delivery.
