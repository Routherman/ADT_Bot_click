Caron was at the forefront of organizing countless details each year that go into another successful season at Camp. And, importantly, she set the standard for customer service and care that families and community members have come to expect from Wenonah. Caron began her career with Wenonah in 1999 as the Manager of the Camping and Outdoor Bookstore. From there, she took on the role of Director of Administration for Wenonah Day Camp. She soon assumed responsibility for all administration in our Burlington Office and, through that work, built a legacy focussed on organization, logistics, customer service, and attention to detail. While we have always known that Caron goes above and beyond in everything she does, we were so pleased when her work was acknowledged by the global Camp community when she was honoured as the first ever Oak inductee into the Camp Admin Hall of Fame in 2019. Caron and her husband Mike live in Burlington. They are the proud grandparents of three granddaughters and four grandsons. Matt Burke Associate Director About Matt Matt’s history with Wenonah dates back to 1996, when he first attended as a camper and, the next year, as a POLARIS and WCIT participant.

Matt always makes himself available to lead or help with projects around Camp, including leading teams during our Wenonah Builds weekends, as well as building the Moustache Lounge (now The Rectory). He also frequently helps with the opening of Camp in early Spring. Matt is a recipient of the Schaefer Scholarship for his outstanding contributions to life at Camp, and an active member of the Friends Of Wenonah alumni group. Matt is a graduate of Sir Sandford Fleming College, where he received his Certificate of Arboriculture. He currently works at Lakeridge Ski Resort, where he is the Outdoor Operations Supervisor.

LEAVE YOUR REVIEW HERE Click To Review HERES WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING Cindy Bronson      2019 Exactly what I needed to help me refresh my spirit. Beautifully maintained, quiet, and a perfect spot to enjoy the outdoors. Close enough to sites but not too close that it interfers with a peaceful vacation. Anyone who rides a motorcycle will love the serenity of the back roads. Leland Reynolds      Dec 2019 Great Atmosphere and Great people. Everyone is super nice and its like a little community. The facility is well maintained. Pool is clean and fun. The restrooms are clean, maintained and well stocked. I was not aware that they also have a few cabins that can be rented if you don't have a camper but still enjoy the outdoors. It is a great place to bring family, friends and your horses. Sandy Steinruck      Nov 2019 We went with friends and horses to the Apex Trailhead campground. We loved it and have been talking about going back and bringing other horse friends with us. The facilities were all nice and relatively new. The stalls in the barns were large and very clean, with lights, hoses and running water outside the stalls. They also had paddocks where we could turn the horses out. The trails in Goethe State Park were beautiful, well maintained and well marked. The campground was very nice and clean, with large campsites. Amberay was very helpful and welcoming. Lauren Miller      Nov 2019 Went in October. The campground is well maintained, super clean and the stalls were as well. Amberay was able to help up with all our questions. The trails were well maintained. We will be going back. Thank you. Cindy Labrie 2019      This place was great. The staff was friendly. And it's close to everything you'd want to do in Dunnellon. And far enough out for privacy. Mitzi Crouse      2018 This is our second year staying here with our horses. Owners are easy to get hold of and friendly. The RV spots are large and fairly level. Both horse and nonhorse campers are friendly. Excellent horse facilities with large stalls, several turnout paddocks, an arena, and a round pen. We have also rented a large pasture both by the day and by the month. Trails across the street. Many, many other horse trails from 5 -35 minutes away. Clean bathhouse. We will be coming back again! “Incredible Relaxation!” Reviewed October 15, 2013 My husband and I have been coming here at least twice a month and we can't get enough! The staff are fantastic and wonderful hosts they make your stay very comfortable. The owner is incredible... Our last trip there we took our horses since the accommodations are perfect! Huge stalls and paddocks that are spacious. We will make this our home someday for sure... Rates for camping and stalls are reasonable and the grounds are immaculate! If you are coming from the northern regions and you are looking for peace and quiet for your snowbird stay... then this is absolutely the place for you! Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple “Weekend getaway” Reviewed September 3, 2013 Stayed at Trailhead Ranch for the Labor Day weekend and had a great time. Guess people just don't know about this place because we had plenty of room, unlike some crowded resorts we have been to. Our spot was beautiful with panoramic views of a large, hilly horse pasture. Met some great people here and made plans to hook up with them again. The owner and campground hosts were most accommodating. The whole place is clean and neat. Has a great swimming pool and excellent horse facilities. Will definitely be back! RS Best Campground in South East. This campground is the best one that I have ever visited! Its clean, pristine, quiet, and all around fabulous! The people here treat me like family. There are over 70 large campsites that will accommodate big rigs with full hook ups, without it feeling crowded. Did I mention quiet? They like children, and tents. Everyone here, from the campers to the owners are exceptional people. The Goethe State Park is right across the road with 120 miles of trails for hiking, bicycling, or horse back riding. They have stalls here, and will take care of your horses for you, or you can care for them yourself. Its a wonderful vacation for you and your horse. OR, if you don't have a horse, there is a trail riding group down the road. If you don't ride, no problem. There is still a great amount to do. There are rivers and lakes all around, with boat rentals. There is the Rainbow river, which is a great tubing river. There is fishing, and if you like, hunting. There are beaches nearby, and large cities within short driving distances. Its a fabulous place for a camping vacation.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Rebecca  J. Great weekend! What a great find for me! Googled this place up and was more than pleased. We rode trails that seemed to never end and were just great. Went out Saturday and it was a bit dusty in a few place but after a fast rain early Sunday morning the trails were perfect! Definitely putting this on my return list. Great camp sites and totally convenient trail access. We moved in and never had to drive anywhere - all weekend was so relaxed! New facility - Clean and Friendly... Deb S. Really nice quiet park with level campsites.. those who are traveling with horses would be hard put to find a better place. Lots of trails in the national forest across the street. Lots of space between campers and a nice clean pool for the families who come. The restrooms were spotless and the owner very helpful. We really enjoyed the... Toni B. We stayed here with our horses in March/April 2013 and loved it. The trailer sites are large and level - there is no crowding. The grounds are immaculate with all paved roads and grassy sites with many trees planted which will eventually give shade to the sites. Pool clear and clean. So nice not to deal with mud around the..

The trailer area is immaculate and the horse area has everything you could possibly need, arena, round pen, lots of turnouts, large stalls, hitching posts. The trails are nice but fairly limited in interest, however, there are tons of trails within a short distance that you can trailer to for a change. Loads of beautiful tourist towns around with lots of opportunity for recreation. We loved it and will be back. -Sue and Rich Hagerman April 14, 2013 From Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/goethetrailheadranch/app_312697795464859 What a great find!

      "text": "Goethe RV Trailhead Ranch - by Elise Stassart Shakespearean Trails Subscribe Sign in Goethe RV Trailhead Ranch Dunnelon, Florida Elise Stassart Jan 21, 2023 3 Share This campground is more and less than I expected. It is larger than I thought it would be. Right across the street is the Apex trailhead. Here are some sandhill cranes just hanging out. The campground is divided up into the camping area - where the RVs are parked. About half the campers are non-equestrians. Everyone has full hook-up. They only rent by the month. So, you have to pay for a full month whether you use it or not. It is $710/month for full hook-up. There is WIFI, which is excellent, but it is only available in the lounge. There is a building used as a mail drop and you are expected to pay $10 a month to receive your mail, but you could have your mail sent and they probably wouldn’t know. The owners are fairly absentee. They drive through on a regular basis to check on things, but are pretty much no contact. There are large turn-out paddocks for the horses, but you are not allowed to feed hay. There is no grass and no shade. The paddocks are mostly sand, which is OK, because the horses enjoy lying down in it. You are only allowed to put them out in the paddocks during the day. At night, the horses are put away in their stalls. $400 per horse for a month. We paid an extra $100 to rent a stall next to our horses to use for our tack and feed. You are not allowed to bring horses into the campground area. We are riding the same trails as Hernando de Soto and his troops back in 1539 as de Soto mapped out La Florida for the Spanish crown. The trails are flat and sandy. There are a few wet areas, but for the most part it is dry and easy riding. There are several equestrian campers here who come here every winter to escape the snow. They have a 5 pm happy hour and they do group rides. They are a very nice group. 3 Share Discussion about this post Comments Restacks Top Latest Discussions No posts Ready for more?
