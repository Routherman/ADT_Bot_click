You want everyone to have a great time at your event! We live to make that happen for you. In fact, our mission is to knock it out of the park and make every event we play a smashing success. We thrive off of seeing people have a wonderful time, which plays into our larger vision as a band. Ultimately, we want to bring together friends, families, coworkers, and other partygoers to create fun-filled experiences that everyone can look back on with fondness long after the party’s over. We’ve been working toward that vision now for more than 27 years. Curious to know how it all started? The Start and Evolution of The Grooves I’m Ron—bandleader of The Grooves—and I started out in an original band. I loved playing original music but it was tough to stay booked and busy. So I took a cue from the many booking agents who kept telling me that there were gigs to be booked and money to be made in playing covers. The band decided to give it a try and, once we did, we all agreed that we’d never had so much fun playing music. It was so rewarding to see guests having an absolute blast, dancing and singing along to their favorite songs. We were hooked! And we still are all these years later even though there have been some challenges along the way. Learning How to Fuel a Party One challenge we faced early on was figuring out which songs would hit the spot. We knew we couldn’t just play the songs we liked; we had to choose songs that would be entertaining for folks of all ages and get them on the dance floor when the occasion called for it. Whew… tricky! In addition to listening to people’s requests, we’ve tried hundreds of songs over the years to figure out which ones get the party started and keep it alive. Today we have 170+ of the most loved songs of all time songs in our repertoire to entertain and impress your guests. Working Hard For Clients Like You Additionally, we had a bit of a learning curve when it came to figuring out what people needed in terms of information, event planning help, and reassurance so that they could feel confident in booking The Grooves. We did (and still do) a lot of listening to clients to figure those things out. Has it paid off? You bet! Our clients will tell you that they love our friendly and responsive communication style. Not to mention our thorough process to make sure that you have all the info you need from us and we have all the equipment and info we need to contribute to a spectacular event that goes off without a hitch. The Grooves Today Today, we are one of the most flexible bands in Texas. We can provide anywhere from a 3-piece to 10-piece band to accommodate your budget and any space restrictions, as well as to create the perfect vibe for your party. Not to mention that, over the years, we’ve created a huge collection of costumes and equipment that allows us to provide the best experience for any event. And, outside of our amazing band, we also work with some of the best talent in Austin. For example, we can call in dancers to give your event an extra wow factor or a DJ to keep people dancing in between our sets. We’re a true one-stop-shop. When you book us, you won’t have to worry at all about entertainment. As long as you let us know what you need, you can trust that we’ve got all the bases covered! Starting to Notice a Theme? With The Grooves, it all comes back around to you and your guests. If you ask us, getting a great result for you and creating amazing, memorable experiences for your guests is what it’s all about! We can’t wait to start your party! Sincerely, Ron and The Grooves Keeping Texas Entertained The Grooves band travels throughout Texas to provide high-end entertainment for weddings, corporate events, fundraisers, and private parties. We’re one of the top Texas bands for hire in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. We also play in Abilene, Midland, Fort Worth, Tyler, Bryan and College Station, New Braunfels, and all other towns in the great state of Texas. ✮ Excellent The Grooves Dance Band 4.9 Nicole Sword The Grooves Dance Band performed at my in laws 50th wedding anniversary in Tyler, Texas.

The prep work was made simple and requests were handled with grace..On the day of the event, the ensemble showed up as expected, set up in a neat and orderly fashion, and engaged in conversation with other folks that were there and setting up as well. When it was time to perform, ALL expectations were met! The music was the right volume, the songs were fun and festive, they honored the requests I made in song choices prior to the event, and they engaged our audience. There was not a single complaint from any guest and in fact, we had the most compliments we've had about a group since beginning our fundraising event over 10 years ago. A few folks even asked me for their contact information at the event..We are thankful for their time, their expertise, and the enthusiasm for what they do. We have already asked them to be part of next year's fundraiser! The Grooves is a band that we hope to be in relationship with for years to come.

My uncle is a music producer in LA, so we knew we had to have a great band. The Grooves didn't disappoint! They were excellent in taking in our music preferences ahead of time, professional and so well-equipped. We wanted a lot of country songs, but also Frank Sinatra and classics as well as modern dance favorite. The Grooves are so versatile, they performed them all with ease. It was very special to get to hear all our favorites. Even my uncle (who co-hosts the Grammy's) was impressed! Response from the owner: Thanks so much for the kind words!

They kept it going full charge all night, which made for an amazingly great, fun-filled, unforgettable evening of celebration for the happy couple! Their light show added a lot to the ambiance, too. I can’t recommend The Grooves highly enough! Response from the owner: Thanks so much for having us at the wedding reception! You folks were such a blast to perform for! Best party ever!

Our guests loved the band, as they played all the right songs to keep the dance floor PACKED all night long! Being a bride, you love to have a vendor that shows up and shows out and Ron and The Grooves did just that.

Thanks for the great show !! Response from the owner: You rock Tim! Love to see the dance floor packed with such a fun crowd! Anthony Medrano We had The Grooves perform at our wedding this past weekend. They performed outstandingly. Numerous people that attended loved every moment of every song. “At Last” was the first song sang, and guests thought it was a recording. One guest did inform me that she had chills from the vocalist. The same goes for a bunch of songs. I highly recommend The Grooves to perform at any event you want to party. Response from the owner: Thank you so much Anthony! it was an honor to perform for such an amazing wedding reception with such fun folks! Betsy Blount We hired The Grooves band for our wedding and it was one of the best decisions we made! Everyone kept telling us how awesome the band was. They truly play to the crowd to try to keep the party going. They have a fairly large song selection too. Our friends and family had the time of their lives. My husband woke up the next morning and told me I had thrown him the best party of his life lol! Ron was so great to work with, very responsive! I can’t say enough good things about this band. The only bad thing of the night was that it ended too soon. We wanted to stay longer! I would hire them 10x over again. If you’re thinking about it, do it. It’s a game changer for any event, especially a wedding! Response from the owner: Thank you so much for the amazingly kind words! It was an honor performing for your special day and a total blast rocking out for such a fun crowd! I wish you both all the best! Paula Williams These guys ROCKED the house at Redberry Estate over the weekend with some great classic and modern music. Very classy, high energy, and funkadelic! Response from the owner: Hi Paula!

Can’t recommend Amy and Avenue Q events enough! Amazing wedding planner and always spot on at the events! Lee S. Bortner The Grooves are awesome!

It was so great seeing you two and working with you at the wedding reception! Your wedding photos are amazing! Amanda Worrell The Grooves are by far the best dance band around.

We had a blast at the reception and loved watching you folks cut a rug on the dance floor! Staci Roberts We had a 50th Anniversary party scheduled in March for my parents and when Covid hit and everything closed down Ron made sure we did not worry that they would work with us on rescheduling. We finally rescheduled for July and we had such a great time. The band checked with us ahead of time for all the plans, they showed up on time and ready to perform, they were so kind and made sure we had a great time. The music was fun and kept the dance floor full. All of our guest loved the band and made sure to comment on them. We would highly recommend The Grooves and would use them again for any event they are fun, full of energy, and sound amazing.. Response from the owner: Thank you so much for the review Staci! The party was so much fun and you all were such fun folks to rock out with! Let's do it again in 50 years for the next 50th anniversary party! Zach Ronhaar Awesome wedding band!

Please give us a shout for your next party, it was a blast! All the best! Claire Fallin The Grooves Dance Band was AMAZING! They played perfectly to our wedding guests and made our reception a blast! They provided a wide variety of song styles and were able to play everything from vintage jazz to modern pop songs.

We would highly recommend hiring them for any event you're looking to make fun and enjoyable for your guests! Response from the owner: Thanks so much for having us for your special day!

Response from the owner: Thanks again for having us! Such a fun crowd and the party was a blast! jamie phillips The Grooves were awesome! We had them play our company Christmas Party.

Response from the owner: Thanks so much for having us! it was a blast and we're all looking forward to rocking with you again next year! Monica Cuellar Hired this band for a fall festival and they were fabulous!! It was outdoors and cold, they didn't complain once. They did such an amazing job. Each one of their performers were fabulous. Highly recommend The Grooves to anyone looking for a band. Response from the owner: Thanks for having us! You folks rocked the dance floor and we’re so much fun! Marcia D Love, love, love this band. They had our entire group on their feet and knew just what an over-55 group likes. Can't wait to hear them again!! Response from the owner: Thanks so much, you folks were a total blast! Donna London The Grooves played at our daughter's wedding at the end of August. We had never met and/or heard the band in person until the day of her wedding. Our daughter and now husband listened to their clip that was on Gigsalad and the venue also recommended them. We were highly impressed with their vocals as well as their song choices plus the songs that we had requested. They were prompt, professional, and reasonable. If you are searching for a band (not a DJ), we would highly recommend that you seek out this group. We had a wonderful time as did our guests and were very pleased with The Grooves! Response from the owner: Thank you so much for the kind words, it was a pleasure performing for you! We wish you all the best and thanks so much for a rocking fun night! Amanda Austin Here's Your Wedding Band!We can't say enough positive words about The Grooves! They are absolutely fantastic! Ron was so easy to work with and very responsive to all our questions (even while he was on vacation!). During the reception, our dance floor was packed! We heard so many great comments from our guests such as \"they are the best wedding band\" and \"they're so awesome!\" Book them today!!-Amanda and Ed Austin Response from the owner: Thanks so much! It was awesome performing for you! Such cool folks, and tons of fun! Kay Rust What an amazing night! The Groves were fan-fabulous! If I heard once, I heard multiple times what a great band we booked. Having the ability to accommodate an age group ranging from 25 years old to 85 years young, playing what was requested, adjusting to the crowd, mixing things up, exceeding my expectations in loudness, softness, having quality singers with superb musicians dressing the part were all factors in our Opa Social being a wonderful success.
