      "text": "Dining Notes: Gas Knob and Truffles close doors St. Johns deputies shoot suspect who's had 'numerous encounters with law enforcement' News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals FOOD Dining Notes: Gas Knob and Truffles close doors Liz Van Hooser I'm hoping this column will not turn into the obituary section for restaurants this year, although it seems likely some closings will continue. Restaurant News, a trade publication that follows the restaurant industry, is predicting Florida and West Virginia will experience the most anemic restaurant growth in the Southeast region - about 1.8 percent. For a state accustomed to robust growth, boosted by tourism and population growth, 2009 will likely be another difficult year.Last week I learned the Gas Knob , next to the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena closed, as did Truffles Cafe and Bakery in Mandarin.I will continue to report closings as I learn of them. But, I'll also be sharing success stories. JJ Vigoureaux called me last week with a good one.This month, he's celebrating 15 years of business at his JJ's Liberty Bistro in Ponte Vedra Beach and five years at JJ's Bistro de Paris on Gate Parkway. To mark the milestones, customers will receive a complimentary glass of champagne and half off all desserts with a dinner entree purchase. And Friday and Saturday, JJ's Liberty Bistro will continue its prix fixe multi-course meal. For $100 (not including tax and tip), the seven-course meal includes a sampling of five Cotes Du Rhone wines.Vigoureauxmoved to Jacksonville in 1991 to become the food and beverage manager at the Marsh Landing Country Club.Originally from France, Vigoureaux had wanted to open his own place for years. In the mid-'90s, while in his early 30s, his dream finally came together after getting loans from the Small Business Administration and his father. JJ's Liberty Bistro opened in February of 1994.The concept was close to home for Vigoureaux: a French bistro with authentic French dishes and an unmatched wine list from the old country.It's the kind of place where you can order a cheese plate with Petit Basque, a sheep cheese from the Basque region of France, on a toasted baguette. Or foie gras, the controversial dish made from fattened duck or goose liver. It's the kind of place where, if you're like me, you have to point to what you want because the entrees are all in French.In addition to fine dining, Liberty Bistro has a market selling items such as cheese and cavier, as well as meals to go.JJ's also does catering.Although he said his restaurants are doing well, he has had to cut costs. For example, Vigoureaux said he had cut a manager position and now works at the restaurant 80 hours a week. \"In this economy, you have to try to keep costs down while giving the same quality to costumers,\" he said.Vigoureaux said he hopes locals will chose to spend their dining dollars on locally owned restaurants.\"People are complaining about places closing, saying how sad it is,\" he said. \"But when was the last time they ate at one of these places that have closed?\" Bites - Plaza III, The Steakhouse , located downtown at the Hyatt Regency , will no longer be open for lunch. Instead, the restaurant will open at 4 p.m. daily, with a happy hour from 5-7 p.m. In a news release, owners J. Bard and Linda McLean said they would be focusing on planned parties, special events and receptions during weekday hours. Jacksonville's Plaza III is one of five locations throughout the nation for the steak house that originated in Kansas City, Mo.- The hip Murray Hill eatery 1171 , as in 1171 Edgewood Ave., will be hosting a cooking class from 1-3 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 8, and subsequently on the first Sunday of every month. The classes, which include a cooking demonstration, sampling and a glass of wine, will be led by Fernando Silveira , chef and owner, and Karolyn Cantin , former owner of the Village Cafe in Ortega and 1171's director of catering. The Sunday, Feb. 8, class will focus on making a romantic dinner and includes a seafood and meat dish as well as two desserts and appetizers. The class costs $45 if you sign up a week before or $50 after that. Call (904) 384-3160 to register. December's class focused on entertaining, and students got a copy of a recipe for pistachio-encrusted chicken with pureed mango chutney. liz.vanhooser@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4697 Looking for a free mini puzzle?

What-I-think2 Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida 133 107 Reviewed 27 May 2017 via mobile One more try a bust! There are so many great choices in the area we decided to give this place another try. Unfortunately we remembered why it had been s long since we'd been here. We had the six course prix fix menu. The first course was a piece of dry beef on a crunchy toast point with a dopple of goat cheese. Nothing to write home about, the cured meat was salty and the toast dry and crunchy. The second course, pork belly and scallop. The very thin slices of scallop were delicious and the mushroom ice cream interesting. It was suppose to melt into a sauce but that didn't occur. The pork belly was almost all fat. Truly five slabs of white opaque fat. These I left on my plate. The server even commented on how these could be chewing and he'd advise the kitchen. Nothing more was said to us. The caesar salad was excellent the best course of the meal. The next course was sorbet. The duck ravioli was sweet and the pasta house made infused with blueberries. These big blue discs were drowned in a thin brown sauce on top of squash and zucchini slices. It looked unappealing and not the savory rich flavor I was expecting. The beef Wellington was ok. Overall, for the service, the decor, the price and the meal, we'd select other fine dining venues in the local area. The total bill is what would we have paid for a special occasion at Medure for a meal with much more overall satisfaction.

Great wine selection too. We had our 50th anniversary party here last July and it too was very well done -- with 3 menus to choose from so our group of about 30 all had a choice of fish, chicken or beef for the main dish, plus sit-down service. we received many compliments on the quality of the food and wine, plus the staff did a great job of decorating the tables and seeing that everyone had good service. The dinner we had in April was just for the 2 of us. We loved that the restaurant is much quieter than most places.
