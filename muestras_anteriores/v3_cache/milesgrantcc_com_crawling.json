History of Miles Grant Country Club The Miles Grant golf course opened in 1972, but the land on which it stands was part of a Spanish land grant from the King of Spain to settler Samuel Miles in 1813. Five square miles of land bordering the Santa Lucia River (now St. Lucie) was given as compensation for shipping and logistical support rendered by Miles to the Spanish territorial government. Miles originally established a sawmill on the property to produce building materials for the influx of settlers who soon followed and the colonization of the east central Florida coastal region was under way. Today, we find the established residential community of Miles Grant that provides social and recreational activities for the folks living in the houses and condominiums bordering the golf course. Stuart Area Stuart was named “The Sailfish Capital of the World” and “ 2016 America’s Happiest Seaside Town ” by Coastal Living magazine. Perfectly located on the Intracoastal Waterway along what’s known as the “Treasure Coast of Florida,” it boasts great weather for fishing, boating and other water sports. The quaint downtown area hosts fine dining, The Lyric Theatre, galleries, wonderful one-of-a-kind shops, and a Riverwalk. Not far from Stuart, on Hutchison Island, is The Elliott Museum. This unique museum features history of the Treasure Coast as well as exhibits of cars, baseball, art, and more. Across the road is the Oceanographic Coastal Center, an educational and research site featuring a lagoon of fish and turtles, a tank for observing and feeding stingrays, as well as several nature trails. Closer to the Miles Grant community is the town of Port Salerno. At the marina you can watch local fishermen come in with their catch, shop the stores where local artists exhibit their crafts, and enjoy good food, beverage and fellowship at your choice of several restaurants and bars. Ride your bike to nearby Sandsprit Park. Located on the St. Lucie River and Manatee Pocket, the park has pavilions and a playground for family fun and picnics, outdoor exercise stations, and a boardwalk with benches for relaxing at the water’s edge. For the fisherman, long piers stretch like fingers into the water, or you can launch your boat at the public ramps. Click Here to see a picture gallery of some of our favorite places and activities around our area. Area Wildlife We host a diverse bird population. Green parrots take over trees and ground. These gregarious birds are easily recognized by their raucous calls. A pair of Egyptian geese are often spotted along the course. A white heron wades in the water under the bridge at the 18th. A pair of Sand Hill Cranes can be seen playing fetch with a stick in the grass near the Tennis Courts. The striking White Ibis is frequently seen on lawns looking for large insects. Small mammals like squirrel, fox, raccoon, rabbit, iguana and armadillo are also in our backyards. Several Gopher Tortoise have burrows along the perimeter road that provide shelter for at least 360 other animal species. Click Here to view a gallery of local wildlife. Amazing!
