Our friendly and welcoming service is built on a shared love of hospitality. Our ‘open to all’ policy champions diversity and inclusivity in our teams and guests, never alienating or discriminating. We champion a real living wage and have always ensured the happiness and welfare of our colleagues are upheld with just as much importance as the standards we maintain for our guests. Hospitality is an enormously rewarding way of life. Our passion for providing warm and welcoming pubs for our guests and ensuring that they leave having had the best experiences we can offer never wanes. We love what we do, and that passion is infectious across our teams, who share our desire to be the very best version of ourselves at all times. Our award winning yet accessible food and drink offering uses a network of local and acclaimed suppliers and who share our love for the most amazing artisanal products, both from the UK and the wider global supply chain. Whether it’s a neighbour producing honey in the garden, the finest rare breed meats from our regenerative farming partners in Dorset or the most effervescent of English wines from local vineyards, the suppliers we work with love their trade as much as we love ours, and that makes a huge difference. Leadership Team James Lyon-Shaw Group Director Nick Solomides Recruitment & HR Andrea Richards Events and Marketing Mark Jarvis Operations Manager Doing it Right The BII Sustainability Champion Award is given to hospitality professionals who have gone above and beyond to demonstrate their commitment to running a sustainable business. We are proud to hold this award in all of our pubs and to be part of an environmentally aware award scheme that helps us do things the right way, not because we have to, but because we want to. Community Support Our longstanding partnership with The Windsor Homeless Project enables us to work toward closing the circle on our successes against the backdrop of the challenges faced by others in our community. Through fundraising support, weekly food donations, and work placement opportunities to help bring people back to work in a supportive and structured environment, we aim to serve the whole community, not just those with the means to join us as guests in the pub.
