More than a dozen local residents, interested in learning more about Clearwater’s history and visiting one of its iconic landmarks, took part in the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization February tour of the Fort Harrison , the Church’s international religious retreat. The monthly tour begins in the stately Fort Harrison lobby. Guests touring the Fort Harrison descend the stairs leading from the state-of-the-art auditorium to its lush gardens. The hotel was constructed in 1926 by Clearwater real estate developer Ed Haley and soon became a favorite of those visiting the city, including the Philadelphia Phillies, who lived in the hotel during spring training, and the Rolling Stones, who are rumored to have written ’Satisfaction’ there on their first U.S. tour. A highlight of the tour is the tenth floor Crystal Ballroom. Included in the original 1926 plans at the urging of the original architect, the ballroom provides guests with an expansive view of the bay. The Fort Harrison rooftop restaurant was open to locals and hotel guests during the 20’s and 30’s for nightly dinner dances with performances by the Fort Harrison Band. Today, the ballroom is home to a host of charitable events, including monthly Swing Dances for Charity and the Tampa Bay Charity Coalition bimonthly luncheons. In 1975, the Church of Scientology purchased the Fort Harrison as part of its Clearwater-based international spiritual headquarters. Every year, thousands of Scientologists from all over the world visit Clearwater for advanced religious services. The Church also hosts hundreds of community and nonprofit events at the Fort Harrison. The next tour is scheduled for March 17 at 1:30 p.m. To attend, or for more information about community events held at the Fort Harrison, contact Amber Skjelset, Scientology Information Center Manager, at (727) 467-6966 or email amber@cos.flag.org .

In Scientology, some upper levels of spiritual counseling require the parishionerâs full-time participation for a period of several weeks in order for the person to achieve the full spiritual benefits of the religious service. Thus, the Church maintains religious retreats, away from everyday distractions. These retreats provide the ideal environment for advanced religious studies and spiritual counseling. While freedom from distraction is important during all counseling, it is vital at the most advanced levels. ï»¿ « Previous What are Saint Hill and Advanced Organizations? Next » What is Flag?

Our Mission The Franciscan Retreat Center at Mount St. Francis provides a quiet, reflective place of beauty for people of all denominations for retreats, conferences, meetings, workshops, seminars, select celebrations or just time away. Our staff strives to combine the beauty of our surroundings with comfortable, simple, clean facilities and nutritious food. The Charism of the center is the Franciscan tradition of sharing, hospitality, and joyful service. ​ The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration was founded in Olpe, Germany in 1863 by Mother Theresia Bonzel, who was recently beatified by Pope Francis. The primary ministries of the Congregation,  which continue today, are: Living the Gospel; Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament; Caring for the sick, elderly, poor and powerless; Education; and Responding to unmet needs of others. In 1875, the political unrest in Germany made the further growth of the Congregation impossible, curbing many of the activities to the religious life of the Sisters. Receiving an invitation from an American Bishop, the sisters headed to the United States and arrived in Lafayette, Indiana, where they promptly established a hospital and a school. Their growth continued until 1932 when they decided to expand their ministry further west to Denver, Colorado. The Denver sisters were blessed with the gift of a large estate (formerly The Modern Woodmen of America Tuberculosis Sanatorium) in Colorado Springs. In 1954, the sisters moved to Colorado Springs and named their campus Mount St. Francis. The Mount is “home” to all of the Sisters of St. Francis, and particularly to the sisters who live and minister here. In addition to being their home, Mount St. Francis is also the location of their following ministries: MSF Nursing Center, Franciscan Community Counseling, St. Francis of Assisi Parish, Women Partnering and, of course, the Franciscan Retreat Center. Learn more about the Sisters of St. Francis and their dedicated mission and impact on their website. ​ ​In Aug. 2023, the Diocese of Colorado Springs took over the Retreat Center.

A Beautiful Addition to Downtown A Unified Vision The Urban Land Institute ← prev next → Flag Bright Future The Flag Building (left), the Fort Harrison (center) and the Oak Cove (right), individually, were massive projects by the Church of Scientology that serve the community in a multitude of ways. Now the Church is planning its next project. THE ATRIUM Standing at two stories tall, the Atrium of the Flag Building greets visitors and Scientologists alike with a visual display of the religion’s beliefs in statues of timeless bronze. The November 2013 announcement by Mr. David Miscavige, the ecclesiastic leader of the Scientology religion, that the religion’s Cathedral, the Flag Building, was completed, heralded another monumental project for the Scientology religion—the opening of L. Ron Hubbard Hall. In fact, Mr. Miscavige made that 2013 announcement inside a 40,000-square-foot marquee to some 10,000 Scientologists on the very ground upon which the 166,000-square-foot hall will be built. Quite apart from what it means for Scientologists and the fulfillment of a 40-year vision by the Scientology Founder to reawaken the perceptic powers of a spiritual being, the 377,000-square-foot 21st-century Flag Building infused 1,800 jobs and $282,000,000 into the Clearwater economy. The Flag Building followed the 2009 restoration of the historic Fort Harrison and 2007 renovation of the Oak Cove; each successive construction project bringing growth to the Church of Scientology as well as to the Clearwater economy. FORT HARRISON The iconic Fort Harrison Hotel opened in 1926 making it nearly a century old. Therefore, it was clear to the Church that the building needed to be brought up to modern-day standards. The Church, however, wanted to maintain the historical aspects of the beloved icon. It was done with 350 local construction workers (over one million man hours), 400 sheets of plans and 500 pages of construction specifications, 100,000 square feet of carpet, 100 miles of wire for power and communication systems and 8,000 feet of molding. It resulted in centralized air conditioning, new plumbing and wiring, eco-friendly insulation and energy-efficient lighting systems. Finer details incorporated into the restoration project have cemented the 1920s feel, look and luxury of the magnificent building. The stone flooring in the lobby was restored to its original checker pattern with a combination of brown St. Laurent marble from the South of France and Crema Marfil from Alicante, Spain. The steps of the Crystal Ballroom leading to the 11th-floor mezzanine and in the ballroom foyer contain yet another type of Spanish marble. The Crystal Ballroom chandelier is 400 pounds of 11,600 hand-cut and hand-polished crystal pieces lit by 52 lamps. Columns in the main Fort Harrison lobby are finished in gold leaf, add to that a total of 15,000 linear feet of gold leaf trim on the ceilings and walls of the building’s public areas. In all, the Fort Harrison religious retreat consists of 220 rooms, 3 restaurants offering different cuisines, a fitness center, swimming pool, poolside pavilion, tea room, conference center, two board rooms, auditorium with state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment and ballroom. The Church provides the board rooms, auditorium and ballroom to like-minded nonprofits for meetings and events at no charge. THE FORT HARRISON: A COMMUNITY HUB The Fort Harrison Auditorium sparkled with lively conversation. Guests from across Tampa Bay had gathered to enjoy an evening of entertainment and good company in the name of a good cause. The nonprofit Sunscreen Film Festival “Six till Sunscreen” fundraiser was opened with all the necessary show and pizzazz by Pinellas County Film Commissioner Tony Armer and fellow Sunscreen Film Festival board members. THE PERFECT LOCATION When the Sunscreen Film Festival needed a venue for their fundraiser, they chose the Fort Harrison. The bottom line: a five-star event with great food, great entertainment and a great result. 70 Events held in the Fort Harrison in 2019 The Fort Harrison religious retreat opens its doors to the community on a weekly basis. For nonprofits, the Church provides a five-star venue in which charities can reach their own benevolent goals, free of charge. Here is a sampling of events in the Fort Harrison Auditorium over the last 12 months: Pace Center for Girls Breakfast CCHR 4th Annual Purple Heart Banquet Volunteer Ministers Patriot Day Banquet Miracles Outreach Fashion Show 5th Annual Tampa Bay Charity Coalition Banquet Community Holiday Brunch Gentlemen’s Ball Against Human Trafficking Children with a Vision Inc. “Grandmother’s Gala” Laconian (Greek) Society Annual Dinner World Chefs Without Borders Fundraiser Stone Square Masonic Lodge 42, Mother’s Day Banquet United for Human Rights Champions for Freedom Awards Banquet 16th Annual Fashions with Flair & Silent Auction for Charity A Night for a Drug-Free World Concert Groupo Folklorico Mahetzi Dinner Love and Help Children Awards Banquet International Day of Happiness Celebration However, such events are not just held in the Auditorium. An elevator ride to the 10th floor brings you to the Fort Harrison’s Crystal Ballroom, that is however, as long as you don’t get distracted by the breathtaking view of the water surrounding the Clearwater Memorial Causeway from the Fort Harrison’s expansive patio. 10,628 Number of guests who visited the Fort Harrison for community events in 2019 A unique and beautifully restored historical venue, the Fort Harrison Crystal Ballroom provides a radiant atmosphere for nonprofits seeking to make a difference. Below is a sampling of events and nonprofits the Church has directly supported by providing the venue, food and services at no charge to the group: Swing Dance for Charity Clearwater Community Gardens 5th Annual Brunch Tampa Bay Charity Coalition Luncheon Drug-Free America Brunch International Day of Peace Banquet Sunscreen Film Festival Fundraiser Chaîne des Rôtisseurs Holiday Dinner SKAL Banquet Rays of Hope Fundraiser Volunteer Ministers Disaster Response Workshop Clearwater Hospitality Reception Walter’s Academy of Entrepreneurship Graduation 4th of July Dinner 6th Annual Chefs’ Showcase Children’s Charity I Am The Group Foundation Fundraiser Men & Women in Business Showcase Interfaith Round Table Discussion The American Culinary Federation Team USA is one of many repeat guests to use the Crystal Ballroom. The Church’s Fort Harrison chefs opened up their kitchens to work side by side with some of the best cuisine artists in the world and blend their culinary genius to cook for a cause. Most recently, these chefs joined forces to serve up deluxe fare alongside a sweet trumpet serenade and a classic ’50s dance performance. But beyond all things aesthetically pleasing, this night served a higher purpose. Funds raised from the tickets went to a nonprofit that is instrumental in laying a foundation for children of the community—the Pinellas Sheriff’s Police Athletic League Lealman. Opening our spaces to many nonprofits free of charge for their events gives them the extra boost they need to be able to achieve their goals. “Lending a hand and partnering with community groups to make a difference is a big deal to us,” said Lisa Mansell, public affairs director of the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization. “With many nonprofits, opening our spaces to them to hold their events free of charge gives them that extra boost they need to be able to achieve their goals.” Serving as a hub for charity, culture and arts, the Fort Harrison has been the heart and home to Tampa Bay community events since its first opening in 1926. The Church of Scientology carries on this tradition by opening its doors to charities to provide them with a venue where they can forward their messages for social betterment. Community goals achieved through such partnerships have become commonplace at the Fort Harrison. From hosting the color guard escorting the star-spangled banner to honor those who served at the annual Purple Heart Day Banquet to the annual Love and Help Children Awards Banquet, the Fort Harrison hosted 70 different community events with 44 different charities in 2019. One such charity was Children with a Vision Inc., who the Church hosted for their 6th Annual Grandmother’s Gala. “My grandmother was always a positive influence in my life,” said Tonya Lewis, founder of the nonprofit. “This is a way to give back.” “I’m so honored to be here,” said one 90-year-old grandmother and matriarch upon receiving her award on stage that day. She teared up when noting the crowd had sung to her on stage, “That was the highlight of my night, and I know I will be back next year.” Among the esteemed guests in attendance that evening was former Tampa police chief, and now Mayor Jane Castor, who addressed the crowd of hundreds on the importance of family and community. In doing so, she joined many community leaders before her who have stood together with nonprofits, community groups, the Church of Scientology and other like-minded individuals to forward a message of empowerment and betterment in the community. But what is a modern-day movement to enhance the community without good networking? Providing a place for charities to come together and get the tools they personally need to get on their feet and expand, the Tampa Bay Charity Coalition also meets bimonthly in the Fort Harrison. Sponsored by the Church of Scientology, the coalition has grown to over 200 participants, each seeking to work together with their peers to fortify the impact they have on the local community. “To be a good organization you have to put your heads together,” said Charity Coalition member Pastor Mary Rieves. “We go all over and service any community that needs help.” —Pastor Shonda Obi, ObiOne Global Ministries Rieves founded her nonprofit, Teaching Another Generation In Need (TAG-IN), to help youth from low-income families and the foster care system. Through her partnerships with fellow Charity Coalition members Dr. Veronica Walters, founder and president of Walters Academy for Entrepreneurship, and Pastor Shonda Obi of ObiOne Global Ministries, they’ve reached more children with their message together than they did alone. Said Obi: “We go all over and service any community that needs help.” EVENT NIGHT Friends and families regularly gather by the Fort Harrison pool to celebrate humanitarian accomplishments and to enjoy one another’s company. GETTING BACK TO THE FUTURE: L. RON HUBBARD HALL And while the Fort Harrison and Flag Building construction, renovation and restoration projects, along with their sister building, the Oak Cove, all combined meant $282 million into the hands of area architects, designers, technicians, construction workers and the city, L. Ron Hubbard Hall will mean another shot in the arm of Clearwater—expanding the city’s life blood over the Memorial Causeway from the beach and into the very heart of downtown. As designs are finalized, permits acquired and land prepared, the buzz is speeding around the globe. Thousands of Scientologists have heard the news of the hall and are spreading it like wildfire. THE FUTURE The Church of Scientology’s next project: L. Ron Hubbard Hall. Not only will it be for International Scientology Events but for the score of nonprofit charity events and galas in the Tampa Bay Area. The 3,600-seat event hall will have retractable seats that convert into a 1,500 banquet facility. And that’s just the main hall. The eight fixed-position cameras, five state-of-the-art robotic cameras and 30 translator stations channel the images and sounds from the event hall to the main control room. Lounges, dining and kitchen facilities, exhibit hall and supporting spaces complete the building. The genesis for the planning of the hall was a twofold purpose: a much-needed home to the half-dozen Scientology International Events broadcast to more than 100 countries, plus need of a venue for humanitarian and charity balls, symposiums and meetings by other nonprofit organizations in the Tampa Bay Area. People arriving at L. Ron Hubbard Hall will first be drawn to the entrance park, which will include pillars bearing the 21 precepts of The Way to Happiness , the moral code that Mr. Hubbard devised to create a happier world. The entire facade of the building will be glass. More striking, looking into the hall, event-goers or even downtown pedestrians will see “The Legacy Exhibit,” which will depict the many achievements of Mr. Hubbard. Yes, all those elements are in the building’s DNA. So, what could be more exciting than the details of an edifice? It’s what L. Ron Hubbard Hall will mean to Clearwater, Florida, the spiritual capital of the Church of Scientology. The Hall will be an economic dynamo that will bring an estimated 200,000-plus people through its doors each year. L. Ron Hubbard Hall and its companion park will be many things: the gateway to Clearwater’s downtown, located adjacent to Fort Harrison Avenue and the major east-west thoroughfare through the city to the beach, Court Street. It will be a 21st-century exercise in development and event technology. Aside from the $100 million in construction costs that goes directly into the local economy for local contractors and tradesmen, once open, the venue will host hundreds of events every year—for both Scientologists and for other nonprofits and charities. The hall will be an economic dynamo that will bring an estimated 200,000-plus people through its doors each year; many of those people, Scientologists from around the world, will elect to stay for weeks and months at their spiritual home. And if the annual visiting Scientologists already contribute $1.8 million in bed tax alone to Clearwater, we are looking at a marked increase of just that tax with the completion of the hall. The spirit of Scientology is to make a great civilization in which all people have a stake and where they all can flourish. That mission is encoded in the purpose behind L. Ron Hubbard Hall. The hall will coalesce the energy of thousands of Scientologists and non-Scientologists at both large events and smaller gatherings. That energy will spread out to the community, launching humanitarian campaigns, building a great community and ultimately a great world. And looking to the future, working with all concerned residents to build upon the city, the Church echoes the words of the man whose name graces the hall: “The day when you stop building your own environment, when you stop building your own surroundings, when you stop waving a magic hand and gracing everything around you with magic and beauty, things cease to be magical, things cease to be beautiful.” DETAILED PLANNING The main auditorium can seat 3,600, and with convertible seating, can transform into a banquet hall that will seat 1,500 for formal meals, conferences and charity balls. ← prev Greg Nelson next → The Big Picture RELATED ARTICLES Cover Story I Am a Citizen of Clearwater.

The hotel was constructed in 1926 by Clearwater real estate developer Ed Haley and soon became a favorite of those visiting the city, including the Philadelphia Phillies, who lived in the hotel during spring training, and the Rolling Stones, who are rumored to have written ’Satisfaction’ there on their first U.S. tour. A highlight of the tour is the tenth floor Crystal Ballroom. Included in the original 1926 plans at the urging of the original architect, the ballroom provides guests with an expansive view of the bay. The Fort Harrison rooftop restaurant was open to locals and hotel guests during the 20’s and 30’s for nightly dinner dances with performances by the Fort Harrison Band. Today, the ballroom is home to a host of charitable events, including monthly Swing Dances for Charity and the Tampa Bay Charity Coalition bimonthly luncheons. In 1975, the Church of Scientology purchased the Fort Harrison as part of its Clearwater-based international spiritual headquarters. Every year, thousands of Scientologists from all over the world visit Clearwater for advanced religious services. The Church also hosts hundreds of community and nonprofit events at the Fort Harrison. The next tour is scheduled for March 17 at 1:30 p.m. To attend, or for more information about community events held at the Fort Harrison, contact Amber Skjelset, Scientology Information Center Manager, at (727) 467-6966 or email amber@cos.flag.org . The Fort Harrison Religious Retreat: Since its construction in 1927, the Fort Harrison has been the home for many community events and charitable organizations. The Fort Harrison's current owner, the Church of Scientology, has hosted over 500 community events there since a top-to-bottom restoration in 2009. The Scientology religion was founded by humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard, and incorporated in 1954. To learn more, visit www.scientology.org .

Neighbor News The Church of Scientology Announces Fort Harrison Tour of 2019 Locals Gain Insight on Scientology and Clearwater History at the first Historic Fort Harrison Tour of 2019 Amber Skjelset , Neighbor Posted Wed, Jan  16, 2019 at 4:03 pm ET On Saturday, January 25th the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization will host its first Historic Fort Harrison tour for 2019. The building is the Church of Scientology’s religious retreat. During the tour guests will learn about the property’s history, get their questions about the religion answered and will learn about the community activities the Church hosts throughout the year at this historic property. Laurie MacAdams, a Clearwater resident since 1977 has visited the Fort Harrison since the late 90’s, “I’ve toured the Fort Harrison about 5 times. Every time I visit I always learn something new. I love learning!” During the tour guests will see the grand Fort Harrison lobby with its gold leafed moldings, wrought iron balustrades, black and white checkered marbled floor and other historic details of the 92-year-old building.

Learning the building’s history and the role it played in this city gives them a sense a pride and happiness that they could connect with it through these historic tours.” To attend this event, or for more information about the Church of Scientology and community events held at the Fort Harrison, please contact Amber Skjelset, Manager of the Scientology Information Center at (727) 467-6966 or email amber@cos.flag.org .

Ron Hubbard photo exhibit in the 10th story Crystal Ballroom, visitors come to see the building and get their questions answered. Many long-time residents come to see how the Fort Harrison has fared after all these years and are uniformly delighted with what they find. The questions came thick and fast every day for weeks, as residents toured through the landmark Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, owned by the Church of Scientology as an international religious retreat since 1975. “What is Scientology?” “Can you hold the open house every week? Can I bring my family or friends?” “When is your new building going to be done?” Everyone seemed to have a different reason for wanting to visit. Many wanted to see for themselves the event, meeting and restaurant facilities within the Fort Harrison now open for use by the general public. Long-time residents wanted to relive happy memories of growing up in Clearwater: a high-school cotillion in the Crystal Ballroom, that Christmas dinner in the Hibiscus Room or lazy summer Sundays spent relaxing in the sun at poolside. Snowbirds were drawn by curiosity about the historical architectural restorations of the past 25 years. But for many who stepped onto the marbled floor of the lobby for the first time, they had simply “always wanted to know what was inside.” What they found were top-notch and well-maintained restorations of decor and furnishings throughout the building—which the Church accomplished in large measure by undoing changes of preceding owners, as many architectural details had been hidden by efforts to “modernize” the landmark. Wrought iron work and brass railings throughout the lobby, first floor and mezzanine were fully restored, while the marble floor was entirely replaced due to age, and new lighting fixtures and furnishings were added to recreate the original atmosphere of elegance. “Events of All Kinds” Leading off from the lobby, visitors saw the additions made to the Fort Harrison since it first opened in 1926, including a rear wing housing the 1,500-seat Grand Auditorium and “the Cabanas”—85 guest rooms now renovated in a West Indies theme nestled in tropical greenery at the back of the hotel. Both annexations were made during the 1950s when the Jack Tar Corporation, then the Fort Harrison’s owner, undertook an extensive modernization of the hotel. The Grand Auditorium has a rich history all of its own, having hosted such jazz greats as Woody Herman, Harry James, Stan Kenton, Count Basie and Duke Ellington. These concerts were the forerunners of Clearwater’s now nationally famous annual Jazz Holiday. Tour guides explained that the auditorium remains a focal point for a variety of events, celebrations and functions, large and small. Special weekly events for members of the Church of Scientology are held in the expansive facility, which is also available to the community for weddings, banquets, conventions and local charity functions. Among the most well known annual events held in the Fort Harrison Auditorium is the annual Foster Children’s Christmas Party, sponsored by the Church in coordination with the Department of Children and Family Services. The hotel tour also took in the fine restaurants, the Hibiscus and the Lemon Tree. The Hibiscus is open to the general public for Sunday brunches and dinners by reservation. The health conscious were naturally interested in the perfect complement to the dining facilities: the hotel’s full service fitness center, including a gamut of professional exercise equipment, and saunas. The tour also took visitors to the top floors, including the Crystal Ballroom—once known as the “Rooftop Restaurant”—and 10th floor terrace with its views of the Gulf and downtown Clearwater. As Jenny Ramsauer, Director of Conventions and Events for the Fort Harrison told visitors, “the ballroom today hosts weddings, receptions, anniversary parties, orchestra recitals, poetry readings, Boy Scout and Girl Scout troop meetings, dances and other events of all kinds.” Religious Retreat Visitors learned that the Fort Harrison is more than just a well-restored, historic hotel, but it has been an international religious retreat for members of the Church of Scientology for more than 26 years. Their tour guides explained how the central practices of the Scientology religion are ministerial training and auditing (from the Latin word “audire” meaning “to listen”), a unique form of personal counseling which enables an individual to increase his awareness and understanding of his spiritual nature. Auditing is delivered by an auditor, a minister highly trained in exact methods of this counseling unique to Scientology. Church members—Scientologists—generally also train to become auditors themselves. In doing so, they gain a thorough understanding of the Scientology religious philosophy and basic principles, and learn to help others on a one-on-one basis with an actual spiritual technology that has a broad and practical application to all aspects of life. One of the fundamental principles of the Scientology religion is that an individual can improve his condition by discovering his own answers to life’s problems. What is addressed in auditing is his ability to make those discoveries; as a result a person can then isolate factors that are hindering his survival and happiness, and handle whatever might be holding him back. While auditing and training services are available at churches of Scientology around the world, the Fort Harrison, as the international spiritual headquarters for the religion, plays a unique and vital role.  It provides advanced and special church services available nowhere else, and thus ministers to the hundreds of parishioners who arrive daily from around the world—from as far away as Tokyo, Moscow, Johannesburg or Sydney, Australia. As part of their tour of the Fort Harrison, many took the opportunity to see how the electropsychometer—or “E-Meter”, a counselling aid used by Scientology ministers—works. “See a Thought” One feature of the tour visitors found particularly fascinating was the demonstration of the electropsychometer, or “E-Meter”, a ministerial tool used by auditors in personal counseling to locate areas of distress or travail. The E-Meter device is a highly sensitive electronic instrument that measures the spiritual state or change of state of a person. When the E-Meter is operating and a person holds the meter’s electrodes, a tiny flow of electrical energy (less than a flashlight battery) passes through the person’s body and back into the meter. He feels nothing, but changes in what the person is thinking in response to the auditor’s questioning can then be detected in needle reactions on the meter’s dial. These guide the auditor toward areas of upset and help him determine what to address. Visitors were given a special demonstration of the E-Meter and how it works, that enabled them to “see a thought.” The general response was, “This really works!” Weekly Fort Harrison Open House ........................... “The open house gave us an opportunity to invite our neighbors in, get to know them, show them how beautiful the Fort Harrison still is and answer their questions about Scientology.” –  Pat Harney, Church of Scientology ........................... These were but a few of the experiences the thousands of area residents enjoyed on their visit to the Fort Harrison open house. Many were also particularly attracted to the special photographic exhibit on the life of Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard , housed on the 10th floor in the Crystal Ballroom. ( See also “Images of a Lifetime” . ) “The open house gave us an opportunity to invite our neighbors in, get to know them, show them how beautiful the Fort Harrison still is and answer their questions about Scientology,” said Pat Harney, the Church’s Public Affairs Director. A commonly heard comment of guests was, “I had no idea this was all happening in this building.” Tours were often capped with a lunch or dinner at the Hibiscus Restaurant, which quickly became a popular destination for guests of the open house. The food is prepared by an international cadre of chefs, and the restaurant is overseen by the maitre d’ who once served the celebrity patrons of the world-famous Chasen’s Restaurant in the heart of Hollywood. Comments were uniformly rave. “Our waiter was marvelous,” said one guest. “The meal was superb.” “I am not used to royalty type service like that,” said another. Due to the popularity of the open houses, they will carry on weekly. The Hibiscus restaurant will continue to be open to the public for Sunday Brunch and dinner and regular tours will be held of the hotel and the “Images of a Lifetime” photo exhibit.
