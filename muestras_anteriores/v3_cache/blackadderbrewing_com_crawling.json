Taps include ciders, wines, and natural sodas. Brewing beer has been a part of the lives of Chris and Sissy Hart for more than a decade. Prior to opening the brewery, Chris managed the local homebrew supply shop. He is a BJCP judge. Both Chris & Sissy are active members of Gainesville’s local homebrew club. Collectively, they have earned over 30 medals in homebrew competitions throughout Florida and the US. In 2019, they won their first professional gold medal at the Best Florida Beer Competition. Their love of creating craft beer and sharing it with others led to the founding of Blackadder Brewing. They look forward to sharing their award winning beers with the Gainesville community. Cheers!
