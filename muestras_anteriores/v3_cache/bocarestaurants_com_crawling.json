Connecting people, supporting people, and combining our skills to solve problems together is what this business is all about. IAN GOLDBERG chief operating officer ian@bokagrp.com Ian Goldberg has worked in the restaurant industry since he was 15 years old and was the first employee ever hired by Boka Restaurant Group. Born in Chicago, Goldberg graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelorâs degree in Business Administration and a focus in Entrepreneurship. When he joined BRG as a bartender at Boka in 2003, Goldberg made it his mission to learn everything he could about the hospitality business. Paired with his passion for food, wine, and service, Goldbergâs tenacity, ability to listen and reflect, and commitment to problem-solving made him a critical member of the quickly expanding group. Over the next eight years, Goldberg rose from Bartender to Assistant General Manager, to General Manager, to Director of Operations, and then to Vice President in 2011. In 2019, he was named Chief Operating Officer. Throughout his tenure with BRG, Goldberg worked to transform the group into an ecosystem that thrives because it is rooted in the work ethic, passion, and genuine hospitality that continue to fuel his own career. â Hospitality is one of the few industries that brings people together from all different walks of life. There's something really magical about working for a place that creates experiences that bring others love and joy. ABBY KRITZLER CHIEF CULTURE OFFICER executive director abby@bokagrp.com Since the beginning of her career, Abby Kritzler has dedicated herself to making a difference in the lives of others through collaboration and empowerment. While studying Sociology, Community Advocacy, and Social Policy in college, Kritzler balanced volunteer work with a restaurant job, aiming to continue her career in nonprofit and advocacy. When she began working at Landmark Grill & Lounge as a Server Assistant in 2007, she only intended to stay a few months, but Kritzler soon fell in love with the way hospitality impacts people of diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skill sets. In 2011, Kritzler requested a meeting with Boka Restaurant Group Co-Founders, Rob Katz and Kevin Boehm, to discuss ideas for the company (the original notes from the meeting still sit on Kritzlerâs desk today). Afterward, Katz and Boehm offered Kritzler a position as their Executive Assistant. Within months she was promoted to Executive Director of Boka Restaurant Group. Today, as Chief Culture Officer, Kritzler strives every day to find new ways to bring joy to BRG team members, guests, and clients, and continues to build the infrastructure that makes BRG a group that gives back. When I see people in our company grow and flourish, it's exciting and inspiring. Helping to create a space where someone else can learn, grow, and be empowered to forge their own path gives me an enormous sense of fulfillment. JAMI MADONIA CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER jami@bokagrp.com â With a background in accounting, design, and business, Jami Madoniaâs distinct blend of analytical and creative thinking has made her a key strategic voice within Boka Restaurant Group. After graduating from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in Advertising and Design, Madonia began working as a hostess for The N9NE Group in Chicago, before pursuing a career in advertising. Madonia soon discovered that what she loved about designâthinking about how people engage with an experience and problem solving to improve that experienceâwas the foundation of hospitality as well. She stayed with The N9NE Group, rising to become its Regional Controller. When the company closed and Madonia started her own financial consulting firm, Boka Restaurant Group became one of her first clients. In 2015, she joined BRG as Controller to develop and oversee the accounting team. Since then, Madonia has built the financial backbone of the company, while cultivating a culture of team-building, mentorship, and empowerment. Today, as Chief Financial Officer, Madonia continues to give BRG the structure to raise the bar for the hospitality industry. When sheâs not in the office, Madonia can be found spending time with her two children, Alexandra and Weston.

Photo by: Abigail Waters Boca Winter Park Under New Ownership By Abbie DeLozier | August 5, 2021 As the new owners of Boca, Artistry Restaurants plans to revive the brand for Boca’s Winter Park location, according to Scott Joseph, publisher of Scott Joseph’s Orlando Restaurant Guide and longtime restaurant reviewer. Photo by: Abigail Waters Share This: Boca Winter Park , a staple of the Park Avenue dining scene, has a new owner. Artistry Restaurants SB, LLC , recently became the owner of the restaurant, which has been owned by BE-1 since its opening. Located at 358 N. Park Ave., Boca has offered locally sourced American food, charcuterie, and craft cocktails on Park Avenue for nearly seven years. According to Scott Joseph, publisher of Scott Joseph’s Orlando Restaurant Guide and longtime restaurant reviewer, the sale of Boca Winter Park also included Boca’s sister concept, Atlantic Beer & Oyster Bar . “When I heard about the sale of Boca the thing that surprised me the most was how little I’ve thought about the restaurant over the past several years,” Joseph said. “When I’m asked about restaurants on Park Avenue, Boca never comes to mind.” Prior to the current Boca Winter Park restaurant, which opened in 2014, the corner Park Avenue space was owned and operated by Winter Park Grill, the concept Joseph first reviewed for the Orlando Sentinel in 1988. Since then, the space has housed other tenants such as Zak’s on Park Avenue, Chapters on Park, East of Paris, Circa 1926, Galopin, and Matilda’s on Park. “One of the best things the previous owners did was make the bar a central focus of the space. I would guess it’s the bar business that has sustained it over the years,” Joseph said. “There’s nothing wrong about a strong cocktail menu, but I’d like to see the kitchen step up and make Boca a dining destination.” Artistry Restaurants started representing restaurants in Winter Park in 2020 and operates the Burger U at UCF and Boca’s original Sarasota location. As the new owners of Boca, Artistry Restaurants plans to revive the brand for Boca’s Winter Park location. Darren Brach, area manager for Boca, told Joseph that the restaurant aims to better identify what it is, and they are working to “hone the concept.” “The name Boca doesn’t tell patrons what to expect (and frankly is an odd name for a Winter Park restaurant),” Joseph said. “The new owners should focus on what the theme of the restaurant should be – farm-to-table? Seafood? Florida fresh? – and communicate that to the guests.” To benefit both Boca and Winter Park’s foodie community, Joseph believes its “new owners could elevate the quality and consistency of food and service.” Scott Joseph has proven to be a significant asset to the community during his 34-year tenure of reviewing restaurants in and around Central Florida. While writing for the Orlando Sentinel, Joseph wrote two spotlight columns: Chow Hound, which featured casual dining concepts and news about the local dining scene and national trends, and Table Matters, in which he reviewed fine-dining restaurants.
