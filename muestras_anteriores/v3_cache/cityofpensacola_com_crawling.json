Williams Park Tuesday, April 8 PUBLIC INFORMATION: April 3, 2025 MEDIA CONTACT: Travis Peterson 850-501-5262 travis@impactcampaigns.com City of Pensacola to Unveil Vision Plan for Hollice T. Williams Park Next Week Community Meeting: Tuesday, April 8 from 6-7:30 p.m. at the Cobb Community Center Following months of research and planning, thousands of data points collected, and dozens of stakeholder and community meetings, the design team tasked with reimagining Hollice T. Williams Park and Long Hollow Stormwater Pond will present their proposed Vision Plan for the 60-acre park on Tuesday, April 8, at 6 p.m. at the Cobb Community Center. Residents of the Eastside and Long Hollow neighborhoods, former residents of the area, and other community members are invited to attend the presentation, review the Vision Plan — featuring a 15-foot, 3-dimensional model of the plan — and share their feedback on its ideas. The Vision Plan marks a significant milestone in the design process. It lays out the basic framework for the park's design, including pathways and areas for gathering, recreation, and relaxation. With more community input, the Vision Plan will be updated to include more specific design elements such as landscaping, programming, playgrounds, or sports areas. The park design team has worked with community groups, park users, area neighborhoods, state and federal agency stakeholders, and former residents to ensure the community’s input is accurately reflected in the park design and expansion plans. Led by Pensacola native Katie Fox of Geosyntec Consultants , the team also includes renowned park designers Michael Van Valkenbergh Associates , and Pensacola-based landscape architects Jerry Pate Design . “The Vision Plan lays the foundation for the future development of the entire Hollice T. Williams Park and Long Hollow Pond,” said Fox. “We want to connect these two unique spaces to each other and the surrounding neighborhoods in a way that addresses stormwater concerns and creates a unique and safe space for neighbors and residents to gather, play, and relax — while also commemorating the vibrant neighborhood that used to exist here,” she said. The park, located under the I-110 overpass, was once home to hundreds of African-American families, churches, and businesses. In order to construct the towering highway, the entire neighborhood was displaced, disrupting generations of history, culture, and economic advancement. Since 2004, improving the park has been discussed through numerous long-range neighborhood plans, but only recently has the city acquired funding to begin the development of the park — thanks to several grants secured to address stormwater, water quality, walkability, and public safety issues in the area. A 2021 park design was created but was later shelved after Pensacola Mayor D.C. Reeves received feedback from Harvard University’s Mayors Institute for City Design that the plan lacked enough community feedback and connectivity. The city then hired a new consultant group to solicit greater community input in their process, and the Vision Plan is the initial result of that effort. Further design work will continue throughout the year as the park design team translates the Vision Plan elements into engineering and construction drawings for the first phases of the park construction. For those who cannot attend the Tuesday night presentation, the design team and the Vision Plan model will also host an Open House on Wednesday, April 9, from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. at the Cobb Center gymnasium.

Hitzman Optimist is the park for you. More commonly referred to by locals as “Hitzman” or “Optimist Park”, Hitzman-Optimist Park located at 3221 Langley Ave in Pensacola, Florida 32504. Optimist Park received an extensive makeover in 2019 and is now one of our favorite parks in Pensacola.  The new inclusive design was created for people of all ages and abilities with rubber flooring on the playground and no sand to worry about (mom’s love this!).  The playground is large with several pieces of equipment to accommodate kids of all ages. Families can enjoy the shaded benches located throughout the park, a covered pavilion for picnics or birthday parties and a fenced in area for your dogs to roam and there’s plenty of parking. Aside from the children’s playground, you’ll also find a variety of entertainment including: Nine-disc golf course Soccer fields Baseball and softball fields Paved walking trail Small and large dog park You’ll often find events hosted as Optimistic Park, from birthday parties and food truck festivals to Christmas tree sales to fund youth programs.  For information about events that may be going on at the park, check out their Facebook page or our local news outlets.
