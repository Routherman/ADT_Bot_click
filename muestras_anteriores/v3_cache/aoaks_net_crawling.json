Read as the aspiring Discord community shares their tips on Community building, management, moderation, and so much more! How to Structure your Staff Team It is strange how we operate on the same platform without knowing a thing about each other’s staff structure Roonie 3 min read · Apr 15, 2022 -- Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Thumbnail: jsph#9999 Moderation is necessary for every Discord server. I personally run a 11k Discord server and I have never seen the staff channels of my friends Discord servers and they haven’t seen mine. But who knows what goes under the hood? How do we form a system so perfect and efficient? We just have to wait long enough to figure it out ourselves. This trial and error method feels kind of a waste of time doesn’t it? How many Moderators do I need? You may have asked yourself this question previously. What’s the answer? It depends on your server activity level. “Doesn’t member count matter?” My old 100 member server can overtake my new 11,000 server in terms of activity any day. Funny enough, we didn’t even need moderators back then. Because we weren’t a community server. Just a few no life friends talking day and night. That is why server theme matters more than member count. The amount of members on your server, one way or the other, relates to your activity. 3️⃣ Start with three. I think three is a good place to start. Always remember, just because they’re active in chat doesn’t mean they are good moderators. Demoting someone is more work and trauma. Hire smartly instead. For the first batch, consider getting some of your discord-experienced friends As your activity starts to grow, and when you get outnumbered, or chat is active in the uncovered part of the time zones, that is when it’s time to get new staff members. Roles Structure Here’s my staff team role structure: Admin Moderator Trial Mod Management Pretty basic right? It does the job. “Management” is the base staff role for all moderatos as a part of them being in the team. Have an administrator for around every 5 moderators. Unless you chose to have Senior Moderators. Staff Channels Structure: A private #staff-chat and #staff-commands is necessary. What’s also worth implementing is a #staff-guide handbook so new moderators know exactly how moderation works in your server. Mention in there what violations cause what type of punishment. A private #staff-news channel doesn’t sound like a bummer. You can use it to update moderators on various announcements only staff needs to know. You can also have a #staff-suggestions to let you staff members suggest different things to be implemented into the server. Proof of Violation: A channel for moderators to post the mod action they made against a user. They shall also mention why they punished the user along with a screenshot. Discord themselves recommend keeping track of mod cases manually. If you are a server owner, feel free to ask for suggestions or feedback on Netcord’s Official Discord server! We’d love to help you out. I was alone when setting mine up, you don’t have to! Thank you for reading — see you tomorrow!

When youâre discovering someone (or something, like a retirement community), you naturally want to know more about them. Like what makes them special. What they believe in. What makes them a leader. Royal Oaks first opened in 1983. That fulfilled the vision of founders Dr. J. Davis Illingworth and Roe Walker who desired a different kind of destination for seniors. One that offers highly purposeful and engaged living. That fosters an elevated sense of community, where residents quickly become lifelong friends. This realized vision continues to grow through an expanding campus that is continually distinguished by its amenities, living and support services, and legacy of leadership. A record of financial strength that translates to better living for â you. There is a reason for this point of differentiation. We are a non-profit. That means we operate with the sole purpose of providing distinctive living to seniors. That status is made even stronger through our People of Faith Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity that has been operating and growing for over 35 years. Our non-profit status and our foundation allow us to beautify the campus, provide additional services, along with providing financial assistance to our residents. The careful stewardship of our expanding financial resources continues to enable us to grow from a position of confidence and certainty. The financial management and stability we are known for not only is a comfort to our residents, but enables our leadership team to shape an exceptional future â for Royal Oaks and for you.
