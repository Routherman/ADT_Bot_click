      "text": "About Us MobileHomeParkConsultants.com ABOUT US ABOUT US: Above, Mobile Home Park Consultants at the recent REI (Real Estate Investment) Expo in Anaheim CA. We had a booth there, and we conducted a one-hour seminar on the subject of Making Money with Mobile Home Parks. ABOUT US - WHAT WE DO CCI Investments, LLC is the parent company of Mobile Home Park Consultants. We are a nationwide consulting firm specializing in Mobile Home Parks. Finding the right park for their clients, conducting the due diligence, and coming up with a plan for the operation, and sometimes turn-around of the park, is just where the job starts for MHP Consultants. After the purchase, we provide training for the onsite staff, establish procedures and ongoing operations, set up a cohesive bookkeeping system, and work to reduce operating expenses at every turn. But again, this is just the beginning of the story. ABOUT US - SPECIALIZING IN ‘TURN-AROUNDS’ Because many of the Mobile Home Parks that we work on are indeed “turn-around projects”, and these need to be handled just right, by a steady hand, and one with experience. MHP Consultants sets up a complete program for the park’s turn-around, and oversees every aspect of it, from fixing up existing units in the park, to buying new ones, or sometimes inexpensive used ones (every case is different, of course), to fill up the park (try adding units to an apartment building), raising the rents, improving the image of the parks and more. For more info call (209) 996-4075 or EMAIL US . ABOUT US - WE NEVER GET IN FRONT OF A CLIENT Having had our hands in well over 100 Mobile Home Parks over the years, we’ve seen it all and done it all, for ourselves and our clients. Because we principals at Mobile Home Park Consultants also own Mobile Home Parks ourselves. But MHP Consultants' founder, Robert Merchant, hastens to mention that “we never get in front of a client”. In this business, it’s a very common practice for agents to keep all the best deals for themselves, and only show their clients the leftovers. At MHP Consultants, the client comes first. Our full stable of clients get first shot at every park that comes across our desks (that fits the clients’ criteria, of course). Then, if no one else wants it, one of us might pick it up for our own portfolio. “So, now we’re the ones who get the left overs. Our clients get all the good stuff,” says Merchant jokingly. But it's true. ABOUT US - WHY MOBILE HOME PARKS? But why Mobile Home Parks? Because through the highs and lows of these last few years, they’ve remained relatively stable, having held their values pretty well in the crash and offering some of the highest returns available, compared to any other type of investment real estate, or any other type of investment in general, for that matter. Mobile Home Parks are proven cash flow machines. They cost less to operate, they have lower turnover, they cost less to maintain and insure, and they’re easier to manage that most other types of real estate that would produce similar net incomes. The real ‘trick’ to Mobile Home Parks is that their market value is based more upon their Net Operating Income that on any other type of real estate. Because there are so few improvements when compared to apartment buildings, shopping centers, etc., (some Mobile Home Parks are little more than just land with some underground utilities, and a bunch of mobile homes sitting on top), the buyer isn’t paying for expensive buildings as part of the purchase. With so much of the value weighted on how much the park makes, it’s easier to affect the value. In other words, increase the net income, and you increase the value. And there are more ways of doing that with Mobile Home Parks than with just about any other type of investment also. Maximizing that Net Income, and thus the property’s value is a big part of the Mobile Home Park Consultants' job. For more info call (209) 996-4075 or EMAIL US . ABOUT US - INVESTORS TURN TO MOBILE HOME PARKS Lately, MHP Consultants has been seeing an increasing number of investors selling out of apartments, commercial, retail, and residential, and putting all their money into Mobile Home Parks. And many investors who already own Mobile Home Parks, along with other types of investments, often liquidate their low-performance assets, but keep their Mobile Home Parks, because their parks are the one investment class that throws off the best cash flow. Combined, these factors have had a mixed impact on the market, because it is starting to create a shortage in the supply of good parks. ABOUT US - ONLY THE RIGHT MOBILE HOME PARK WILL DO Mobile Home Parks have more positive attributes than can be elaborated upon here. And savvy investors have started figuring this out. Where 5 years ago, some investors looked down their noses at Mobile Home Parks, today they’re flocking to them. Of course, not just any Mobile Home Park will do. Like any other type of investment, buying the right property is of paramount importance. But then, finding the right park is where the service starts with the Mobile Home Park Consultants. ABOUT US - IT'S ALL ABOUT THE OPERATIONS Make no mistake about it, as important as it is to start with the right Mobile Home Park, it is perhaps even more important to have a good Operational Plan. In other words, one can buy the finest MHP on the market, but run it poorly and it won't do very well. Conversely, one could start with a 'marginal' park, but run it extremely well, and it will make good money. MHP Consultants specializes in drafting and implementing MHP Operational Plans that work. But we don't just write the plan, we work the plan, so that you don't have to. We oversee every aspect of the operation of your MHP, with the goal of maximizing its Cash Flow, and with it, its Value. If you have questions about your MHP or you're thinking of buying or selling a MHP, call CCI Investments, LLC THE MOBILE HOME PARK CONSULTANTS at (209) 996-4075 or EMAIL US . NATIONWIDE MOBILE HOME PARK CONSULTANTS As professional Mobile Home Park Consultants, what we do for you is help you locate a suitable property, conduct the due diligence, create a plan for the operation and/or turn-around of the park, the implement the plan. Our professional consulting services go beyond simple property management. We hire, train and supervise the onsite Manager and other staff, we oversee the collection and deposit of rents, we pay the bills, keep the books, problem-solve, evict problem-tenants as needed, fill vacancies, and much, much more. On turn-around projects, our services include overseeing all repairs, improvements, purchases of new homes, etc. The bottom line for the investor is this: with excellent professional consultants overseeing all aspects of your park’s operation and management, it is possible to maximize your returns and avoid headaches and costly mistakes. And on the subject of costly mistakes, we often receive calls from MHP owners who are having problems with a park they already own. They retain us to turn those parks around, get them in shape, and often ready to sell. So we have a rich source of Mobile Home Parks to show our clients that have good records (we keep the books), a manager that we know and trust (we probably trained him), without the hidden problems that come with buying an unknown property. These parks are not on the market. But in many cases the sellers will sell them. Call us today at (209) 996-4075 or EMAIL US , to get more info on some of the parks we’re doing right now. We also offer our clients a ‘mentoring program’, where we will teach the park owner just what we do so that they can do it for themselves someday, if they so choose. Most don’t, because it makes more sense to have us do it for them. Call us to get all the facts on our mentoring program, and all our MHP Consulting Services.

Family operated. â since 1976 About us Rooted in Decades of Relationship, Trust, and Community We believe everyone deserves a nice place to call home. This core belief has guided our family and is evident upon touring the neighborhood. Our grandparents built the development in 1976 with the goals of community, equity, and pride of ownership.

About us A legacy of service Pat French has helped build a flourishing community at Independence Mobile Home Park for the past 30 years. After living in Chicago and working in the financial industry, Pat decided to return to his roots and commit his lifeâs work to carry on the legacy that his grandparents started. He has provided a home for hundreds of people in a mobile home community that is set apart from the rest. His care, passion, and values are what drive him to create an excellent place to live for his residents. One of his favorite parts of the job is the moment he gets to sit down with new residents and look over their lease; watching their excitement as he welcomes them into their new home. Outside of running the park community, Pat loves listening to good music, enjoys eating the great food of Kansas City, and traveling. Our Mission &Â Vision At Independence Mobile Home Park, we believe that every person deserves an inviting, beautiful, and affordable place to call home.

That said, flashback to 2015 when The Guardian reported that Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS) had “nearly” 140,000 homesites for their residents who owned either a pre-HUD Code mobile home (MH) or a post-HUD Code manufactured home (MH).  Needless to say, ELS has added sites since 2015, both by acquisition and by developing new manufactured home sites. But on the so-called “Mobile Home University” (MHU) ‘up to date’ information that follows, some 8 years later, they still used that outdated 140,000 homesites claim for ELS. Yet, their website indicates their information is ‘the most up to date available,’ which implies periodic updates. RHP Properties is another example shown on the following list by MHU. In an RHP press release on September 19, 2022 that states that they have 79,585 homesites in 30 states. But on their obviously not updated listing on MHU, which is also found on the MobileHomeParkSto re website, RHP’s rank and site count is still based on a claimed total of 57,800 MH homesites. MHU and the MobileHomeParkStore are associated with Frank Rolfe, Dave Reynolds and Brandon Reynolds.  Their data in this example that follows is not being updated. When asked about this issue via email, they declined comment. By contrast, MHPHOA, an apparently volunteer organization which says it is operated by manufactured home community residents for the benefit of other manufactured home community residents, has a listing of their own of the largest manufactured home community operators in the U.S. That MHPHOA list, shown below, apparently provides superior information that spot checks reveal are far more accurate/current than MHU’s or their MobileHomeParkStore sister site.  This report will provide the information from both of those sources and will compare, contrast, fact check, and provide related commentary and more information that could prove useful for an array of individuals and entities seeking information about so-called ‘mobile home parks’ (MHPs) and manufactured home communities (MHC). This first list that follows may well have updated their own site count, as ‘Frank and Dave’ associated MHP Funds in their list says they have 29,071 home sites. In 2015, according to left-leaning Wikipedia, “As of 2015, the partners were ranked as the 6th largest owner of mobile home parks in the United States. Operating as privately held MHP Funds, they own about 11,000 lots in over 160 mobile parks.” That may logically suggest a self-serving nature to this information, if they update their own data but not that of others. So, the first list that follows is provided with a clear disclaimer that the information is demonstrably NOT UP TO DATE. Is that false advertising? To answer that, one must recall their claim in an advertisement that “We have the most accurate and up-to-date information on the mobile home park industry.” Odd that someone in the manufactured home industry would use the phrase, “ mobile home park industry” instead of ‘manufactured home community ‘ profession. Part of the footer on their list says: “We have tried to be as accurate as possible, but we cannot attest to the validity of any of the information, as it is 100% reliant on others. We look at this list as a perpetual work in progress, to be amended and revised as necessary. For corrections email brandon@creuniversity.com.” Apparently, some of their claims are not so. Some graphic evidence for these remarks is linked here . Once someone reviews the data from “Frank and Dave” for-profit generated information (not that MHLivingNews is editorially against ethically earned profits) “most accurate and up-to-date information” to the second list by volunteer-driven nonprofit MHPHOA at https://mhphoa.com , the second one is clearly superior in several ways. So, first the claims about ranking and site-count according to Frank, Dave, and Brandon associated operations followed by information from the resident volunteers at MHPHOA. See for yourself which is more accurate and useful “ We Provide, You Decide .” © Notice: this fact check should NOT be construed as an endorsement of Frank, Dave, Brandon, MHU, the MobileHomeParkStore or any of their other enterprises. Third-party images or content are provided under fair use guidelines for media . Note 2: Do not depend on the accuracy of the information that follows from MobileHomeU and/ or the MobileHomeParkStore. The evidence suggests that any given data point may be years out of date.

As one more fact check on the above, the ‘Frank and Dave’ associated list claims that publicly-traded Manufactured Housing Properties Inc (MHPI) has 1134 total homesites. By according to that firm’s own site, “As of February 13, 2023” are the following insights. Current Portfolio Statistics: 55+ communities containing +2,500 home sites. Portfolio occupancy 90% Obviously, the list above is not being kept updated.  That said, let’s pivot to the apparently far more accurate information produced by MHPHOA. One of MHPHOA’s footer comments that follows their list below says: “ WEBSITE FOR RESIDENTS: The MHPHOA is NOT affiliated with any mobile home park owners and/or mobile home park management entities. We are both outspoken and anonymous mobile home residents, past and present, just like you, experiencing similar injustices, who want to help.” While they are focused on California, a significant amount of information on their site – such as this list below – is insightful beyond that one state. MHPHOA is short for “ Mobile Home Park Home Owners Allegiance .” While the odds are good that 4 out of 5 of their members live in a manufactured home instead of a mobile home, the organization is quite apparently providing more accurate and up-to-date information in what follows then those firms associated with Frank and Dave. While MHLivingNews has only spot checked information above and below, based on those spot checks, MHPHOA appears to be more accurate than the one from MHU et al. For possible updates to the following listings , go to the MHPHOA website on that linked page. Note that beyond apparently more accurate data, MHPHOA’s list has more information than MHU provided. For example, MHPHOA points out that EquityLifeStyleProperties.com and MyMHCommunity.com have interconnected corporate relationships (sister companies). Or that RHP.com and BayshoreHomeSales.com are both part of the same ‘vertically integrated’ family of brands.  Note that the while the data for ELS is closer than Frank and Dave’s, however, they have seemingly included the combined MH sites (the majority of their portfolio) with RV sites. That said, on this date ELS shows precisely that same total, per this online search, as MHPHOA does. Score one for the volunteers, and zero for MHU et al. Following their list, there will be additional information and an analysis in brief.

(MHPI), part of our spot-check of ‘Frank and Dave’s’ data is reflected in the listing above.  Once again, MHPHOA’s information appears to align with that of the source company. In those spot checks, score another for the accuracy of MHPHOA, still zero for ‘Frank, Dave,’ et al. Additional Information with More MHLivingNews Analysis and Commentary in Brief There may be some larger community operators that don’t deploy predatory practices. That said, as MHLivingNews has previously researched and pointed out, each of the companies that were spotlighted by HBO’s viral video errantly dubbed “Mobile Homes” on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver were all Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI) members. https://www.manufacturedhomelivingnews.com/hbos-john-oliver-on-last-week-tonight-mobile-homes-video-manufactured-home-communities-fact-check/ Our MHProNews sister site has pointed out the apparent hypocrisy in evidence in MHI’s so-called code of ethical conduct and the actual behavior of several of their larger brands. https://www.manufacturedhomepronews.com/masthead/rest-of-story-residents-media-complain-rhp-properties-on-evictions-discrimination-stiff-hikes-havenpark-communities-named-where-is-manufactured-housing-institutes-code/ The consolidators of the manufactured home community sector who engage in what numbers of their own residents’ often call “predatory tactics” seem to have no shame . Their aggressive tactics toward often vulnerable residents who prior to their making an acquisition may have been making timely payments for years can suddenly thrust someone toward eviction. As MHPHOA and other community resident advocate groups have noted, due to the high cost of moving a manufactured home, plus the limited to no practical alternatives in a given area to move to for those who might have the resources necessary, a kind of localized monopoly is created. Who says? Ironically, it is suggested by ‘Frank and Dave’ themselves (see quote graphics below). A Cautionary Tale for Those Shopping for a Manufactured Home Community A key reason to organize these two lists is to provide a resource for possible shoppers to utilize to know who to do business with and who not to do business with. While it would be too much to say that every MHI member is predatory, numbers are. They are routinely (but again, not always) those who are actively engaged in consolidation. Best advice? Check out the various reports for a given company that you are considering doing business with on both MHLivingNews and MHProNews. Use the search tool. Since management, information, and understanding change over time, look beyond a single report. An hour of research here and with other reliable sources can help prospective buyers in a manufactured home community headaches and heartaches. https://www.manufacturedhomelivingnews.com/making-the-case-why-mobile-home-univ-impact-communities-strive-communities-frank-rolfe-dave-reynolds-should-be-new-manufactured-housing-institute-leaders-the-view-on-predatory-deceptive/ To those considering entering the manufactured home industry, as an investor or otherwise, consider carefully who you want to associate or invest with.  For instance, if a company has a problematic reputation with their own client base, and often with their own employees, what level of discomfort and angst should the next person feel? If, for example, Brandon, ‘Frank and Dave’ can’t keep their own pages up to date, as they apparently suggest, what other information do they have that is unreliable? Books could be written on this topic of avoiding predatory land lease community operator’s vs. the benefits of selecting one of the thousands of ‘mom and pop’ businesses that routinely work very well with their typically happy residents. But the last bigger point for now is this. Why is it that MHPHOA keeps their names anonymous? It is apparently to protect their members from possible retaliation by the management of the properties they live at. MHLivingNews/MHProNews have said for some years that the Hobbs Act is one of several possible laws that ought to be explored by legal advocates on behalf of manufactured home community residents who are working to protect each other. Quoting their home page once more for emphasis: “WEBSITE FOR RESIDENTS: The MHPHOA is NOT affiliated with any mobile home park owners and/or mobile home park management entities. We are both outspoken and anonymous mobile home residents, past and present, just like you, experiencing similar injustices, who want to help.”  Our publication editorially tips the hat to those who authentically seek to benefit manufactured homeowners and shoppers. The flip side to that is that we seek to expose those who sabotage or otherwise prey on the trusting, vulnerable, and who in some instances ought to be investigated, charged, and hopefully sent to prison for a long, long, time. ## Notice: the graphic below can be expanded to a larger size.

There is little doubt that some new legislation that is properly written could prove useful to current and prospective manufactured homeowners.  That said, as another rule of thumb, it is surprising how often rigorously enforcing existing laws could provide more rapid relief to residents and others who are disadvantaged by a system that appears to be rigged in the favor of consolidators.  One of the most important ‘asks’ that MH residents should have for any public official is to press state and federal officials to vigorously enforce existing laws. https://www.manufacturedhomepronews.com/has-the-manufactured-housing-industry-become-a-target-rich-environment-for-plaintiffs-attorneys-facts-news-plus-sunday-weekly-manufactured-home-industry-mhville-headlines-recap/ Postscript: Some of the reports that feature information about Frank, Dave, and other so-called “predatory” tactics and business practices by manufactured home community operators.  Shoppers, as a rule of thumb, look for independently owned businesses as opposed to larger corporations that are busily consolidating others.
