Through the Adopt-a-Trail program, the company adopted one of the more difficult stretches of trail to maintain due to its location along Highway 207. However, that doesn’t stop this crew from heading out once a month to clean up along the sides of the trail and make the area more pleasant to use. Andrea says she chose this section of trail because it is the first area of Putnam County that cyclists see as they travel down the trail and that first impressions are important. The Adopt-a-Trail program, managed by Keep Putnam Beautiful, allows groups to adopt two-mile sections of the Palatka-to-St. Augustine State Trail in Putnam County to maintain a minimum of once a month.
