The area surrounding Hog Waller is an old logging community named Rodman that was booming in the early 1900's. Many thousands of acres of forest land were harvested and many farms surrounded the community. The main source of food for these families was the over abundance of wild hogs, not to mention a major nuisance to the loggers who worked the woods. The lore of a monstrous hog who tormented the farmers and loggers in the community grew over time, and many wild tells were spun about how this hog became the hunter and not the hunted.  As time moved on, the community did too, and all that is left are a few building foundations, the stories of days gone by, and the mystery of this hog who made his home in those woods. On a cold, quiet night, many people say they have heard a strange sound of a hog off in the distance, and many say, the beast is still alive. Hog Waller Today Today, Hog Waller is a 1100 acre outdoor family fun park. Hog Waller is owned by a local Putnam County family, and is open year around! Each month you can find many people riding through the woods on ATVs and UTVs or braving the huge mud pit with specially built trucks and cars. Hog Waller has bathing facilities, restrooms, and vendors who provide food, clothing, snacks, and even supplies for your vehicle or ATV. We invite you out for a weekend of fun, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us for more information. Have a great day, and watch out for the Hog! The Future of Hog Waller The future looks bright for Hog Waller- more family friendly amenities and events like all over WIFI for the kid’s tablets, a pool, campfire nights, live music, food trucks and more! We do this all for you and we can’t wait to have y’all along for the ride! FUN FACTS Hog Waller sits on 1100 acres! The property is 2.5 miles long and ranges between 1 mile and half a mile wide. A lot of the main roads in the park are over 100 years old and are either old railroad beds from the Ocklawaha Valley Railroad or support roads from timber operations of the old Rodman Sawmill from the early 1900's. The park has been open since July of 2007 and originally consisted of only of 100 acres. In the early 2000's GNCC Motocross Events hosted 2 major races on the property. At last known GPS mapping, there are well over 50 miles of ATV trails, natural and man made. Hog Waller has only one main mud pit. It is over 6 acres in size, is 10 feet below ground level, and has a safety fence along with 2 thick gauge safety cables around the whole pit area. Hog Waller maintains Putnam County Sheriff Deputies as park security and also has a paramedic and volunteer fire fighters on site for each mud bog event. Hog Waller is still apart of an active Timber and Cattle Plantation and from time to time is used in support of that operation.

Anyone can camp in any setup they have, be it a car, sleeping bag, tent, camper, or full size bus RV's. The only thing we ask is that you set up your camp site away from the edge of the mud pit, at least 25 feet away from main roads, in a secure area, and make sure your camp site is clearly visible to others. No one is allowed to camp along the mud pit fence line. You can bring a generator and run it all weekend if needed.

No. To be fair to everyone, there will be no early rope offs. It is a first come, however, you can set up a tent canopy, park a trailer, or a vehicle, in a spot straight in to the fence line to save a spot. This is first serve set up so you need to come early on Thursday or Friday, especially for large event weekends. Where is the nearest auto parts store?

Legend Reviewed Dec. 24, 2024 Gettin’ Muddy Never Felt So Good If you either own an ATV or dream of combining 4-wheel muddin’ with overnight campin’ then you have hit the jackpot here with Hog Waller Mud Campground & ATV Resort. As my post from a bit more than a year ago provided quite a bit of detail on this campground, I’m following up on that review by sharing additional fotos as well as providing a topline update: Highlights: (1) No shortage of mud-slinging fun for those ATV enthusiasts who want to spend all day long chasing trails with no end; (2) An incredibly unique and welcoming community of outdoor-motorcross enthusiasts; (3) Excellent topography to driving wild or hiking in the wild (but for the latter, make sure you wear bright orange); (4) Sites are spacious, flat and nicely shaded; (5) Despite being out in the boondocks, there’s an on-site restaurant and marketplace; (5) The restroom and shower facilities are actually pretty well-maintained and nicely outfitted. Lowlights: (1) There is nothing nearby to either stock up on supplies or grab a bite to eat, apart from the Hog Wild Country Café/ BBQ joint just a few minutes west of here, so when you come here, bring everything with you that you’ll need; (2) Maybe it is understood when you come into this place, but to state the obvious, this entire place is buzzing with ATVs, motorbikes and lots of other contraptions that makes for a loud atmosphere, so if you want peace & quiet, particularly on the weekends, you don’t want to check-in here; and (3) On the weekends, in particular, it feels like things get a too party-centric, so the music gets louder and the drinks often get the best of people, resulting in either louder chatter or, in a few cases, fights breaking out (but, to be fair, there’s always a few off-duty sheriffs watching the place, so things get broken up real quick). Happy Camping! Read More Month of Visit September (10) View All Share Report Stuart K. Legend Reviewed Jan. 28, 2023 Gettin’ Muddy Like a Hog I don’t think there’s anything like Hog Waller Campground & ATV Resort that I’ve ever come across (or even heard about) in all of my travels, so if gettin’ all muddied up is your idea of a yippee-kiyah good time, then look no further than due southwest of Palatka here in north central Florida. Basically, this 1,100 acre outdoor family fun park is for the outdoor recreational enthusiasts of the 4 wheeler type, where you’ll see all shapes, sizes and colors of ATVs and UTVs where everyone is hunkering down to see who can get the muddiest (note: trails are open only 9am to 5pm daily, so apparently no night muddin’!). Here at Hog Waller, you’ll discover decent bathing and restroom facilities along with several vendors who show up every weekend to provide fresh smoked BBQ, clothing, any type of soda or snack you can think of, as well as, the prerequisite hawkers selling branded clothing and ATV / UTV parts. There’s also a general store (the ‘Hoggy Woggly’), dump station, proper garbage and recycling bins as well as even an on-site restaurant cleverly titled 'Hog Trough' (although the menu is quite limiting). In all, there’s 63 available sites here with 55 areas (not slots, mind you) earmarked for RV pull-through or back-in slots (with typical 20 / 30 / 50 amp electric and water), 9 tent sites and 8 rustic cabins that come with 2 sets of bunk beds (no mattresses included though, which I found odd) that sleep 4 and offer heat/ air, power, inside and outside lighting. Note for tent campers like myself – Hog Waller is considered ‘dry camping,’ which was a new one for me. Basically, you can camp in any setup – car, bus, tent, dog house, whatever – but you have to stay 25 feet away from everything (roads, mud pit, buildings, etc.). The upside here is that you don’t need to make a reservation – you can just show up, pay the admission price and go find an empty place to camp for the night, but be sure to bring everything with you that you might need (e.g. water supply, generator). Additional amenities include: complimentary WiFi (that isn’t terribly great, given the remoteness of the place), swimming pool and campfire nights with live music on the weekends. Everywhere is pet-friendly, so bring your four-legged friends. Speaking of pets, as local legend goes, if you hear the squealing of what sounds like a wild boar or hog around the witching hour, have no fear, it's likely the monstrous beast that Hog Waller is named after! The security here, outfitted by Putnam County Sheriff Deputies, is excellent and further complemented by an onsite paramedic and volunteer fire fighters for each event, so you’ll enjoy having fun while feeling safe the whole time. Insider’s Tips? Here’s a few: (1) When you get tired of mudding it up on your ATV and prefer to go for a nice hike, check out Salt Springs Observation Trail in nearby Fort McCoy; (2) If you haven’t checked out Florida’s natural springs, you’re in luck as nearby Hog Waller is either Rock Springs or Silver Springs, both of which offer up glass-bottom kayak rentals that are pretty amazing if you haven’t had that experience yet; (3) If you come toting your kayak or canoe, you’ll have to go a bit further afield to drop your watercraft in Lake Ocklawaha – I recommend Rodman Recreation Area, just due south of Hog Waller, where they have a proper kayak launch near the dam; and (4) if you get tired of cooking up franks & beans, then head just due west down 310 (the 2 lane highway that runs in front of Hog Waller) and check out Hog Wild Country Café (yes, keeping with the 'hog' theme for as long as I possibly can here!) where I recommend the slab of ribs with cornbread or the smoked beef brisket (don’t miss out on the homemade cole slaw – some of the best I’ve had here in the South).

The board meets monthly to discuss budgets, events and other news about the fight against childhood brain cancer. The expert guidance of our volunteer board consistently drives Team Jack to new heights. Rex Burkhead Rex Burkhead is a retired running back of the National Football League. Originally drafted by Cincinnati in the sixth round (190th overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft, Burkhead spent four seasons with the New England Patriots, before signing with the Texans prior to the 2021 season. He was a key offensive contributor each season for the Patriots and was a member of the Patriots 2018 Super Championship team, scoring the last two touchdowns during the thrilling overtime AFC Championship against the Kansas City Chiefs. Burkhead played college football at the University of Nebraska, which is where his story with Team Jack began. Rex has played an important part to the development and ongoing success of the Team Jack Foundation. Not only does Burkhead serve as a board member on the Foundation’s board of directors, but he was instrumental in the Foundation’s inception itself. Team Jack was formed to raise funds for pediatric brain cancer research. Its namesake is Jack Hoffman, a 18-year-old from Nebraska who has been battling the disease for most of his life. Hoffman and Burkhead formed an unlikely friendship when Burkhead was a star player at Nebraska that has continued to this day. Hoffman even won a “Best Moment” ESPY award when he entered Nebraska’s 2013 spring game and scored a 69-yard touchdown while sporting No. 22, Burkhead’s number during his college days. The two even met President Barack Obama together at the White House in 2013. Rex is from Plano, TX, where he currently resides with this wife, Danielle, and two sons, Jett and Steel. Karen Carson Karen Carson is a Co-founder of Fat Brain Toys, a retailer and manufacturer of educational toys and games. Karen’s introduction to the toy industry came about at the suggestion of her then 10-year old son, Adam. In the Fall of 2002, after finding it difficult to locate specialty toys online, her son suggested that she and her husband Mark build their own website to better serve the growing demand for toys online. Carson accepted the challenge from her son and thus began a new career in the toy industry. Since 2002, Fat Brain Toys has grown into one of the largest online toy stores in the country. Recognizing the importance of a true multi-channel experience, Fat Brain Toys has since expanded into brick & mortar retail, opening retail store experiences in Omaha, Nebraska and Overland Park, Kansas. In addition to the company’s direct-to-consumer efforts, the company also designs and wholesales it’s own line of products to over 2,000 retailers around the world. Fat Brain Toys is a frequent benefactor to a number of non-profit organizations that support the needs of children, including: Team Jack Foundation, Omaha Children’s Hospital Foundation, Royal Family Kids, The Toy Bank, and many others. Karen has been married to her husband and business partner, Mark, since 1992, and lives in Elkhorn, Nebraska. Karen and Mark have three children, Adam, Makenzie, and Jenna.

Passionate. Gregarious. Brave. Selfless. Spiritual. Unwavering. These are just a few of the words used to describe our Team Jack Foundation co-founder, Andy Hoffman. Tributes have poured in from around the country following Andy’s passing on Monday, March 1. Andy was shockingly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a rare and very aggressive cancer, after having a seizure while running on the Cowboy Trail, in his hometown of Atkinson, Nebraska, in July 2020. Even after getting this devastating news, Andy was more determined than ever to find ways to raise money for Team Jack. And fast, while he was still able. Following his diagnosis, the Team Jack Foundation launched the “Twice the Fight” campaign as a way to show support for both Jack and Andy Hoffman’s brain cancer battles. One of Andy’s first visions to raise money for Team Jack was to sell t-shirts, and this time selling “Twice the Fight” t-shirts saw nearly 3,000 sold for over $65,000 raised. Earlier in 2020, Andy worked hard to fulfill his New Year’s resolution and finished writing his first book, “Yards After Contact” which details the family’s experience during Jack’s fight. It was published in October 2020 and has been a huge success. From the beginning, Andy made one thing clear with his book: 100% of the proceeds for the book sales go to Team Jack and, Team Jack would own the copyright to the book. To date, over 2,500 books have been sold, raising nearly $80,000 for Team Jack. In the book, Andy writes: “This book is the mission statement for the Team Jack Foundation, a Nebraska business that tirelessly works daily to improve brain cancer treatment in its region and nationally fund child brain cancer research. I hope you can open this book and know Jack and what his foundation stands for.” In early December, both ESPN and BigTen Networks produced shows giving an update on the Hoffmans’ life with cancer. The ESPN E:60 story aired as part of programming highlighting the importance of cancer research during ESPN’s 14th consecutive V Week on Dec.1-12. Andy spoke with Chris Connelly about his fight and his hopes for the future of those fighting childhood brain cancer. “This is going to sound screwy, but it’s been a blessing,” he said. “We’re supposed to thank God for the challenges that he gives us, and I’ve prayed the thank-you prayer. Thank you, God, for giving me brain cancer. Because he knows what he’s doing. And you don’t.” Check off another chance for Andy to raise awareness of this disease. Andy always looked to seize every opportunity to raise awareness for childhood brain cancer and fund research from some of the brightest research minds in the country. Although the Hoffmans knew the research they were funding may not benefit their son Jack, he did it for all the families down the road that will receive the horrible diagnosis of pediatric brain cancer. Andy remained hopeful even when faced with the grim nature of his prognosis. Andy worked hard to squeeze more life into his 42 years than most get in a lifetime. He did a couple of bucket list items, including a New Mexico elk hunt with his kids, his wife, and brothers during the last months of his life. He kept his unwavering faith and spent every moment possible with his family. In mid-February, his condition progressed, and his fight ended on Monday, March 1, where he peacefully passed away at home surrounded by his loving family. He is survived by his wife Brianna, children Jack, Ava and Reese, parents Gary and Karen Hoffman of Spencer, brothers Tony (Amy) Hoffman of Crofton and Michael (Jacky) Hoffman of Spencer, sister Julia (Chris) Jones of Tellico Plains, TN, parents-in-law Kerry and Bonnie Stiner of Burke, SD, sister-in-law Tiffany (Nate) Miller of Sioux Falls, SD, brother-in-law Kollin (Sarah) Stiner of Lakeville, MN, nephews Nathan Hoffman of Spencer, Hudson and Hayden Hoffman of Spencer, Luke Jones of Cleveland, OH, Matt and Nate Jones of Clarksburg, MD, Noah, Luke and Graham Miller of Sioux Falls, SD, and Karson Stiner of Lakeville, MN, nieces Alison (Justin) Wegenke of Fort Collins, CO, Samantha (Cody) Kahl of Grand Island, NE, Lauryn and Amelia Hoffman of Spencer, and Isabel and Nora Stiner of Lakeville, MN. He was also excited to be a Great Uncle to Will and Wren Wegenke and Alton Kahl. He was preceded in death by his brother Luke Hoffman. The Team Jack Foundation is committed to working harder than ever to ensure Andy’s legacy shines, and his mission grows. He had big ideas and big dreams for the foundation, and we will focus on making those a reality. He is irreplaceable and his smile and energy will be missed. But we will always follow the path he set to be a success. And fight on in his honor. How lucky we all are to have known him. * * Tragically, Jack’s dad, Andy Hoffman, was diagnosed with brain cancer (glioblastoma) in July of 2020. He battled for seven months before passing away from the disease. The Team Jack Foundation is committed to upholding Andy’s legacy by working harder than ever to fund the cure for childhood brain cancer. Team Jack Staff Team Jack’s caring, driven staff is dedicated to ending childhood brain cancer by pushing Team Jack forward every day.

Ride safe and have a blast at Idaho Dunes RV! Meet the Team Mike McGroarty Owner Mike McGroarty has been an off-road, aviation, and outdoor enthusiast his entire life.  At the age of 15, Mike earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America and by that time had over 300 nights of wilderness camping experience.  His love for the outdoors turned into a passion for off-roading as soon as his first job earned him enough income to purchase his first sport ATV.  This first ATV started an addiction for rock crawling, trail riding and sand duning that still occupies 100% of Mike’s interest to this day. Garrett McGroarty Manager Garrett McGroarty was born into the “Idaho Dunes Way of Life”.  At 3 years old, Garrett started his off-road passion on a Kawasaki KFX 50.  Garrett has logged more trail miles between Idaho Dunes RV and West Yellowstone than anyone in the area.  At a young age, Garrett developed a passion for helicopters and aviation.  Before graduating from high school, Garrett earned both his private helicopter license (PPL-H) and commercial helicopter license (CPL-H).  With advanced pilot training from the best instructors in the industry at Helisafe in Southern California, Garrett has mastered the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopters flight systems and emergency procedures.  If you have questions about the campground, dunes, local area, trail rides, or helicopter tours Garrett is your best bet to get the answers you are looking for.
