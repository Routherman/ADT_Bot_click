Provo city officials are renaming the recently reconfigured East Bay Golf Course back to its former name of Timpanogos Golf Club, Mayor Michelle Kaufusi announced via Facebook Live Wednesday. “It is my honor today to preserve this beautiful piece of our history for many more generations to come,” Kaufusi said. “Today we reveal a redesigned course and a name that brings our golf past together with generational vision of our golf future.” The course, which reopened all 18 holes on Sept. 30 after over a year of reconfiguration work, originally opened in 1923 as the Provo Golf and Country Club. After officials renamed it in 1927, it was known as Timpanogos Golf Club for nearly 60 years. It wasn’t until 1986 that the course was renamed East Bay following an extensive expansion project. Speaking after Kaufusi at the renaming ceremony live streamed from the course, head golf pro Brett Watson shared a few insights into the recently finished reconfiguration project. Following a 2018 land acquisition that included part of the course’s front-nine holes, Watson and golf architect Kevin Atkinson immediately started working on design plans, and felt the need to change the course's name from the get-go. https://twitter.com/timpgolfclub/status/1313898901527654403 “We realized that East Bay had always been a great fixture in the community, but it needed a name change,” Watson said. “We started thinking for names, and it just kind of came back that Timpanogos was the only option.” Watson went on to explain how nervous he was once they settled on the name, feeling he and his staff had some “big shoes to fill.” Motivated by the new name, Watson and Atkinson angled several of the new tee shots towards Mount Timpanogos in hopes of 'changing the golf experience in the state of Utah.” “For those of you who have played it, I don’t think you’ve played anything like it, certainly in the state of Utah,” Watson said. “That was one thing that we were incredibly excited about.” A number of Utah residents have already shared their stamp of approval on the redesigned course via social media. Fairways Media president Randy Dodson said there is “really nothing like it anywhere in Utah.” “Got a sneak peek round in today of the brand new 18-holes at East Bay GC. WOW!” Dodson wrote in a Sept. 29 Facebook post . “A challenge for all golfers. Par 5’s are legit. Holes signs and tee markers are very cool. Another year of growth and after construction scars heal, the golf course will be killer.” The first hole at the redesigned former East Bay Golf Course is one of five par 5's throughout the 18-hole course. Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi announced the renaming of the course to Timpanogos Golf Club on Wednesday, Oct. 7. (Josh Carter) Deseret News columnist Dick Harmon, who joined Dodson for their preview round, shared his enthusiasm for the new course via Twitter. “Historic Day! First foursome to play brand new front 9 at @EastBayGC,” Harmon wrote on Sept. 29 . “And wait to you see the island green! Fun, distinctive, great change ups and the par 5s…oh, my…” The reconfigured par-72 course features five par-5 holes, eight par-4 holes and five par-3’s. The course is 7,056 yards long from the tips and, as Harmon mentioned, includes an island green on the 14 th hole. In addition to the fresh 18-hole course, Timpanogos Golf Club also features an expanded 9-hole par-3 course with lights as well as a lighted driving range. The golf club also sports two new chipping and putting greens.

During his entrepreneurial career, Robert founded Northern California’s first monthly golf publication and was instrumental in directing Visit California’s golf marketing initiative to raise global awareness for the state as a top-tier golf destination. His work can be viewed at Picture PARfect . The big-ticket landscape of the greater Bay Area, from bustling cosmopolitan cities to quiet coastal communities, has been gifted with an exceptionally diverse collection of communal golf courses layered with a rich frosting of history, from the architects who conceived them to some of the greatest wizards of the links, including Johnny Miller and Ken Venturi, who honed their skills on the sidehill, uphill, and downhill lies around the doglegged fairways. Whether a local or visitor, there’s a golf challenge to suit any size wallet. Here are some of the best golf courses in the East Bay. Feature Photo: Courtesy of Poppy Ridge Golf Club Photo: Robert Kaufman Corica Park ALAMEDA Year built: North Course (1927); South Course (1957) Architect: North Course (William Park Bell) / Redesign by Marc Logan (2022); South Course (William Francis Bell / Redesign by Rees Jones (2018) Number of holes: 45 (North Course/South Course/Mif Albright 9 Par 3) Practice Area: Driving range, short game area F ood & Beverage : Jim’s on the Course Sports Bar & Grill Golf down under on the island city of Alameda at the Bay Area’s only Australian sand-belt style course. After a dramatic restoration (2018) to the South Course by famed architect Rees Jones, the minimalist 6,874-yard layout plays fast and firm with the option to strike the ball to the hole by air or ground. The property, five minutes from Oakland International Airport, is also home to the North Course (under renovation; 9 holes due to open June 2021) and one of America’s top nine-hole, par-3 courses. Photo: Courtesy of Hiddenbrooke Golf Club Hiddenbrooke Golf Club VALLEJO Year built: 1995 Architect: Arnold Palmer Number of holes: 18 Practice Area: Driving range, chipping area, and putting green Food & Beverage: Hiddenbrooke Grill A former host to the LPGA’s Samsung World Championships of Golf (2000-2002), the acclaimed an Arnold Palmer Signature golf course is nestled in a scenic secluded valley just north of San Francisco. At 6,619 yards with dramatic elevation changes, large challenging greens and water on 14 of the 18 holes, the award-winning (4.5-star rating from Golf Digest) Hiddenbrooke GC provides five sets of tees to accommodate beginning to advanced golfers. Photo: Courtesy of Metropolitan Golf Links Metropolitan Golf Links OAKLAND Year built: 2003 Architect: Johnny Miller/Fred Bliss Number of holes: 18 Practice Area: All-grass driving range, short game practice area Food & Beverage: Snacks and drinks In the tradition of great links courses, Johnny Miller and Fred Bliss designed 18 holes right next to Oakland International Airport with a spacious and open feel giving the thinking golfer a variety of options depending upon the wind and appetite for risk/reward. With a backdrop of the Oakland Hills, Bay, downtown Oakland and San Francisco, the compact 6,959-yard layout includes straight holes, doglegs and even a couple double doglegs throughout the subtle mounding and wetland areas. Photo: Courtesy of Poppy Ridge Golf Club Poppy Ridge Golf Club LIVERMORE Year built: 1996 Architect: Rees Jones Number of holes: 27 (three nines) Practice Area: All-grass driving range, pitching green w/bunker, and three putting greens Food & Beverage: Grill at Poppy Ridge In the heart of Livermore Wine Country, the 27-hole Rees Jones design is reminiscent of the Scottish heathland courses. Three nines as distinct as the grape varietals they are named after — Merlot, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel — sweep through 3,000 acres of savannah-covered hills to provide challenges for golfers of any skill level. Each hole is shaped by extensive bunkering to reinforce the feel of a true links-style course and each nine closes with a lakeside green in front of the hacienda-style clubhouse. Photo: Robert Kaufman The Course at Wente Vineyards LIVERMORE Year built: 1998 Architect: Greg Norman Number of holes: 18 Practice Area: Driving range, putting green, chipping green, short game practice area Food & Beverage: The Grill Greg “The Shark” carved an 18-hole masterpiece through acres of century-old grapevines and rolling hills in the scenic Livermore Valley Wine Country. The Course at Wente Vineyards (1998), 50 minutes east of San Francisco, provides eye-candy panoramas to compliment a 7,181-yard layout that once challenged (2006-08) the PGA Tour’s Nationwide Tour (now Korn Ferry Tour).

We pay respect to Elders past, present and emerging and recognise their connection to the land. Tree sculpture Thanks to some creative thinking, Eastwood Golf Club now boasts one of the most distinctive natural landmarks of any course in Australia. Adjacent to the 1st tee stood a large Cypress tree that posed a safety risk due to its condition and was earmarked to be removed. However, rather than electing for full removal, the Club recognised an opportunity and instead opted to turn the surviving trunk into a unique work of art. With the assistance of sponsorship from two members, Mike Rawlinson and Roger Earle, the Club commissioned renowned chainsaw sculptor Rob Bast to create a wood carving with the intention of becoming a feature landmark at the course. The design features a golfer with golf bag and clubs, accompanied by birdlife. The project commenced in March 2015 and took two weeks to complete. “The sculpture is simply stunning. Rob did an amazing job and exceeded all our expectations. The skill and level of detail that has gone into the work and what he was able to achieve using chainsaws as his tools is quite incredible,” he comments. “We always thought our course here at Eastwood was special, but we now have a landmark that is truly unique. It has become a major talking point amongst members and guests.
