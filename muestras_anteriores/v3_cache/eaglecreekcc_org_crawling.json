Mission & Vision Our Mission Deliver an excellent club experience and championship caliber golf to member families and their guests at an unparalleled value. Our Vision A distinctly approachable club where everyone feels welcome. Club Values Integrity & Respect We value honesty, transparency, and fairness, treating every member with respect while upholding club traditions and rules. Quality We are committed to doing things the right way, ensuring fiscal responsibility, strong governance, and well-maintained facilities. Community We foster an inclusive, welcoming environment where members support one another, engage in club activities, and help strengthen our club’s future. A History of Golf and Community Argyle Country Club was founded on the belief that golf should be welcoming, accessible, and family-friendly—a place where working families could build a community and enjoy the game without the formality of a traditional country club. Founded in 1923, Argyle started as a small club in Washington, DC, before relocating to Sligo Creek Golf Course in Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1945, Argyle moved again to its current 150-acre property, which was originally a working dairy farm. The old barn was converted into a clubhouse, and members came together to help shape the course and facilities. Through the years, Argyle has expanded and improved while staying true to its roots—a club where championship golf and genuine camaraderie come first. Today, with over 500 member families, Argyle remains a welcoming, family-friendly community with a passion for the game. Meet the Argyle Team Behind every exceptional club is a dedicated team of professionals who bring passion, experience, and a commitment to excellence. At Argyle, our leadership ensures that every round of golf, tennis match, and club gathering is an experience to remember.
