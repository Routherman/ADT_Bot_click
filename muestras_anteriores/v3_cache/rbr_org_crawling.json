Welcome to the Bluegrass Country festival calendar.  We list bluegrass, old time and Americana festivals at date, in the US and around the world. This year we’re listing festivals outside the US on the same monthly pages as US festivals. If you know about a festival that isn’t on our list, please send us the information . “Bluegrass festival” is a broad category, encompassing old time fiddlers’ conventions, family weekends, street fairs, mega-music festivals and everything in between.  We’ve provided links to the festival websites so you can check the lineups, schedules, admission fees, facilities, whether there’s camping, jamming etc. Our calendar only lists events when we have confirmed dates, preferably from a current secure website or Facebook page .  Check back often, as we add new events when we find them. So pack up your instruments, load the camper and hit the road! UPDATES. Check the calendar for details.  Our online calendar starts with the current month. Click here to order a printable (PDF) copy of the calendar, listing over 560 festivals in 2025.
