Breakwater Hospitality ( The Wharf ) revived and updated the landmark restaurant a couple of years after we thought we had lost it forever. I was skeptical about the changes and the revamp because, often, these renovations tend to unknowingly remove the restaurant’s essence. You have nothing to worry about; it is still John Martin’s but with a contemporary vibe. John Martin’s – Quick Info John Martin’s Irish Pub in Coral Gables, Florida John Martin’s Irish Pub 📍 253 Miracle Mile, Coral Gables, FL 📞 (305) 209-0609 🌐 johnmartinsmiami.com 📸 Instagram | Facebook 🕒 Hours: Mon–Wed: 4:00 PM – 12:00 AM Thu–Fri: 4:00 PM – 2:00 AM Sat: 11:30 AM – 2:00 AM Sun: 11:00 AM – 12:00 AM John Martin’s Menu We were given the lunch menu to peruse, and I went online to compare it to the dinner one . The only real difference appears to be the removal of sandwiches and adding a Daily Chef Special . Don’t forget about Sunday’s brunch menu ! Lunch Menu Back at John Martin’s The bar, where I ate many lunch meals and drank plenty of ice-cold draft beers, was beautifully redone. The Bar John Martin’s Lager The front room now has a sunroof that lets natural light into the space. Marcela and I chose to sit there for lunch. The portraits of John Martin’s founders, John Clarke and Martin Lynch , are a nice touch. Co-founder John Clarke’s portrait Appetizers and Small Plates I was tempted to get the soup but saved myself for the truffle pastrami croquetas, chicken wings, and osso bucco pig wings. The pork belly bites and Guinness-glazed meatballs also made it to our table. We dove into the croqueta first since I can’t resist minced meat in mini-spheres. They didn’t disappoint, even though I’m not much for truffles. Truffle Pastrami Croquetas The Irish-chicharrones, aka the pork belly bites ( pork, belly chunks, honey garlic glaze, green kale, sesame seeds, scallions ), and their glaze are perfect for snacking on at the bar while sipping drinks. Pork Belly Bites Their chargrilled chicken wings are phenomenal and disruptive with that char. These fellas caught me totally off guard. If you dip them in any sauce, I would consider calling the cops on you after I take them away from you because you don’t deserve them. Chicken Wings The osso bucco pork wings are the love child of the pork belly and chicken wings. It inherited the attributes of each parent, but I preferred their parents, sorry, son. Mini Pork Osso Bucco Marcela prefers those overprocessed meatballs that are all over the freezer aisles in supermarkets, so she steered clear of Guinness-glazed meatballs. It was great news for a meatball lover like me cause they were freakin’ delicious, and that bed of cheddar grits they were laying on was next level. Guinness Glazed Meatballs Just as all the appetizers and small plates came out, the server brought a platter that included buffalo, harissa, ketchup, and Au Poivre sauces. I was so enamored with the dishes that I didn’t pay much attention, but I did catch Marcela dipping fries in them. A Selection of Sauces Ribs for Marcela What about baby back ribs and three different burgers, if that wasn’t enough? I tried the spare ribs, but I’m not an expert. I like to stick to what I know about. Were they tasty? Hell yeah, but they’re more in Marcela ‘s wheelhouse, and she didn’t stop raving about them. However, that street corn elote won my heart. Baby Back Ribs Burger Talk The Bacon Smash , the Guinness , and John Martin’s Signature Burger s arrive almost simultaneously, like a photo finish in a well-contested foot race. I’m not sure why I thought that this would be a good idea after everything else, but your BEAST must come through for you. All these fellas are half-pounders with a side of fries, so loosen up your belt before consumption: Bacon Smash Burger – Two 8oz smash patties with caramelized onions, bacon jam, American cheese, and John Martin’s signature sauce on a potato bun Bacon Smash Burger The Guinness – 8oz dry-aged beef patty topped with arugula, a beer brat sausage, and creamy Guinness beer brie fondue on a soft pretzel bun The Guinness Burger John Martin’s Signature Burger – 8oz house-blend burger topped with arugula, tomatoes, caramelized onions, roasted pork belly, John Martin’s signature sauce, and a Tallegio truffle fondue on a toasted brioche bun John Martin’s Signature Burger Which was my favorite? I gotta give it to the John Martin’s Signature Burger . The trio of caramelized onions, roasted pork belly, and Tallegio truffle fondue sealed the deal. I need to mention the fries, which were fantastic but impossible to eat alongside the burger after the spread we ate. *Thank you to Breakwater Hospitality ‘s Emi Guerra for inviting Marcela and me for lunch. We thoroughly enjoyed our conversation about the renovations to John Martin’s and the plans for the future. On a side note, we previously worked with his brother, Eddy Guerra , during our Camacho Bold Burger Battle tour.

Breakwater Hospitality Group’s Emi Guerra and Alex Mantecon, in partnership with Erick Passo, owner of Downtown’s Black Market Miami, renovated and reopened the storied eatery in fall 2022. John and Martin were childhood friends from Killinkere parish in northwest Dublin who moved to Miami in the late 80s. The restaurant was modeled after their beloved neighborhood pubs from their homeland and quickly became a beloved gathering place that helped revitalize Miracle Mile. Previous slide Next slide ONE OF OUR LATEST PROJECTS: REOPENING CORAL GABLES’ ICONIC JOHNMARTIN’S IRISH PUB & RESTAURANT Founded in 1989 by John Clarke and Martin Lynch , childhood friends from Killinkere parish in northwest Dublin who moved to Miami in the late 80s, JohnMartin’s has returned as the quintessential Irish pub for today and beyond, with a fresh, contemporary aesthetic rooted in tradition and heritage. The revamped venue, designed by Bigtime Design Studios , pays homage to the original JohnMartin’s while creating a welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere that’s both contemporary and enduring. It has reopened under the leadership of industry veterans Emi Guerra and Alex Mantecon of Breakwater Hospitality Group, the minds behind Miami entertainment staple The Wharf, and Erick Passo , owner of Downtown’s Black Market Miami. “It’s an honor to carry on the legacy of this iconic venue with a fresh, modern take on a traditional Irish pub,” said Guerra, co-founder of Breakwater Hospitality Group. “JohnMartin’s has been a staple in the community for decades and has so much history, especially for those of us who grew up in Miami and understand JohnMartin’s significance as a beloved wateringhole and gathering place.” Opening daily at 11:30 a.m., the restaurant will serve lunch and dinner, with extensive food offerings including a selection of Irish fan favorites, sandwiches, flatbreads, small plates and “afters” for dessert. Dishes range from traditional staples like Shepherd’s pie and fish and chips to more inventive offerings including Guinness glazed meatballs and duck flatbread, as well as mouthwatering burgers and crowd-pleasing entrees like ribeye steak and baby back ribs. The renovated venue showcases many original millwork and architectural elements of the building as well as eclectic furnishings from the era repurposed for contemporary socializing. The venue’s grand 43-foot-long bar, once mahogany, has received a black and white makeover with a gleaming quartz countertop and charcoal-stained wainscoting. Behind the bar, JohnMartin’s regulars will recognize the historic centerpiece from the original millwork that’s been painted and is now flanked by light oak wood shelving. This fond reminder of the venue’s previous incarnation is juxtaposed with modern flat-screen TVs lining the wall for sports fans to watch their team play on game day – an essential function of any bona fide Irish pub. “We feel a great responsibility as the stewards of this Miami institution that has meant so much to so many of us locals,” said Alex Mantecon, co-founder of Breakwater Hospitality Group. “Our goal is to create something that welcomes all the loyal regulars and fans who’ve been coming here for years while also bridging the gap for a new generation to discover and embrace JohnMartin’s alongside them. We can’t wait to open our doors and hope JohnMartin’s can continue to be a pillar of the community as it has been for more than 30 years.” JohnMartin’s is located at 253 Miracle Mile in Coral Gables.
