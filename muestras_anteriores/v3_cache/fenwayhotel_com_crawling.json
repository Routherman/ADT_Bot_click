The move comes as Premier Investments evaluates a possible demerger of some of its businesses, including brands Peter Alexander and Smiggle. Premier said on Monday that the decision to undertake a review “recognises the increased scale of Premier Retail’s various businesses, and the substantial opportunities for each of them”. It hired UBS and Arnold Bloch Leibler. A major investor in Myer, speculation mounted that Murray was joining Premier Investments in an effort to bolster the management experience of the business with a view to mounting a run at owning Myer. Earlier today it was announced that Murray, a key player in the Liberal Party, will step down as the head of Premier Retail on September 15, and relinquished his executive director status from today. John Bryce, Premier Retail’s long-standing chief financial officer, has been appointed as interim CEO. During the past 12 months Murray has been responsible for lifting forecast earnings before interest and tax for the group’s retail business with the latest forecast being between $355 million and $357 million, compared to a consensus forecast of around. Premier shares surged 12.46% per cent on the latest trading news. I’s also emerged that Solomon Lew is considering splitting Premier into four separate companies by demerging sleepwear chain Peter Alexander, kids’ stationery shop Smiggle and Premier’s remaining retail brands, including Just Jeans, Portman, and Jacqui-E. The AFR said today that where JB Hi-Fi is more of a traditional middleman retailer, having perfected the art of selling big brands at great prices, Premier is far more vertically integrated, in that it manages the design, sourcing, manufacture and distribution of fashion products that have a different shelf-life to electronics and whitegoods. Murray was always open about the adjustment required in shifting from one model to the other. Macquarie has put a valuation of $1.2 billion on Peter Alexander and $559 million on Smiggle, and a $248 million valuation on the remaining retail business. Mr Lew told investors “It is business as usual” and he “understands Richard’s decision to step down”. “The Premier board is focused on moving forward with its formal review as announced today, under the strong leadership of Mr Bryce and the senior management team, whilst continuing to focus on the first-rate retail execution that Premier is known for,” Mr Lew said in a statement. The AFR has reported that the retailer group expects to report record global retail sales for the 52 weeks ended July 29 of $1.64 billion, up 9.7 per cent on fiscal 2022 sales. Premier Retail now expects record earnings before interest and tax (excluding significant items) within a range of $355 million to $357 million, an increase of between 6 per cent and 6.6 per cent. Additionally, management is currently considering a spin-off, of pyjamas brand Peter Alexander where sales have more than doubled from five years ago. In March, Premier flagged it was considering overseas markets for the brand. Peter Alexander plans to open 20 to 30 new or larger-format stores in the near-term in Australia and New Zealand. Premier Retail’s apparel segment spans its five heritage brands: Portmans, Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Jacqui E and Dotti. In June, The Australian Financial Review revealed multiple executives were leaving the business. At this stage it’s not known whether Murray is going to stay in retail or enter politics for the Liberal party.

By Kailyn Brown Staff Writer Follow Nov. 7, 2024 3 AM PT Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print Listening bars, often referred to as jazz kissas — where people can relax and listen to vinyl records carefully selected by a bartender over a high fidelity sound system — have been popular in Japan since the 1950s. In recent years, listening bars have been popping up in the U.S. There’s a handful of them in Los Angeles, along with other events that encourage people to be present with the music and actively engage with it. On a recent Thursday night in Hollywood, I walked into Grandmaster Recorders , a storied former recording studio — where artists like Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan and the Red Hot Chili Peppers once laid down tracks — now transformed into a rooftop bar and restaurant. After grabbing a drink, I found a seat in the dimmed room, which was filled with more than 100 other music aficionados all there to do one thing: Listen to Frank Ocean’s critically acclaimed album, “Channel Orange,” on vinyl. The hosts played the record over a high fidelity (hi-fi for short) audio system — a term used to describe the high-quality reproduction of sound — that sounded so crisp that it felt like Ocean was singing live in front of us. I’d listened to the album at least 300 times before and have seen Ocean perform live, but I’d never experienced the record in this way before. Planning your weekend? Stay up to date on the best things to do, see and eat in L.A . “I think listening to [music] on your own is amazing,” says Free Oribhabor, founder of the Record Club , an album listening event that he’s been hosting in Los Angeles for nearly two years. “But there’s just something about doing it in a room with other people that makes it even more special. It just magnifies the experience of listening to music, especially if you just zero in on the music and allow yourself to go where it’s taking you. It’s like a group meditation.” The Record Club is just one of a handful of experiences or public places in L.A. where audiophiles — folks who are obsessed with high-quality sound and audio gadgets — can gather, relax and vibe out to music with other likeminded people. Unlike regular bars, where people often go to socialize, turn up and dance, listening bars typically have a more laid-back vibe, and the intent is to actively listen to the music. It’s a space where you can be completely present with what you’re hearing. Advertisement Many of these spaces are inspired by Japanese listening bars (known as jazz kissaten or jazz kissas), where patrons can listen to vinyl records that are carefully selected by a bartender from the venue’s collection on hi-fi sound equipment, while they enjoy Japanese whiskey, coffee and other beverages. At some jazz kissas, which have been popular in Japan since the 1950s, talking is prohibited at certain times. In recent years, listening bars have been popping up in New York, Oakland, L.A. and other major U.S. cities. Among the first Japanese-inspired vinyl bars to open in L.A. was In Sheep’s Clothing in 2018, started by a record label and vinyl collective of the same name. It was shuttered during the COVID pandemic, but the team is planning to open a new lounge in the near future. “It feels like almost an explosion of it happening all over the world,” says Phil Cho of In Sheep’s Clothing, which currently has a pop-up record store at the Row DTLA. Despite In Sheep’s Clothing closing its hi-fi bar during the pandemic, Cho says the shutdown likely played a role in the boom of listening bars across the U.S. “I think when the world started opening back up again, these spaces became a good in-between point for people to socialize and listen to music.” The magic of listening to music at a vinyl bar or a similar space is the sound quality. Not only do you have to build a record collection (the rise of listening bars may be in part due to the resurgence of vinyl records ), but a hi-fi system at home can cost a pretty penny. If you want to buy your own setup, it can cost upward of $1,500 for speakers, an amplifier, turntables and the cables needed to connect it all, depending on the brand, according to Wesley Katzir, owner of Common Wave Hi-Fi . Advertisement “I always thought that hi-fi speakers were kind of an exclusive thing to have — like you could only go to bougie spots to listen to music on there,” says Elwood Espiritu, who hosts an album listening party called Slow Jamz in the Arts District. “And they’re just playing jazz, but no one’s playing Ginuwine or Jon B., so I was like, ‘Dang, I want to make a change for that and give people access to listen to music in that way.’” While New York is home to several hi-fi bars , there are surprisingly only a few in L.A. For this reason, this list highlights vinyl lounges and ongoing events like the Record Club that play vinyl records over hi-fi sound systems and create an environment where people can engage with the music in a more meaningful and deeper way.

Print Share (Kailyn Brown / Los Angeles Times) When most people think of hi-fi bars in Los Angeles, the first one that usually comes to mind is Gold Line bar in Highland Park. That’s mainly because it was one of the first and it’s beloved by Angelenos and musicians alike. Open since 2018, the vinyl-centered cocktail lounge is situated underneath Stones Throw Records’ office and is co-owned by the label’s founder, Chris Manak (a.k.a. DJ Peanut Butter Wolf), label manager Jason McGuire and restaurateur Tyler Bell. The centerpiece of the chic space is Manak’s wall-to-wall collection of more than 15,000 records, which are housed behind the DJ booth and long wooden bar. Bartenders and guest DJs are allowed to pick and play their favorites, but if they want to play an outside record, it must then join the Gold Line collection when they leave. Grammy-winning artists such as jazz pianist Robert Glasper and singer Anderson .Paak — his duo NxWorries is signed to Stones Throw — have hosted parties here. Patrons can sit on the many cozy stools near the bar or on the couches toward the back of the venue as they listen to an array of genres like Japanese funk, dance/electronic and ’90s hip-hop. Gold Line is still a bar, so don’t expect for people to be quiet here. But don’t worry, the music usually is playing at house-party levels, so you’ll still be able to enjoy it.

Restaurant and lounge Call Route Website Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print Share (Kailyn Brown / Los Angeles Times) After visiting several listening bars in Tokyo and other parts of the world, TJ Johnson, an L.A.-based DJ and chef, wanted to launch her own version to merge both of her passions. The result is Wax on Hi-Fi, part vinyl listening bar, part restaurant, where patrons can enjoy a blend of American, creole and Japanese cuisine like miso mac and pork belly jambalaya fried rice, while listening to everything from jazz to house records on vinyl. “As a solo traveler, I would hang out at the record bars [in Japan] and I thought it was such a cool experience to have a place to just listen to music and meet other people who just wanted to listen to music in a nice, chill environment. Not like a club setting,” says Johnson, adding that she’s found a similar vibe at Bar Shiru in Oakland as well as Long Play , a cafe in San Diego. Open since June, Wax on Hi-Fi is located across the street from the Last Bookstore in downtown L.A. and is beneath the Alexandria Hotel. The sleek and spacious venue offers weekly programming including movie nights (vinyl DJ sets inspired by films with great soundtracks like “Love Jones”), game nights and open tables for DJs. “I know what it’s like to be a DJ who doesn’t have a place to gig at or you’re trying to test your talent out in front of people,” says Johnson, adding that the open-tables event has helped her connect with other local DJs. Wax on Hi-Fi’s impressive sound system includes a Isonoe ISO420 mixer, Technics SL-1200 turntables, McIntosh MA8950 amplifier and JBL speakers. Just as intentional as the record collection are the drinks at Wax on Hi-Fi, including cocktails such as a sake highball and Obon , a cocktail with nigori sake and soju that is named after a Japanese festival that honors the dead.

Print Share (The Record Club) At least once a month, dozens of music enthusiasts gather at Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood to listen to a featured album on vinyl together. Hosted by the Record Club , the event strongly discourages talking and phone usage, much like at a movie theater, as the founders want attendees to actively engage with the music that they play on a hi-fi system (a 1200 Technics turntable, an E&S DJR400 rotary mixer, an Audio-Technica VM540ML needle and a Pioneer CDJ-3000). A projector screen displays the album’s track list and guests sit in rows of chairs or on a bench as they sip cocktails inspired by the specific album. “When you get into a room with some great speakers and you listen to the album on vinyl, it’s like you’re sitting in the studio with the artist while they’re recording,” says founder Free Oribhabor. Before each session, Oribhabor plays early records from the featured artists and dives deep into the artist’s discography, so attendees can gain a deeper understanding of the music they’re listening to. Eddie Junior, the Record Club’s “sound wizard” and DJ, handles the records. The intimate events typically sell out — capacity is roughly 120 attendees — and tickets start at $25. So far, the Record Club has hosted listening sessions for D’Angelo’s “Voodoo,” Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly,” Sade’s “Diamond Life,” Stevie Wonder’s “Innervisions,” N.E.R.D’s “Fly or Die” and more. It also holds bimonthly sessions at Public Records in New York City and has plans to expand to other cities in the near future. Show more Show less Route Details In Sheep's Clothing Downtown L.A. Record store Route Website Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print Share (Clark Studio) In Sheep’s Clothing opened a listening bar in the Arts District in 2018 — the first of its kind in Los Angeles — but it was closed during the pandemic. However, the team still hosts listening experiences at other venues throughout L.A. such as Neuehouse, where it had a four-month residency, and at its headquarters in West Hollywood. Also, In Sheep’s Clothing currently has a pop-up record shop in collaboration with independent radio station Dublab at Row DTLA , where the staff holds record pop-ups, release parties, listening sessions, live performances and other music events. The shop’s hi-fi set up isn’t as robust as the former bar‘s system, which cost more than a luxury car and is stored at the collective’s headquarters, but it’s still impactful. On a typical day, you’re bound to hear an artist you’ve probably never heard of — but will come to love — or a new release playing over a pair of JBL speakers. Good news for music lovers: In Sheep’s Clothing is planning to open a new listening bar in L.A. in the near future, according to Phil Cho, who runs the brand’s events, website and social media. Soon visitors will be able to enjoy coffee, tea, Japanese whiskey and other beverages as they vibe out to music for hours as they did at the original spot, which is worth celebrating.

Event Route Website Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print Share (Max Garcia) Picture this: You’re sitting in a gallery filled with album-cover posters and other music memorabilia, sipping on wine as you and a room full of other music lovers sing Usher’s “ Confessions ” aloud. This may sound like a karaoke bar, but it’s actually Vinyl and Vino, a high-energy album listening party hosted by Slow Jamz. Founded by Elwood Espiritu, Slow Jamz started as an Instagram mood board — which now has more than 120,000 followers — and brand in 2017. It’s since turned into a collective of creatives (DJs, graphic designers, etc.), who host an array of events and other programming at their 2,400-square-foot gallery space in the Arts District and other venues throughout L.A. The space also has a coffee shop ( Flow Good Coffee ) and retail store. Among Slow Jamz’ most popular parties is Vinyl and Vino, which Espiritu and his team started hosting in April 2023. At the event, the hosts play beloved albums such as Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” and “Dangerously in Love,” Justin Bieber’s “Journals,” Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” Kanye West’s “Graduation,” “Riot!” by Paramore and “Take Care” by Drake. Unlike the Record Club where attendees are asked to limit chatter to avoid distraction, Vinyl and Vino guests are encouraged to get out of their seats to dance and sing aloud. (In fact, the Record Club hosted its first event at the Slow Jamz gallery in February 2023.) At the beginning of the night, the Vinyl and Vino hosts provide snacks of information about the featured album, before playing it on vinyl. The Slow Jamz sound system, which they bought at Common Wave Hi-Fi, includes Klipsch Cornwall IV speakers and Technics 1210 turntables. The party is B.Y.OB. (bring your own beverages) and typically happens twice a month. “There’s a lot of hi-fi bars in New York and everywhere else except L.A., but it’s nice to be able to offer [this] to the people,” says Espiritu, adding that his goal is to help people make connections with others through music and nostalgia. “A lot of the magic is in the space that we’re in.” Show more Show less Route Details Common Wave Hi-Fi Boyle Heights Record store Call Route Website Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print Share (Kailyn Brown / Los Angeles Times) Tucked in an industrial area between the Arts District and Boyle Heights is Common Wave Hi-Fi, a design-forward audio showroom, record store and social listening space that is a utopia for audiophiles. To get inside the space, you’ll have to walk toward the metal gate on South Anderson Street and type the numbers “106” into the call box to get buzzed in. Then you’ll walk past a small patio area that leads you to the entrance. Once inside the space, the first thing you’ll see is the record shop, which sells everything from classic rock and soul to electronic and hip-hop. Open since 2018, Common Wave Hi-Fi is a cozy, aesthetically pleasing musical haven filled with stereo gadgetry that looks like pieces of art. Many of the sound systems are limited production and bespoke designs made in places like New York, Japan, Switzerland, France and Sweden. Founder Wesley Katzir, who has a background in furniture and experimental design, designed the 3,500-square-foot space to be approachable for music lovers of all kinds. So you don’t have to be an expert to appreciate it. Katzir and staff members walk customers through different audio scenarios, ask you about your favorite music genres and encourage you to touch the items in order to figure out which setup is perfect for you. Common Wave Hi-Fi also throws occasional events including DJ sets, live musical performances and listening sessions. Most recently, the shop hosted an event called “Hi-Fi Night School,” where for 12 weeks a different curator presented and played an album that means a lot to them. Among the guest sound selectors have been Aaron Frazer of Durand Jones & the Indications and former KCRW host Mathieu Schreyer. Afterward, Katzir would teach the crowd a hi-fi concept, such as CD versus vinyl or new versus old pressings. Proceeds from the ticket sales for “Hi-Fi Night School” event went to LAUSD schools to help raise funds for a music teacher. Katzir said he hopes to bring the event back in the near future.

LANE TURNER/GLOBE STAFF All along, it was supposed to be another cookie-cutter hotel/apartment complex, on the site of the Howard Johnson in the Fenway. Raze the squat and outdated motel, and then build as high as possible to make the most money. It’s a formula being repeated from the Back Bay to the Seaport District. High-end is no longer high enough. The latest example: A second Four Seasons will anchor a 60-story tower near the Christian Science Plaza. But for developer Steve Samuels, all that opulence was too mundane. “Let’s not tear down the Howard Johnson,” he texted business partner Robin Brown. To which Brown responded, as calmly as he could: “What?” Samuels had a vision for how they could take advantage of the memories connected to the HoJo. His thinking: Amid a sea of new towers, including some he built, preserving the old 94-room motel would add character to one of Boston’s hottest new neighborhoods. Get Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up Born was The Verb , an anti-chain establishment that would pay homage to Fenway/Kenmore Square’s raucous rock club scene of the ’70s and ’80s. The area was, at one time, home to joints such as the Boston Tea Party, where you could see the biggest acts before they got too big — Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, J. Geils Band, The Who. Later, the soon-to-be-famous Police would take to the rickety stage of The Rat, known for its malfunctioning bathrooms, graffiti-covered walls, beer-soaked floors, and yes, live rats. The club also hosted hundreds of homegrown bands including The Cars. Advertisement RELATED: Fenway’s changing profile to claim landmark HoJo’s Advertisement “It’s all coming back,” Samuels said at a recent walk-through at the motel, slated to open next month. “If you didn’t live through it, you’ll like it.” Brown, former general manager of the Four Seasons and mastermind behind Boston’s luxurious Mandarin Oriental, didn’t exactly sign up for this kind of challenge. He was accustomed to the top of Boston’s hotel world, not the bottom. HoJo’s, he likes to remind everyone, was No. 74 on TripAdvisor’s ranking of places to stay. Samuels and his partners, which include Weiner Ventures, have spent the past seven months  and well over $10 million overhauling the HoJo on Boylston Street. Each room features custom furniture and cheeky touches such as ironing board covers that read “Some Like it Hot.” The old Hong Kong Cafe that was inside HoJo’s is no more. A new restaurant will open in the fall. The soon-to-open Verb hotel near Fenway Park uses vintage and funky objects that echo the area’s music heritage. Lane Turner/Globe Staff In the pricey Boston hotel market, HoJo’s was a popular alternative with average rates around $140 a night. Prices at The Verb — whose name comes from the audio term reverb — will hover in the mid-$200s. By Brown’s standards, that’s down market, but he is enjoying the lower altitude. “It’s a great relief,” he said. “I am having a lot more fun.” The easy thing to do would have been to give this motel, built as the Fenway Motor Lodge in 1959, a baseball theme. It sits in the shadow of Fenway Park, after all. Brown and Samuels knew they wanted to play off the kitschiness of a mid-century motel, reactivating the pool in the courtyard and stocking each room with typewriters bought off eBay. But something was missing, and Samuels found it in Cleveland. While visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, he spotted a 1972 Randy Newman song written on Fenway Motor stationery. “This is a message,” the developer thought to himself. Advertisement No kidding. Perhaps from the almighty himself. Newman’s “ God’s Song ” is considered one of his masterpieces, a brilliant work of satire released long before the songwriter went all commercial on us. Now, this wasn’t going to be a Hard Rock, a brand of rock-and-roll nostalgia that is as authentic as Milli Vanilli. So Samuels reached out to friend Stephen Mindich, the ex-publisher of the Boston Phoenix, to help him unpack the history of Fenway’s music scene. Imagine — old Phoenix front pages could be used as artwork on the walls to help tell the story. Rooms, which will cost in the mid-$200, are adorned with such retro decorations as manual typewriters and covers from the Phoenix weekly magazine. Lane Turner/Globe Staff/Globe Staff “I thought it was fabulous — and especially moving,” said Mindich, who had to abruptly shutter the alternative weekly last year after nearly half a century. Mindich brought in archivist David Bieber, another old hand from the Phoenix and a WBCN radio alum. Bieber said he has collected “hundreds of thousands” of pop cultural items, the bulk of them stored in climate-controlled warehouses. In other words, stuff itching to see the light of day. You’ll find memorabilia on the walls of The Verb that include a promo photo of eccentric Modern Lovers leader Jonathan Richman, backstage passes from the J. Geils Band, and torn $4.50 ticket stubs to a Blondie show at the Paradise on Commonwealth Avenue, one of the few original rock clubs still open. Crippled Youth at the Rathskeller in 1986. JJ Gonson Through Phoenix covers in the rooms, guests will get a cultural panorama of life in Boston dating to the ’60s. They’ll also see a grittier Fenway/Kenmore area, a place where Burger King and the Pizza Pad were considered gourmet restaurants, and punks and Sox fans sometimes brawled on the sidewalks. Today, you can shop at REI and West Elm, and you can grab sushi at Basho Japanese Brasserie and enjoy the raw bar at Island Creek Oyster, housed virtually on the same site as The Rathskeller, The Rat’s formal name. Advertisement The Fenway/Kenmore music scene on Lansdowne Street is not as loud and freewheeling as it once was. The scene has gone corporate with the House of Blues, and safe-bet baby-boomer favorites such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, and Paul McCartney play at Fenway Park. But The Verb, even with its sanitized version of the old punk scene, reminds us the neighborhood was once as much about bass lines as baseball.
