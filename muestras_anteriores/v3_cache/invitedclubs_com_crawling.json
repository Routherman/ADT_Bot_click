The new brand best positions it as a premier, family-first Club defined by unparalleled service and world-class amenities that will comprehensively reshape the Member experience. âAt Invited, we are dedicated to providing premier experiences for our members. The new Ardea Country Club stands as a testament to this commitment,â said Invited CEO David Pillsbury. âThe renovated North Course strikes a perfect balance between challenge and playability. With our enhanced dining, racquet sports facilities renovation and the introduction of childcare services, Ardea is solidifying its position as a premier, family-oriented Club.â The name Ardea pays homage to the beautiful marshlands and wildlife that are an essential part of the clubâs story, especially the iconic Blue Heron. âArdeaâ is the Latin genus for âheron,â delivering a fresh take for the clubâs time-honored mascot. Additionally, on November 10, the renovated restaurant, newly renamed to Heronâs Bar & Grille, will host its grand re-opening and ribbon cutting, along with the opening of the newly added Kidâs Club, Birdies. âThis project ultimately will transform the Club with an extensive reinvention touching every area and enhancing every amenity,â said  Aaron Lucas, General Manager at Ardea Country Club. âOur exceptional Members are the heart and soul of our Club, and we couldnât be more pleased to bring forward these spectacular improvements to keep their experience fresh and exciting.â The new Ardea features a host of renovations, including: A top-flight golf experience â The tee boxes and greens of the North golf course have been completely revamped, creating a world-class golf experience for Members and guests alike. The greens now feature best-in-class Tif-Eagle Ultradwarf Bermuda grass, considered the gold standard for turf at the finest clubs in the country, while the tees now feature laser-leveled turf. Additionally, the irrigation system for the North Course has been completely upgraded and overhauled, while a redesigned short game area will ensure Members are ready for their rounds. Fresh culinary experiences â Ardeaâs dining room, renamed to Heronâs Bar and Grille, has been expanded and fashioned into a reimagined, modern dining experience. There are now alfresco, outside dining experiences allowing Members and guests to enjoy the Florida sunshine, while updates to the facilityâs private event spaces can accommodate any gathering. Member-focused Club renovations â The newly completed Kidâs Club, Birdies, located conveniently in the main clubhouse next to the fitness and dining areas, will provide an engaging space for families. There also will be a new slate of robust family and kids programming to better engage and serve Members. Premier racquet sports experience â Coming in 2024, the tennis facilities at Ardea will be renovated to usher in a new chapter for racquet sports at the club. Updated landscaping and new gathering areas will be inviting for Members, while new LED outdoor lighting will enhance the areaâs aesthetics. Additionally, there will be a host of renovations and improvements to the Clubâs clay courts.
