The drinks and food were great and my team enjoyed the experience and attention to details.If you are in a need of a space for a company event, Cherish will make sure it is a flawless experience. - Janelle S.

(MIA) My friends and I visited Blue Martini two weekends ago during my bachelorette weekend. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, we ended up staying the whole night. The environment and music were great too! Will definitely be coming back here anytime I’m in Miami. Thank you for the amazing hospitality - A soon to be bride and her Texas girls - Maria V. (MIA) We randomly stumbled in here and had a great time. We had a party of 15 and were able to get drinks immediately. We didn’t think we would stay so we didn’t do bottle service, then we ended up staying 3 hours and did it anyway.  The DJ was killing it! He played every genre and a little something for everyone. - Angeli P. (MIA) Blue Martini Brickell was recently remodeled and just reopened not too long ago. This classy venue is on track to become a top night life destination in Miami with it's impressive world-class sound system and service for the elite and chic crowd. - 305 Luigi (MIA) Previous Next Questions?

We have delivered market leading events to the Irish market for many years and we have expanded our operations into the UK. We have partnered with well established and experienced companies who bring with them a proven track record, and have worked with us over the previous years and who value our passion, dedication and commitment to delivering the best possible events for our clients.\n\nSeasonal Ice Rinks are a very well established business in the UK and on the continent but the concept is a relatively new one in Ireland. Seasonal rinks tend to operate for between 8 and 12 weeks each season. The most successful rinks operate in areas of high footfall such as shopping centres, town centres and tourist attractions. Many shopping centre operators use ice rinks as a seasonal attraction and part of the Christmas activity or point of difference.

Las V Instagram View this profile on Instagram Reviews My company hosted a team happy hour here with the help of their Events Manager Cherish. It was a great experience from beginning to end!I have not been here in a few years and was very impressed with the upgrades made. The drinks and food were great and my team enjoyed the experience and attention to details.If you are in a need of a space for a company event, Cherish will make sure it is a flawless experience. - Janelle S. (MIA) This is a great event venue! Cherish, the events manager, was amazing. She helped plan and host my business launch party. Planning the event was so easy and fun and the event went better than I could’ve hoped. Highly recommend booking your events here! - Salma M. (MIA) My friends and I visited Blue Martini two weekends ago during my bachelorette weekend. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, we ended up staying the whole night. The environment and music were great too! Will definitely be coming back here anytime I’m in Miami. Thank you for the amazing hospitality - A soon to be bride and her Texas girls - Maria V. (MIA) We randomly stumbled in here and had a great time. We had a party of 15 and were able to get drinks immediately. We didn’t think we would stay so we didn’t do bottle service, then we ended up staying 3 hours and did it anyway.  The DJ was killing it! He played every genre and a little something for everyone. - Angeli P. (MIA) Blue Martini Brickell was recently remodeled and just reopened not too long ago. This classy venue is on track to become a top night life destination in Miami with it's impressive world-class sound system and service for the elite and chic crowd. - 305 Luigi (MIA) Previous Next Questions?
