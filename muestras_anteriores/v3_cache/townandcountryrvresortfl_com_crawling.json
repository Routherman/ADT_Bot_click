All three ratings categories are measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Less than 1 percent of parks or campgrounds receive the coveted 10 | 10 | 10 rating, which indicates superior facilities that are well maintained, clean, well-appointed restrooms and a highly appealing appearance. Campgrounds are inspected annually by dedicated RVers like you. Completeness of facilities 10 10 10 The first campground rating evaluates completeness and quality of facilities. In this category we rate interior roads, sites, registration area, hookups, recreation, swimming, security, laundry, store and building maintenance. Cleanliness of restrooms and showers 10 10 10 The second rating category concerns the cleanliness and physical characteristics of toilets, walls, showers, sinks/counters/mirrors and floor. If a park achieves a full point in each of the above, it receives a star ( ), indicating exceptionally clean restrooms. Also rated are physical characteristics of restrooms, including interior construction, adequate supplies/odor free, adequate number of facilities, exterior appearance and location in relation to park spaces, and interior appearance. Visual appeal and environmental quality 10 10 10 This category addresses the park's setting and site layout, function and identification of signage, overall exterior building maintenance, noise, trash disposal, litter and debris around the grounds and sites, and appearance of grounds, sites and entrance area.

We live in our permanent home in an RV park in Zephyrhills we will be selling after having left California living there for half our lives, 30 yrs. We visited a yr ago and spoke to one of the handful of permanent residents who was very friendly and told us the owner had purchased a few homes from people who were unable to sell and perhaps he would rent out short term. A yr later we were coming back to look and today we would have been inquiring w the office. When we drove in, immediately there was a man in a white van following us. My husband pulled to the side. The man pulled up to our window scrutinizing us and asking what our business was. We proceeded to relay the above. He had tools galore in his van. He did not identify himself so I assumed he was either a protective nosy resident or a really protective maintenance man w his van and tools. He repeatedly said, in the brief 3 minute encounter, this place was seasonal. We said we were looking for seasonal (we will be transitioning w a 5th wheel). He proceeded to slowly leave to the end of the park. We sat there until he disappeared and proceeded to go down a few streets to view park like we did a yr ago. On our way out, we saw a man on a golf cart talking to a permanent resident at her home. We decided to stop and be polite. Much to our surprise it was now the same man on the golf cart. I asked what time office was open tomorrow, realizing mid sentence this was the same man. He proceeded with his negativity once more. Finally, out of frustration, but politely I asked him if he was the maintenance man. That was when he finally identified himself, showing his true colors in the process, saying he was the \"OWNER and HE WANTED US OUT OF HERE AND I DONT WANT YOU iN HERE\". Our jaws dropped along w the resident and we were stunned speechless. I am the daughter of a USAF pilot. My dad was a Christian, a righteous man and a man of noble character and inscrutable integrity. I later felt if he were there and heard this man talk to me and my husband, he would have decked him just once and laid him out for a good few hours. The only thing I can figure is that my husband of 33 yrs is of Hispanic descent and he doesn't want anyone who looks like him in his park. I cannot remember the last time, I or we were ever spoken to so nastily. He is a rude, nasty man who has probably spent a lifetime of inflicting his nastiness on whomever he deems his latest victims. I believe his caginess in never identifying himself was all about cleverly trying to discourage us from inquiring about a seasonal stay because of the color of my husband's skin. So, vacationer, snow bird, buyer of a park model 4 sale in there, BEWARE! This man is UNHINGED. He is either a RACIST, UNHINGED or BOTH. Thank GOD, we found out prior to a background check at the office with our flying colors credit scores, no criminal records ever, no evictions ever and history of always making our rent and bill payments on time for decades. Vic Newbold October 16, 2023 The male senior owner has issues that involve yelling at people and threatening them. I spent 1. And 1/2 winters but left as I did not feel safe there when he went off on me. I didn't know ihe was stable or if he would become more violent. His wife Mary was well aware of his outbursts P Stickney May 23, 2023 After four physical visits and numerous telephone calls, which were call forwarded an 813 area code, went to a recording saying that the mailbox was full, we have yet been able to get in touch with Mary. On our first visit the office was locked so we asked a man doing  some work there and he left her a note to call me. On our last visit the same man told me that this is not a trailer park it's an RV resort. Ok I'm using a RV he then said that that they don't rent out to RV people in the summer. Huh?. Something is , in my opinion, really weird going on here. We have been RV enthusiastic  people for 50 years and I can honestly say I have never encountered a stranger situation.  Totally surprised that they can maintain a business Carol Wotring November 30, 2021 Nice people. Unfortunately we haven't been able to get for a few years.
