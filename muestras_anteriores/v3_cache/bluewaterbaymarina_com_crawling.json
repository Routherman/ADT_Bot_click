WEDDING INFO A Little Of Our history Shed 3 Dockside Restaurant & Bar was established in 1991 in this historic wooden building known as Shed 3. The history of our beautiful building dates back to 1887 and is now listed as a heritage site by Wellington City Council. It is one of the oldest examples of a building fundamental to operating Wellington’s wharves. Originally a single-storey warehouse, a second storey was added in the 20th century for Harbour Board tug boat staff. Timber buildings like this one once lined the wharves and jetties between Taranaki Street and Pipitea Wharf. Now, Shed 3 is one of the last remaining few. Testimonials “ I visited Dockside during my holiday from the UK and was amazed by the quality of the produce and service from the attentive staff.
