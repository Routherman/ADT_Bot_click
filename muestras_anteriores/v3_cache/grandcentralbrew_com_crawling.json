When you come to The Canadian Brewhouse, you’ll feel like you’re right at home, because Our House is Your House…only we have way more TVs! That’s right, you won’t find a better selection of screens for watching the sports you love anywhere else! We even provide tabletop speakers for those nights when multiple sports and teams are playing.​ Founder: Roger Newton How it all happened... 2002 An Edmonton boys' dream turned reality.  Roger Newton purchased an old pool hall in the west end of Edmonton, with a clear vision of what was missing from the city of champions.  There were Irish Bars, English Pubs, and even Belgian Cafes, but there was nothing that truly honoured the rich heritage of Canada.  Combine that with his love of Sports, Roger opened the first ever Canadiana Sports Bar in West Edmonton, The Canadian Brewhouse.  This location has since closed, but it was the start of a service industry giant. 2007 It takes time, passion, and persistence in order to grow a single restaurant into a nationally recognized brand.  In 2007, The Canadian Brewhouse leadership realized that they had the opportunity to do just that.  They took over another bar in North Edmonton and worked tirelessly to renovate it and turn it into a Canadian Brewhouse in just 30 days. 2009 In anticipation of the pending growth in South Edmonton and the expansion of Anthony Henday Drive, CBH opened up store number 3.  This was the first CBH designed and built-out from the ground up.  You can still see some of the same concepts and features in our newest locations as you can here, such as large vaulted ceilings, a second floor, and a jumbo score clock overtop of the main bar. 2010 Our first foray into a market that wasn't Edmonton.  Granted, Sherwood Park is like Edmonton's super cool neighbour who always brings beers to a barbecue.  This location has been the go-to sports bar in Sherwood Park ever since we opened our doors.  Here, we recently underwent a renovation to add another 100+ seats to accommodate the massive amounts of local sports teams who host fundraisers and team events at the location. 2011 Grande Prairie opens up to an excited city ready to watch some sports! 2012 This was the year we really started to take off and opened up 4 stores around Alberta! Downtown Edmonton, Camrose, Lloydminster, and Spruce Grove all opened up in the same year. 2013 Red Deer and Calgary Harvest Hills opened their doors. 2014 Leduc, Fort McMurray, and Saskatoon opened their doors. 2015 Airdrie, Okotoks, Regina Grasslands, Kelowna, and Fort Saskatchewan all opened their doors this year. 2016 Winnipeg, Regina Eastgate, Abbotsford and Moose Jaw all opened. 2017 Cochrane, Prince George, Fort St. John, Richmond, Calgary Mahogany, Chestermere and St. Albert South all opened their doors. 2018 St. Albert Jensen Lakes and Edmonton Lewis Estates opened their doors. 2019 Calgary Northgate, Saskatoon West and Edmonton Windermere opened. 2020 One of our most anticipated locations opened its doors in Lethbridge in 2020. This Brewhouse is the first one to feature something no other Brewhouse has ever had before; a full-sized bowling alley in the basement! That means you can choose from bowling in the basement, restaurant/bar on the main level, and rooftop patio! 2021 Our newest location in the Edmonton International Airport was cleared for takeoff, featuring pre and post-security seating! We also took a huge leap into the Ontario market with new locations in Oshawa and Barrie. Finally, we opened our 7th Edmonton location in Manning and our 5th location in Calgary in the Township district. 2022 More brand-spankin’ new locations popped up all over the country! We opened our doors in London, Ontario, the University District in Calgary (featuring a massive two-story patio!), Victoria (featuring a batting cage and bowling alley!) and Banff, Alberta. We also opened The Canadian Icehouse in Edmonton's ICE District, a one-of-a-kind elevated sports bar and lounge with the largest rooftop patio in Western Canada! 2024 2024 was another year of growth! We opened our new Kamloops location in August, and our Kitchener location in September. More to come in 2025! 2025 We started 2025 strong, opening our new Mississauga location in January — and we’ve kept the momentum going. In May, we proudly opened our 47th and 48th locations in Prince Albert and Windsor. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to grow!

Blending their backgrounds into something unexpected, this group brings a fresh take on jazz with familiar faces in less familiar territory. Catch them live and see what happens when musicians push past the edges of their genre. 11 0 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 17999308943656733 11 0 Our latest collaboration with @pointybelbrew, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing.

The Brewhouse has copper serving kegs that are popular in Prague and other European cities, pulley fans that resemble those Milkey saw at an old bar in New York City, and a Bavarian-style beer garden. “There are so many influences here that came from my travels with my wife Jeanne. Some of it was before I thought about starting a brewery and some since I had the idea, even when construction was ongoing. I wanted to create a brewery that had what I thought were all the best features I liked,” Milkey, founder and CEO, told the St. Pete Catalyst . The Catalyst got a sneak peek as Grand Central Brewhouse, at 2324 Central Ave., prepares for its grand opening this weekend, just over a year after groundbreaking . Milkey has invested about $5 million in the project, which includes two newly constructed buildings totaling more than 10,000 square feet on land he acquired about two years ago. Place Architecture was the architect on the project and Boyd Construction handled the buildout. The site previously was home to Taco Bus and long before that, a Cadillac dealership. Grand Central Brewhouse occupies the building on the right. LaLa St. Pete, a restaurant, will occupy the building on the left. The Brewhouse not only adds to the flourishing activity in the Grand Central District, but also will have an economic impact. Milkey has hired 22 people — a dozen full-time and 10 part-time — nearly all of whom had lost their jobs or had their hours cut when other local restaurants and breweries limited their operations due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, Milkey, a retired insurance executive and philanthropist, will donate 10 percent of the sales of selected beers to nonprofit organizations. Related: Why this philanthropist gives back to St. Pete “We will always have three beers on tap that are charity beers. It’s part of our ‘Brew Good’ program. Ten percent of sales from these  beers will go to three local nonprofits,” Milkey said. “You buy a $6 beer and 60 cents is going to charity.” Tampa Bay Watch, dedicated to the preservation and restoration of the Tampa Bay estuary, will receive 10 percent of the sales from the beer of the day on a permanent basis. Milkey and his family are long-time supporters of Tampa Bay Watch. The other two nonprofits will rotate monthly, with Milkey selecting one and the Brewhouse staff selecting the other. Initially, Daystar Life Center and The Manners House are the other recipients. Lagers and ales The brewery is a 10-barrel system, equivalent to 20 kegs of beer for each brewing cycle. The brewery at Grand Central Brewhouse “We have four fermenters. We can we brew four beers four days in a row and put them in the four fermenters, where they have to stay for at least 10 days and often 14 days. Then we can do another batch,” Milkey said. The head brewer is Tyler Singletary, a veteran of the local craft brewing industry. The Brewhouse will have both lagers — which tend to have a crisper, cleaner taste, according to Tapville — and ales, which are more full-bodied and sweeter. “I told Tyler I wanted more lagers, the more easy-drinking, traditional style of beer that most people like. It’s hot in Florida and people want something that’s smoother and crisp. But we’ll have a full spectrum of beers, a few IPAs, every shade of ale, in addition to the lagers,” Milkey said. A unique feature at the Brewhouse are the copper serving tanks. Copper serving tanks over the first floor bar While they are popular in Europe, they are made by a company in Missouri, from which Milkey ordered them. The copper tanks keep beer fresher because there’s no need to add carbon dioxide as the beer gets lower in the tank. The brewhouse features an observation window on the second floor so guests can watch the brewing process in action. The brewery as seen from the second floor observation window. There’s also a laboratory. “We take quality extremely seriously. To make sure you are measuring quality right, you need a lab,” Milkey said. The laboratory The Brewhouse also will offer four wines on tap – two reds and two whites – and free self-serve purified sparkling and still water. Milkey expects to add coffee later. Safety steps Inside the Brewhouse, there’s an industrial feel, with steel and brick and concrete floors. Windows facing Central Avenue are actually doors that open up, similar to a garage door. Windows facing Central Avenue can be opened like garage doors The upstairs, including an outside terrace, feels more like a lounge. Milkey expects it to be a popular spot for private parties. The second floor of Grand Central Brewhouse A counter facing Central Avenue on the second floor is one of Milkey’s favorite spot in the Brewhouse. View of Central Avenue from the second floor The beer garden includes lots of seating, with room for bocce ball and cornhole games. Milkey plans to show movies and sports on a screen painted on the eastern wall. The beer garden includes an olive tree to provide shade. The walls facing the beer garden feature murals by local artist Carrie Jadus and are among the several murals at the Brewhouse. The mural on the outside west wall was painted by Jabari Reed, who goes by iBombs, and was created as part of the SHINE Mural Festival to depict the impact of red tide on the ocean. Mural by Jabari Reed, aka iBomb The Brewhouse has a total capacity of 600, most of that outside in the beer garden and upstairs terrace. When it opens, and through the pandemic, Milkey said he will limit the amount of people to no more than 50 percent of capacity. All employees wear masks, there are lots of hand sanitizer stations and a professional crew will come in nightly to clean and sanitize. The Brewhouse is in the western part of the two-building project. LaLa Karaoke Box, or LaLa St. Pete, will occupy the eastern half of the site . The restaurant concept features high-end pub food with a French twist and seven private karaoke rooms. When it opens in May, it will provide food to Grand Central Brewhouse. Until then, Milkey plans to bring some food trucks to the Brewhouse occasionally, in partnership with his neighbor, The Dog Bar, and guests can bring in their own food. “If they don’t have food they are here for one or two drinks and then they need to go get something to eat,” Milkey said. “If they have food they stay.” Still to come are solar panels on the roof of the Brewhouse that will take care of 40 percent to 50 percent of its electric needs, Milkey said.

This isn’t just a place to drink; it’s where local flavors, lively conversations, and carefully curated vibes all come together. The taproom’s laid-back yet vibrant atmosphere is the perfect setting to enjoy their exceptional craft beers. From crisp lagers to hoppy IPAs, there’s something on tap to suit every palate. The real magic happens when you pair these craft beers with the thoughtfully crafted dishes available at the taproom. Whether you’re craving light bites or something more substantial, the food and craft beer pairing options are designed to elevate your tasting experience. For instance, try pairing their signature IPA with spicy chicken wings — a match that brings out the bold flavors in both the dish and the craft beer. If you prefer something richer, opt for a stout, which pairs beautifully with a meat & cheese board. The taproom staff are always ready with recommendations, guiding you toward the perfect pairing that suits your taste. Each visit to this taproom offers something new to discover, whether you’re a seasoned beer lover or a casual sipper. Beyond the craft beer and food, it’s the taproom environment itself that makes Grand Central Brewhouse special. It’s a space where the community gathers, friendships form, and memories are made—all while enjoying the finest craft beer St. Pete has to offer. For an experience that blends flavor, learning, and connection, visit the taproom at Grand Central Brewhouse. Here, you’ll find that great craft beer is just the beginning.

If you haven’t heard of them before, they are a jazz project featuring members of well-known Tampa Bay bands stepping outside their usual sound. Blending their backgrounds into something unexpected, this group brings a fresh take on jazz with familiar faces in less familiar territory. Catch them live and see what happens when musicians push past the edges of their genre. 11 0 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 17999308943656733 11 0 Our latest collaboration with @pointybelbrew, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing.

His passion and expertise drive the success of our craft beer brewery. After retiring from a successful career in insurance, Kevin has decided to take his talents to the craft beer industry. Exactly what those talents are remains debatable. But what is not debatable is his love of beer and spending time at craft breweries. Prior to establishing Grand Central Brewhouse, Kevin was one of the three original employees at American Strategic Insurance, more commonly known as ASI, a property insurance company based in St. Petersburg. After 21 years at ASI and following the acquisition of ASI by Progressive Insurance Group, Kevin retired from ASI. But long before he retired, he dreamt of owning a craft brewery someday. Kevin was an early enthusiast of craft beers, long before most people had heard of craft beers or microbrews. Before any craft breweries opened locally, Kevin regularly stopped into Shep’s on Fourth Street to pick up new craft beer to sample from around the country. Kevin, his wife Jeanne, and son Jack love to travel and craft breweries, pubs, beer halls, and beer tours became a significant part of the itinerary wherever they traveled in both the U.S. and Europe. The laid-back environment and large variety of innovative beers at craft breweries presented the ideal combination to spend quality time. In recent years, the brewery stops have become “research” trips. Kevin has incorporated many ideas from breweries and pubs from around the world into his vision for Grand Central Brewhouse, most notably serving beer directly from serving tanks. Kevin has also completed the Brewing Arts Program offered by USF St. Petersburg where he not only learned how to brew beer but gained foundational knowledge of owning and operating a brewery. Kevin moved to Florida from New York City in 1991 and quickly fell in love with the Tampa Bay area. Away from the brewery, Kevin is very active in the community, sitting on two charitable boards and supporting several local non-profits through the Milkey Family Foundation he established with Jeanne to support local charities in the St. Petersburg area. He is a huge sports fan and enthusiastically supports our Tampa Bay professional teams. An avid runner, Kevin has completed 11 marathons, which helps complement his other passion, beer. return to news Join us on Sunday, September 7 at 5 PM when The Sundaes take the stage for a Sunday night set you won’t want to miss.

Blending their backgrounds into something unexpected, this group brings a fresh take on jazz with familiar faces in less familiar territory. Catch them live and see what happens when musicians push past the edges of their genre. 11 0 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 17999308943656733 11 0 Our latest collaboration with @pointybelbrew, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing.

Whether you’re in the mood for something light and refreshing, rich and malty, or bold and hoppy, our taproom has the perfect brew for you. Light & Crisp Experience the refreshing taste of our light and crisp craft beers, perfect for those who prefer subtle flavors. These beers offer a clean finish and pair wonderfully with a sunny afternoon at Grand Central Brewhouse. St. Petian American Pale Lager IBU: 12\tABV: 4.7% The St. Petian American Pale Lager was made with every citizen of St. Pete in mind. This light, easy-drinking lager is perfect for a day with the Rays or a day in the rays. Also, if you’re strictly a “Macro Guy,” look no further, just order a Bud and we’ll bring you this instead. Peninsular pils IBU: 35\tABV: 5.1% Peninsular is a German-style Pilsner brewed with German grown barley and three different Germanhops: Tettnanger, Mittlefüh and Hersbrucker. It’s crisp, refreshing and uncomplicated, each sip naturally leading to the next. We brewed it to be that catalyst for inspired conversation. Rice Rice Baby Rice Lager IBU: 12\tABV: 4.5% Our latest collaboration with Point Ybel Brewing, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. “Elevator Pitch” Munich Helles IBU: 20\tABV: 5.0% Maybe you’ve been in a situation where you’ve got to sell yourself or sell an idea to someone quickly and simply. That’s how we feel about this beer. Sometimes simple is a surprisingly difficult thing to pull off. It takes finesse and you gotta stick the landing. Grainy honey-like flavor with restrained hop character. This is our pitch to you a classic Munich Helles. Leave Me Cologne Kolsch IBU: 27\tABV 5.5% Leave Me Cologne pays homage to the classic beers of Köln. Kölsch is the ultimate gateway beer, it’s crisp, clean, and refreshing. Light grainy malts lay the foundation, while subtle notes of pear, apple, and hints of floral and spice round things out. It finishes dry, delicate, and refreshing. Vandelay Industries Vienna Lager IBU: 25\tABV: 5.2% This amber lager is brewed with the double decoction method, giving it a full body and malty backbone. It features notes of toffee and caramel with a very mild bitterness.  So, whether you are importing or exporting, you’ll want to put an order in for this one. Nada Piñata Mexican Lager IBU: 19\tABV: 5.4% Our Mexican Lager is ready to party. This style of beer can be interpreted in various ways using different ingredients and brewing methods. But the key to a Mexican Lager will always be drinkability. Ours uses flaked maize to enhance the crispness and deliver a refreshing fiesta straight into your mouth. Order a pitcher-full, trust us. Take the Connoli Italian Pilsner IBU: 30 \tABV: 5.2% I’m gonna make you an offer you can’t refuse. This Pilsner is crisp, clean and crushable. Pleasant bitterness comes from late additions of Hallertau Mittlefruh and Saphir hops. A dry finish that begs for another sip. As the old saying goes, “Revenge is a Pils Best Served Cold.” Passive Income Light Lager IBU: 10\tABV: 5.1% Passive Income is our latest light lager brewed with German Saphir hops, known for subtle fruity and spicy notes alongside punchy citrus aromas, and New Zealand Nelson Sauvin hops bringing white wine and gooseberry into the mix. Sounds weird? Well, it forms up like Voltron. Malty For those who love rich, full-flavored craft beers, our malty selections are a treat. Expect deep caramel notes and toasty profiles that warm the soul, making them a favorite at Grand Central Brewhouse. I Would Walk 500 Mild American Mild Ale IBU: 20\tABV: 5.0% Our Mild Ale is an American version of the classic British style. This malt-forward brew has notes of caramel and toast with a light-medium body and deceitfully dry finish. It pairs well with most foods and looks beautiful in the glass. This is the kind of beer you’d walk far for, like really far, just to be the one who walked a thousand miles to fall down at this bar. Slappin’ Da Bass Altbier IBU: 38\tBV: 4.7% Our German-Style Altbier starts with a single-decoction mash. So, what do we do for, like, seven straight hours during a long decoction? Hang out, shoot the shit, and slap da bass. Not like fast-paced rock. More like the Holy Triumvirate. This beer features mild notes of caramel/toffee and some spiciness from three different types of rye. Are you ready to get your world rocked? Harlon Pepper’s Honey Nut Brown Lager IBU: 20\tABV: 5.0% This malt-forward lager has notes of nuts, bread crusts, and mild roast, all imparted by the thoughtfully selected blend of grains. Months of conditioning result in that crisp, clean lager finish that will keep you coming back for more even if you can’t name every nut that there was. Upgrayedd Doppelbock IBU: 20\tABV: 7.4% Note: 2 d’s are for a double dose of pimpin’ and this Double-Bock has all the right moves. Silky and rich, this malt-forward lager will make you take notice, and if you don’t try one, Upgrayedd is gonna come looking for you. If You Can Dodge A Wrench Baltic Porter IBU: 38\tABV: 6.9% Also known as an Imperial Porter, this beer is similar in flavor to the ale variety but is brewed with lager yeast and cold conditioned. It’s made exclusively with the tears of Globo Gym jocks and chock full of rich chocolate malt flavors with slight alcohol warmth and fruity esters. Dark & Roasty If you crave deep, complex flavors, our dark and roasty craft beers are a must-try. These bold brews are perfect for cooler evenings at Grand Central Brewhouse. Duckin’ Punches Irish Dry Stout IBU: 30\tABV:4.5% It’s that time of year where the Florida sunshine we all love can start to feel oppressive, like an uppercut of sunbeams, so we brewed a summer-time stout. Introducing “Duckin’ Punches.” Light body, dry finish and remarkably smooth. None More Black Schwarzbier (black lager) IBU: 28\tABV: 4.2% This Black Lager drinks just like its’ lighter cousin, but this dark soul has roasted malt flavors with a light body and dry, roasty finish. It’s, like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is: None. None more black. Al Czervik Czech Dark Lager IBU: 26\tABV:5.5% This Tmavé, or Czech Dark Lager, is brewed with a triple decoction to create a rich, malty backbone. It has mild roasty characters balanced by dark, dried fruity esters for a flavor that falls in between a Munich Dunkel and a Schwarzbier. “So what? So let’s dance!” HOPPY These brews shine during our lively music nights, where the atmosphere is as vibrant as the beer. Our hoppy selections are for true hop enthusiasts, offering intense aromas and flavors. Enjoy these lively craft beers at Grand Central Brewhouse during taproom events. Leg Day IPA IBU: 50\tABV: 7.0% Leg Day IPA is brewed in collaboration with the Tampa Bay Rowdies, inspired by their relentless energy on the field. This medium-bodied, hop-forward IPA showcases Strata and Citra hops, delivering a dynamic blend of berry sweetness, strawberry, and a ripe citrus kick. Bold and flavorful yet smooth on the palate, this beer is crafted for those who give it their all—on the field or in the stands. After all, every victory deserves a proper pint. “Glitter Wizard” HAzy pale Ale IBU: 0\tABV: 5.0% Glitter Wizard is a Hazy Pale Ale brewed with summer in mind. This one features Mosaic Spectrum in the dry hop, a cutting-edge flowable hop extract from Barth Haas that captures the full intensity of Mosaic without the excess vegetal matter. Layered on top is Krush, a hop variety known for its lush notes of mango, guava, and ripe citrus. The result is a vibrant, aromatic pale ale that brings plenty of flavor without overwhelming the palate. “Daytime Diablo” Hazy IPA IBU: 35 ABV:6.0% Daytime Diablo is brewed with El Dorado and Nelson hops for a vibrant mix of tropical fruit, white grape, and a hint of dank resin. Smooth, juicy, and just the right amount of mischievous, it’s the perfect pour for patio weather. Golden Gaze New Zealand-style HAzy IPA IBU: 0\tABV: 7.0% Golden Gaze is our latest New Zealand-style Hazy IPA, brewed with a trio of Riwaka, Citra, and Motueka hops. Expect waves of citrus zest, sun-ripened tropical fruit, and a soft, pillowy mouthfeel that glides across the palate. It’s vibrant without being bitter, layered without being heavy, and finishes clean with just enough lingering hop presence to keep your attention until the next sip. California Sober West Coast IPA IBU: 40\tABV: 7.3% Brewed in collaboration with Clearwater Brewing, set to reopen in August 2025 under new ownership and a seasoned brewing team we’ve known and respected for years. This West Coast IPA features Riverbend Pilsner malt and a classic trio of Simcoe, Centennial, and Cascade hops. It delivers layered notes of pine, citrus, and light resin with a dry, crisp finish. Seasonal Specials Celebrate the seasons with our rotating lineup of seasonal craft beers. From spiced autumn ales to refreshing summer wheat beers, Grand Central Brewhouse always has something new on tap. Airing of Grievances German Festbier IBU: 30\tABV: 6.3% This beer has a medium to light body with a pronounced bitterness and noble-hop aromatics. It’s Oktoberfestivus for the rest of us! Just hoisting this bad boy to your mouth is a feat of strength, but your efforts will be rewarded. Your Mom Goes to Marzen Oktoberfest/Marzen IBU: 22\tABV:6.2% This deep amber lager is rich in malt with a balance of clean, hop bitterness.  Originating in Germany, this style was traditionally brewed in the spring (“Marzen” meaning “March”) and aged, or lagered, throughout the summer.   Whether you are unwinding after a day of selling boondoggle keychains to pay for college, or just chillin’ with friends listening to an oompah band, this is the beer for you. Join us on Sunday, September 7 at 5 PM when The Sundaes take the stage for a Sunday night set you won’t want to miss.

If you haven’t heard of them before, they are a jazz project featuring members of well-known Tampa Bay bands stepping outside their usual sound.

Catch them live and see what happens when musicians push past the edges of their genre. 11 0 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 17999308943656733 11 0 Our latest collaboration with @pointybelbrew, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing. Stop by and grab a glass! 33 2 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 18057786497113047 33 2 On Sunday, August 31 at 2 PM The Fernando Cruz Trio returns to Grand Central Brewhouse for an afternoon of rich, expressive jazz led by saxophonist, composer, and educator Fernando Cruz.

Larry was instructive, knowledgeable and patient with our group who demonstrated no skills in this new living hobby. There's much more to learn if we want to expand beyond one growing Jade plant, but I'm looking forward to more of Larry's good talents. carmen stockton 15:18 04 Dec 24 It was a great time…. Learned a lot and would love to do it again!!! Very nice teachers!! Errol Stewart 05:00 27 Nov 24 Man, those guys gave an incredibly well laid out, informative and hands on presentation presentation covering Bonsai.  All of their folks were knowledgeable and knew how to interact with folks who didn't really have a clue...  If you are considering dabbling in bonsai plant, I highly recommend one of their courses... Misty Heath 22:18 27 Apr 24 The venue was great. The instructor very knowledgeable and walked us through styling our bonsai. We had a great time. Leonard Mencio 15:30 24 Apr 24 What a great Birthday gift by my wife! She registered us last weekend with Thunderstruck Bonsai’s ,“Bonsai and Brews Event” for my Birthday, and we had a phenomenal time. Owner and Operators, Larry and Justine made the session of learning different aspects of bonsai creations so much fun. Both Larry and Justine are very approachable, friendly and a wealth of information. We got to pick our own tree, and pot to work on, while all the tools and materials were provided and ready when we got there. There was a short and extremely informative basic bonsai class with Larry and Justine (he was the artist, sort-of, lol), before working on our bonsai. Although given creative freedom, they both were great at getting around to everyone, coaching your pruning and designs, potting and wiring, if needed. When it’s all done… you have learned some of the basics, have a gentle grasp of bonsai designs, and best of all… you take your bonsai home! Loved this event, and we highly recommend this for any occasion! Great event, great guys and loads of fun… yes, the drinks were really good! A+ Chris Lay 10:38 19 Apr 24 Very enjoyable and informative evening.  Thanks!!!! Tiffany Potter 17:16 18 Apr 24 Did the Bonsai class at Caledonia Brewing last night. A lot of fun! Selection of trees and pots was great. Instructions were easy to follow and instructors were amazing. Highly recommend. Can't wait to see how my Bonsai progresses Stephanie Andreassen 17:15 18 Apr 24 Great beginner workshop! Learned a lot and can’t wait to see how my new bonsai comes along! Greg Daloiso 20:49 03 Apr 24 My wife and I had a great time and learned a lot. Would definitely do it again Denise Leider 20:45 23 Mar 24 Lot's of fun. Very knowledgeable instructor and they gave much needed assistance. Great atmosphere at Keel & Curley Winery too. Shannon Wagner 00:55 21 Mar 24 Annemarie Schriever 20:25 20 Mar 24 This was such a an amazing experience!! So glad we did it. Wasn't relaxing and fun. Everyone is very nice! Melanie “Melanie Ann” Rhoades 22:18 19 Mar 24 My husband, and I decided to sign up and see what's this is all about. Thinking it's a quick here do this and move on. It was so much more and so fun. We got instructions on the different shapes and the different types of care to preform (with a follow up email with added reminders for care and upkeep). We got to pick from a variety of pots and were shown how to start and how to cut the plants! I will say I loved this and it was worth every penny. Melissa Fuller 21:12 19 Mar 24 We attended a group class and had a great time! They went over history of the bonsai and different types of trees. We trimmed our own trees (with help when needed) and had a wonderful night. It was nice to go home with our own tree. Kristy Roberts 09:49 13 Mar 24 Such a great experience! We learned a lot. The workshop was very hands on and we had a bunch of help. I’m excited to see how my tree turns out. Kim Markgraf 05:07 08 Mar 24 We had so much fun with the bonsai and brews event put on by Larry! It was a super informative experience, and was so cool to learn the process and create something that we can keep up at home! I highly recommend it for a group event or date night out! Stacey Keys 00:22 27 Feb 24 Seminar was fun and the location at Bonsai Beverage was a perfect location Deena Murphy 18:59 22 Feb 24 Great experience! The instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful with teaching us about Bonsai techniques. Can’t wait to see how my tree evolves over time. Tania 19:31 20 Feb 24 The 2 hour Bonsai seminar with Bonsai, potting material, and a real ceramic pot all included at Beerbusters was fun! The teachers/owners were knowledgeable and helpful. I found a tree and pot I loved and which spoke to me. I can't wait to do more with my little tree. They even found me a few clippings to start some more trees on my own. They followed up with care instructions. I've yet to read the instructions but I hope they will remind of about how to clip, water, and feed them. I only wish it was a bit longer so I could learn about connect with my table mates! heather pfiel 05:14 20 Feb 24 Amazing class! Amazing teachers! I left this class feeling inspired, and with a profound appreciation for the art of bonsai. The passion transcends from teacher to student! Thank you so much! Highly recommend to any and all! What a great experience! Sally Frakes 13:15 18 Feb 24 Learned about the history of Bonsai and the Art of taking care of our precious species. Unique experience with Thunderstruck Bonsai. M. Keith Fox 11:32 18 Feb 24 Bonsai & Brews was a great introduction to the Bonsai way of growing an authentic piece of art. Larry and his assistant were fantastic with their one-on-one attention in a group class—a shout-out to 3 Daughters Brewery. Dana M 01:23 29 Jan 24 We had a great time and we learned so much!! Linda Gasser 22:26 23 Jan 24 My husband Lenny & I immensely enjoyed your recent session of Bonsai & Brews at 3 Daughters Brewpub at Clearwater Beach Thanks so much for doing these programs!  What a great idea & a great way to spread your love of this living & creative art to others! And, I expect I may have now begun a new hobby! We had such fun learning something new! I also appreciated the follow-up care guide you sent afterwards so our new bonsai trees will get off to a great start. Hope you keep these going & go to more places too! --Linda & Lenny  (NYS & Sandkey) Judith Taub 18:02 23 Jan 24 It was a really wonderful experience you learn a lot of information and bring home your own bonsai tree.

It was a nice date with my wife and she loved it!! We learned something new that day and appreciate this class so much. These dudes definitely are the real heroes. They are BONSAI tree legends!! Luke Herchenbach 13:34 26 Jul 22 Larry is amazing. I bought my first tree from him at a festival and just this past weekend I brought it back to him for confirmation that I’m not killing my plant, along with another bonsai I bought, that I am CERTAIN I was killing. He took the time to teach me how to prune my Jade and confirmed with me that my other plant isn’t dying. I was so impressed with his insights I ended up buying a second tree. This guy really knows what he is doing and I’m 100% looking forward to buying more trees from him in the future. Emily Stairs Abenchuchan 14:40 17 Jun 22 We went to the Bonsai and Brews at 3 Daughters last night and it was awesome! Larry is not only knowledgeable, he is kind. He had 2 assistants with him (Justin and I think his name was Kai?) who were also knowledgeable and kind. There was no concern about doing it \"wrong\", they gave support and gentle guidance and encouraged us to be creative and tell a story with our bonsai styles. Larry's passion for bonsai is contagious and he's got a real skill for showing the beauty of the art. 10/10 Faye Podlesney 01:42 20 May 22 What an incredibly beautiful display of bonsai. He was extremely knowledgeable and meticulous in his craft! We bought 4 bonsai from him and wanted to replant them in the proper season. He was kind enough to make sure we had all the proper equipment and walk us through each step.  I would highly recommend this business for any and all bonsai needs. HE ALSO DOES WORKSHOPS!!! How cool!!!! johnny cage 12:08 04 May 22 The guy really takes care of these trees, i bought a few bonsai trees for a gift for my mother's bday, a couple Barbados cherry bonsai trees and the one you seen in karate kid. She loved them, now she has some new additions to her garden. Stop by and take a look for yourself, you wont be disappointed. Drew Kate Sommers 13:16 16 Apr 22 Thunderstruck Bonsai is one of the best bonsai places we've ever visited. We were very impressed with the quality and variety of the trees, and how they are so well cared for. That's not always the case at the nurseries by us but it's obvious Larry knows what he's doing and is passionate about it.  He is a wealth of knowledge and patiently answered all our questions.  We went with the intention of just looking around (we live in IL and are here on vacation) and left with 2 beautiful trees that were very reasonably priced and my son is crazy about.

Blending their backgrounds into something unexpected, this group brings a fresh take on jazz with familiar faces in less familiar territory. Catch them live and see what happens when musicians push past the edges of their genre. 11 0 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 17999308943656733 11 0 Our latest collaboration with @pointybelbrew, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing. Stop by and grab a glass! 33 2 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 18057786497113047 33 2 On Sunday, August 31 at 2 PM The Fernando Cruz Trio returns to Grand Central Brewhouse for an afternoon of rich, expressive jazz led by saxophonist, composer, and educator Fernando Cruz.

The brewery is known for its quality lagers and ales, welcoming spaces, and engaging local events. History and Philosophy Located in St. Petersburg, Florida, Grand Central Brewhouse was established to foster community and craft high-quality beers. It operates on a philosophy of giving back, donating a portion of proceeds to local charities. The emphasis is on tradition and quality ingredients, ensuring that every beer honors its roots. The two-story establishment features a taproom and beer garden, making it an inviting space for all. Brewing Process and Techniques Grand Central Brewhouse takes pride in its meticulous brewing process. Using time-honored ingredients, the brewery offers a range of artisanal lagers. European serving tank technology ensures each beer’s distinct flavors are perfectly preserved from tank to glass. From golden and crisp to dark and malty, their beers cater to diverse tastes. The emphasis on quality is evident in every aspect, right down to the thoughtfully selected glassware. Location and Community Situated steps away from Central Avenue, the brewery provides an urban retreat with expansive indoor and outdoor spaces. The dog-friendly environment encourages bonding and memory-making among visitors. Food from LALA St. Pete complements the beer experience. The venue also offers options for private events, making it a versatile space for community gatherings. GCB’s origins stem from a simple love of beer and craft breweries.  After many years in the insurance business, Owner and Founder Kevin Milkey wanted to establish a new craft brewery in the community he feels very passionate about.  The initial plan was to follow the path of most US craft breweries and convert an old warehouse, gas station, garage, or factory into a brewery, but then Kevin came across a large vacant lot for sale on Central Avenue in the heart of the Grand Central District and thought that was a perfect location for a new brewery.   While discussing initial architectural plans with architect Tim Clemmons, we determined that the lot was big enough for two buildings, the second of which could be a restaurant which would provide food service for the brewery customers. So, what started out as an idea to renovate an old building into a small brewery became a new construction project with not one, but two buildings, each with a second floor and terrace and a large beer garden out back. Long before GCB opened, breweries and pubs were a frequent destination when\ntraveling. Many ideas incorporated into Grand Central Brewhouse came from\nvisits to breweries and pubs from around the world. The most notable being\nserving beer directly from serving tanks, which is more common in Europe\nthan in the US. The shiny copper serving tanks suspended above the main bar\nis the first thing your eyes are drawn to when entering GCB. In addition to\nthe design features of the brewery, our story is not complete without\nmentioning the emphasis of employees and giving back to the community. The\ngoal was to establish a new brewery with a focus on the employees, with an\nemphasis on fair pay, employee well-being and quality of life. Employees\nare the heart of any business, and it’s of utmost importance that everyone\nis treated fairly and with respect in a work environment where people are\nhappy at work. Lastly, sustainability and giving back to the community are\ningrained in our culture. Additional information about our community\ninitiatives and sustainability can be found in the Community section of\nthis website. OUR TEAM Inside Look: The Grand Central Brewhouse Story Grand Central Brewhouse (GCB) combines a passion for craft beer with innovative brewing techniques and community-focused initiatives. Discover how GCB’s collaborative team, mission-driven approach, commitment to sustainability, and strong code of conduct make it a standout in the craft beer industry. Kevin Milkey Founder and CEO After retiring from a successful career in insurance, Kevin has decided to take his talents to the craft beer industry. Exactly what those talents are remains debatable. But what is not debatable is his love of beer and spending time at craft breweries. Prior to establishing Grand Central Brewhouse, Kevin was one of the three original employees at American Strategic Insurance, more commonly known as ASI, a property insurance company based in St. Petersburg. After 21 years at ASI and following the acquisition of ASI by Progressive Insurance Group, Kevin retired from ASI. But long before he retired, he dreamt of owning a craft brewery someday. Kevin was an early enthusiast of craft beers, long before most people had heard of craft beers or microbrews. Before any craft breweries opened locally, Kevin regularly stopped into Shep’s on Fourth Street to pick up new craft beer to sample from around the country. Kevin, his wife Jeanne, and son Jack love to travel and craft breweries, pubs, beer halls, and beer tours became a significant part of the itinerary wherever they traveled in both the U.S. and Europe. The laid-back environment and large variety of innovative beers at craft breweries presented the ideal combination to spend quality time. In recent years, the brewery stops have become “research” trips. Kevin has incorporated many ideas from breweries and pubs from around the world into his vision for Grand Central Brewhouse, most notably serving beer directly from serving tanks. Kevin has also completed the Brewing Arts Program offered by USF St. Petersburg where he not only learned how to brew beer but gained foundational knowledge of owning and operating a brewery. Kevin moved to Florida from New York City in 1991 and quickly fell in love with the Tampa Bay area. Away from the brewery, Kevin is very active in the community, sitting on two charitable boards and supporting several local non-profits through the Milkey Family Foundation he established with Jeanne to support local charities in the St. Petersburg area. He is a huge sports fan and enthusiastically supports our Tampa Bay professional teams. An avid runner, Kevin has completed 11 marathons, which helps complement his other passion, beer. Zac Collins Head Brewer Zac has been at GCB since opening day.  Here’s a little background in his own words: ”As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a brewer. I’ve always been a fan of craft beer, along with other luxury intoxicants, but I haven’t always been able to afford them so like any enterprising young gentleman I found a way to get my beers for free. I brewed at St. Pete Brewing Co. and then Arkane Aleworks and now I brew at Grand Central Brewhouse. I always get asked the same questions so I’ll just answer them here; yes, my job is cooler than yours. Yes, I graduated law school and yes, you can find Joe Scribbleshoots modeling pictures online.” Matthew O’Connell General Manager Matt joined the Grand Central Brewhouse team as our General Manager in July 2021. His love for craft beer began while attending Florida State University. While earning his degrees in Entrepreneurship and Business Management, he also took on a Beverage Sciences minor through the school of Hospitality. The classes themselves taught about wine, beer, spirits, and other beverages (Juices, Coffee, Tea) but it was “Ales and Lagers of the World” that changed his entire career path. Matt learned about the world’s many beer drinking regions and the styles that they developed, malting, brewing horticulture, the fermentation process and the distribution chain, but actually getting to drink beer in class and discover the different flavor profiles is what got him obsessed. After class, he used to go to Proof Beer Bar (Before it was a brewery) so that he could further his “research” and also collect the sweet glassware from their brewery giveaways. He became so focused on beer his parents bought him a homebrew recipes book that Christmas and started gathering equipment to brew his very first batch. After college, Matt moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 2012 and got hired at Harpoon Brewery as a Beer Hall Captain, tending bar, giving tours, selling merchandise and working festivals. After 2 years of city life and 2 of the worst winters on record, Matt headed for greener pastures and warmer weather in Saint Petersburg. He immediately got hired at the new Green Bench Brewing Company in the fall of 2014 and started out as a bartender. Over the next seven years, Matt worked his way through the front of the house, from shift lead, to cider and mead assistant, then event coordinator and finally, General Manager. Along the way he gained extensive knowledge of barrel aging and foeders, wild yeast and mixed culture fermentation, cider and mead production, and an appreciation for lager. He also made some lifelong friends along the way. During the Pandemic, Matt contemplated a new career path due to all the uncertainty surrounding the Craft Beer Industry and his own fears of burnout. It was then that he got a text from now Head Brewer Zac Collins asking if he was interested in a new role. After two meetings and day to think it over, Matt decided to keep his love of beer alive and join the Grand Central crew to continue his passion for lagers. When Matt isn’t pouring beers, fixing something around our tasting room or swinging off a ladder changing lightbulbs or hanging decorations, he likes to spend his free time with his beautiful wife Chelsy and their son Aidan. He enjoys traveling, food, video games, dogs, and fishing. Stacy Maynard Event Planner Stacy has been beertending at Grand Central Brewhouse since day one. With no previous beertending experience she was equally excited and nervous to share her talents in the craft beer scene and learn more about the beer she enjoys. Her only knowledge of craft beer at this point was based off of informal lessons from friends in the beer industry, specifically at Hops and Props. Stacy continued to work full time at Bank OZK, looking at the brewery job as something fun to do on the side. Stacy quickly became one of the many staff members at GCB who is Cicerone Certified. Stacy later learned of a position opening at Grand Central Brewhouse for an event planner for public events, which she graciously accepted. She had always thought an event planner role would be fun and more suiting to her personality but wasn’t sure it was in the cards considering her banking and finance background. She was leaving an over 15 year career in banking. Stacy quickly realized this career change was the right move and not long after was asked to take on the private events at GCB as well. Stacy moved to Tampa Bay at the age of 11 with her family from Trinidad and Tobago and has loved everything Tampa Bay ever since. Outside of the brewery, Stacy is an active volunteer in the community, and with her church. Stacy is a member of the Pink Boots Society and recently attended her first of many Craft Brewers Conferences. She is a huge Green Bay Packers fan, though tries to support the Bucs as much as she can. Though no formal accomplishments, she enjoys rollerblading and biking often. Eric Trinosky Brewer Eric joined GCB in March 2022 and this is his story: “Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me in my current profession, I thought I would give home brewing a try and see what might lay in store for me.  It has now become a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Working for the last 12 years in the brewing industry, refining my skills and techniques, has culminated in my employment here at Grand Central. I was born in a small town in Central Indiana And I can breathe in that small town Gonna die in a small town Oh, and that’s probably where they’ll bury me.” Teamwork Makes the Dream Work: The Collaborative Efforts at Grand Central Brewhouse At GCB, collaboration is key. This passion project began with Kevin Milkey, a former insurance professional turned brewery owner. His vision brought together an experienced team, including brewers Zac Collins and Eric Trinoskey and General Manager Matt O’Connell. Zac and Eric’s brewing expertise blend well with Matt’s extensive experience in craft beer operations and event management. The team at GCB shares ideas and draws inspiration from global brewery visits. A notable feature is serving beer directly from copper serving tanks, a European tradition. This collaborative spirit ensures GCB offers a unique, high-quality experience that sets it apart. MISSION Taste the Difference: Grand Central Brewhouse's Mission in Action GCB’s mission is evident in every pint. Kevin Milkey’s dedication to craft beer, developed over years of global travel and study, informs the brewery’s approach. Whether it’s an IPA, Lager, Ale, or Sour, each brew aims to deliver distinct flavor profiles to delight your palate. The focus isn’t just on brewing; it’s on creating an experience that showcases the richness and diversity of craft beer.\nServing beer from copper tanks emphasizes freshness and quality, enhancing your tasting experience. This detail underscores GCB’s commitment to bringing innovative brewing techniques to the local community. Grand Central Brewhouse was designed to be an integral part of the community; a comfortable neighborhood meeting place, with a variety of indoor and outdoor spaces, highlighted by a large beer garden, from which to relax and enjoy a craft beer with friends and family.  People are the heart of this city and therefore, the heart of our mission. Grand Central Brewhouse will be a spot for the community to come together, make memories, and taste quality, craft beer. A place for beer enthusiasts and casual consumers alike, Grand Central Brewhouse’s drink menu features a wide variety of lagers and a full range of ales using the highest quality ingredients available.  Lagers are very under-represented in the craft beer arena, but most beer drinkers prefer lagers, especially on a warm Florida day. So, we will fill the void with a nice selection of light, amber and darker lagers.  Our Ales will include pale ales, IPAs and darker ales such as porters and stouts, wheat beers, plus some funky and sour beers.   Quality and drinkability will be of utmost importance. The Triple Bottom Line Grand Central Brewhouse's Recipe for Success GCB’s success is built on three pillars: people, planet, and profit. Fair wages and a positive work environment are priorities, reflecting a deep commitment to employee well-being. Sustainability is equally important; GCB integrates eco-friendly practices into daily operations to minimize environmental impact. Community engagement is another cornerstone. Through the Brew Good program, GCB supports local non-profits, contributing to the broader St. Petersburg community. This holistic approach not only defines GCB’s business model but ensures that every pint poured positively impacts more than just your taste buds. Grand Central Brewhouse will be a Triple Bottom Line business.  Of utmost importance to our mission is our goal of Sustainability by equally emphasizing Social and Environmental concerns as well Economic, also known as the three P’s: People, Planet and Profit.  We will measure our success based on our impact on our community and positive impact on the environment in addition to traditional profit margins. For the People/Social Equity bottom line, we will emphasize fair pay, employee well-being and quality of life in addition to giving back to our community. For the Planet/Environmental bottom line, we strive to be stewards of the environment by continually reducing our carbon footprint by utilizing solar power, sky lights and other green building practices in addition to reducing toxins and waste as well as developing water conservation practices. Regarding Profit, to be a successful sustainable organization, the company must be profitable.  Profit is necessary for creating employment, spurring innovation and it plays an integral part in meeting our social and environmental goals.

The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing.
