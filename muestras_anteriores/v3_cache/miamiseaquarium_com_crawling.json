Leer en español It’s just the latest in a string of legal battles for the embattled South Florida attraction. Noon report: The filing was made in bankruptcy court Monday by The Dolphin Company, which operates several animal theme parks and habitats, including the Miami Seaquarium. In it, the company lists its estimated assets at more than $1 million, but less than $500 million, with liabilities estimated to be in the same range. The move further calls into question the future of the facility, which has faced its fair share of challenges and scrutiny over the last few years. Back in February , executives with The Dolphin Company denied rumors they would be filling for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but at the time, they did admit they were starting a process to “restructure their financial liabilities.” The company has reportedly been facing financial stress, partly caused by issues at the Seaquarium. “We just learned about this yesterday,” said Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. “Our highest concerns have always been about the animals and, of course, we have to see how this is going to move forward now that there is a bankruptcy proceeding.” It was just last April, one year ago, that Miami-Dade County officials served the Seaquarium with an eviction notice , following allegations of poor conditions at the park and the deaths of at least two animals, including Lolita, a 57-year-old orca who had been held for decades in the same tank. “We are waiting to understand, but sometimes it seems bankruptcy takes precedent over other matters, so we are waiting for guidance from the court,” said Levine Cava regarding how the bankruptcy could intersect with the eviction process. Local 10 also previously reported about several small business owners who claimed the Seaquarium was not paying them money that they were owed. Newly published USDA reports that can be found at the bottom of this story indicate that in January, four dolphins were discovered laying on the floor of their tank, in diminished water levels, causing scrapes and abrasions on their chins, chest and fins. The inspection report said water was drained from the tank when a distracted employee not following written protocols started a backwash procedure of the pumps and filter, and instead of stopping the process after five minutes, continued to drain the tank for the next several hours. Then, medical records found that on New Year’s Eve, Snapper, an adult female sea lion, vomited a piece of foam tracked back to a foam pad used in a medical procedure the day before. “At the point of which if the USDA determines the animals are not safe, we will work collaboratively and we have put together plans,” said Levine Cava. “At this point, we don’t know what will be determined by USDA that has jurisdiction over the animals.” Concerns about the animals’ wellbeing have been the subject of many protests outside the Virginia Key park, including one held days after the county filed its notice of eviction. “It is time to shut them down,” activist Hilda Cummings said. “Too many animals are suffering, too many animals have died.” A USDA inspection report from 2023 also noted six cases where animals had not received routine prevention or care at the facility for more than a year. The Mexico-based company later denied those reports, saying they remain committed to animal safety and well-being. “Leaving dolphins trapped at the bottom of a nearly empty tank is only the latest evidence that animals will continue to suffer for as long as the doors stay open at the decrepit Miami Seaquarium,” PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement to Local 10 News. “This slimy operation couldn’t be trusted to provide marine mammals with bare minimum care when it wasn’t bankrupt, and every day that the animals are stuck in this hellhole is a day closer to death. PETA is calling for these animals to be immediately released to reputable facilities that know how to provide them with adequate care.” The Dolphin Company is now fighting the county’s eviction efforts with the matter now tied up in mediation.

Organization: Dade Media, Inc. Committee Position: Member Andrew Hertz is the President of Dade Media, Inc.  Dade Media operates billboards and other outdoor advertising from Tampa south to Miami.  Prior to running Dade Media, Andrew worked at Miami Seaquarium for 22 years, the last 15 as the President and General Manager.   During his time at the park, Miami Seaquarium reinvented itself with major upgrades and significant renovations. This has included the unveiling of Sea Trek and Dolphin Harbor, two of the park’s main interaction programs. Outside of his work, Andrew has served as a committee member, committee chair, or board member of several different organizations in the South Florida Community including both the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Miami Convention and Visitor’s Bureau.
