More than 7,000 crab species, in 100 different families, are known today. Their unique physiology and complex behaviours have made them one of the most diverse and adaptable of all animal groups. They can thrive in the darkness of abyssal seas, on the edges of scalding hot volcanic hydrothermal vents, on sunlit coral reefs, on wave-washed rocky shores, and in tropical rainforests at the tops of mountains. They even persist in some of the harshest desert conditions. Playing a vital role in marine and coastal ecology, crabs have been identified as keystone species in habitats such as coral reefs and coastal tropical swamps. Crabs comprises five chapters: evolutionary pathways; anatomy and physiology; ecology; reproduction, cognition, and behaviour; and exploitation and conservation. Individual chapters include a variety of subtopics, each illustrated by exceptional images, and followed by numerous double full-page species' profiles. Each profile has been chosen to emphasize remarkable and intriguing aspects of the life of these fascinating creatures. Some species may be familiar, but many are beyond anything you have probably seen before and will stretch your understanding of what a crab is. Written by a world authority, Crabs offers an accessible overview of these fascinating crustaceans. Customer Reviews Review this book Biography Peter J. F.

From their unique appearance to their intriguing behaviors, crabs have a special place in the animal kingdom. In this article, we will explore the diverse world of crabs, their characteristics, habitats, reproductive strategies, and their importance to human beings. Join us on this exciting journey into the fascinating world of crabs! Evolution and Classification Crabs belong to the infraorder Brachyura, which is derived from the Greek words \"brachys\" meaning short and \"oura\" meaning tail. This name accurately describes their distinguishing feature - a short, hidden tail, also known as the abdomen. The evolution of crabs is a remarkable story that dates back to the Jurassic period. The earliest known crab, Eocarcinus, appeared during this time, although it lacked some of the defining features of modern crabs. Today, there are approximately 7,000 species of crabs, making them one of the most diverse groups of decapod crustaceans. Crabs are classified into different superfamilies based on their unique characteristics. Some of the notable superfamilies include Dromioidea, Homoloidea, Raninoida, Cyclodorippoida, and Eubrachyura . Each superfamily has its own distinct features and evolutionary history. Description and Adaptations Crabs are easily recognizable with their hard exoskeleton and distinctive shape. They have a unique body structure with a cephalothorax, which is a fused head and thorax, and an abdomen that is tucked underneath. This body structure is known as the carapace. The carapace provides protection for the crab's internal organs and acts as a shield against predators. One of the most fascinating features of crabs is their claws, known as chelae. These claws come in various shapes and sizes, depending on the species. Male crabs often have larger claws compared to females, which they use for a variety of purposes, including defense, gathering food, and attracting mates. The shape and size of the claws can vary greatly depending on the species and their specific adaptations. Crabs also have highly mineralized exoskeletons made primarily of chitin, a tough and flexible material. This exoskeleton provides support and protection for the crab's body. As crabs grow, they must periodically shed their old exoskeleton and form a new one through a process called molting. Molting is a vulnerable time for crabs, as they are soft and susceptible to predation until their new exoskeleton hardens. Habitat and Distribution Crabs can be found in a wide range of habitats, including oceans, freshwater, and even on land. They are distributed all over the world, with some species adapted to specific environments. Crabs are particularly abundant in tropical regions, where they thrive in diverse marine ecosystems. In the ocean, crabs can be found in all of the world's oceans, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They occupy various niches, from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea habitats. Some species are specialized for life in rocky intertidal zones, while others are adapted to sandy or muddy substrates. Crabs play an important role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems by controlling populations of other organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling. Reproduction and Life Cycle The reproductive strategies of crabs are as diverse as their habitats. Most crabs reproduce sexually, with males and females coming together to mate. Mating can occur in various ways, depending on the species. Some crabs engage in elaborate courtship rituals, while others rely on chemical or visual signals to attract mates. Female crabs have a unique adaptation called ovigerous behavior, where they carry fertilized eggs on their abdomen. They protect these eggs until they hatch into larvae. The larvae, known as zoea, are released into the water where they go through several stages of development. During this time, they are part of the planktonic community and rely on ocean currents for dispersal. Once the larvae have developed into megalopae, they undergo metamorphosis and transform into juvenile crabs. The juveniles settle on the ocean floor or in other suitable habitats, where they continue to grow and molt to reach adulthood. The process of reaching adulthood can take several years, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Behavior and Adaptations Crabs exhibit a wide range of behaviors and adaptations that allow them to survive in their respective habitats. They have a unique way of walking sideways, known as crabwise, which is made possible by the articulation of their legs. This sidelong gait is more efficient for crabs and helps them navigate their environment. Crabs also have specialized adaptations for feeding and defense. Their claws, as mentioned earlier, play a crucial role in capturing prey and defending against predators. Some crabs have developed specialized feeding strategies, such as filter-feeding or scavenging. Others are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a variety of plant and animal matter. Communication is another important aspect of crab behavior. Crabs use various signals, such as drumming or waving their pincers, to communicate with each other. Males often engage in aggressive behaviors to establish dominance and gain access to females during mating season. Some species of crabs also exhibit cooperative behaviors, working together to provide food and protection for their family. Importance to Humans Crabs play a significant role in the lives of humans, both as a food source and in cultural symbolism. Many species of crabs are commercially important and are caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide. They are a popular delicacy in many cuisines, known for their unique flavor and texture. In addition to their culinary value, crabs are also important in ecological and economic terms. They contribute to the balance of marine ecosystems by controlling populations of other organisms and serving as a food source for larger predators. The fishing industry relies heavily on crab harvests, with certain species being particularly sought after, such as the blue crab and the Dungeness crab. Crabs also hold cultural significance in many societies. They are often associated with the ocean and are considered symbols of adaptability and resilience. In some cultures, crabs feature prominently in folklore and mythology, representing various qualities such as protection, transformation, and perseverance. Conservation and Future Challenges Like many other marine organisms, crabs face numerous challenges due to habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing. Some species are particularly vulnerable to these threats, and their populations have declined significantly in recent years.

By using citizen science, we are achieving a much greater scale of monitoring than would otherwise be possible, and expanding what we know about the community of organisms that lives in salt marshes and pocket estuaries. Crab Team has two main goals: Detect European green crab at the earliest possible stage of invasion to increase the ability to control population and reduce green crab impacts. Build a long-term dataset on green crab and other mobile organisms living in soft sediment habitats to improve the understanding of Washington’s pocket estuaries and salt marshes, and track green crab impacts. Learn more about the European green crab threat and how Crab Team is working to address it in the First Detector webinar , which summarizes the history of and local response to European green crab in the Salish Sea.

To date, we have served tens of thousands of satisfied guests from all walks of life, and they keep coming back for more! Founder And King Crab, Ron Lou, Is The Mastermind Behind Our Unique Seafood Boil Concept. California native Ron Lou spent four years in the National Football League playing center for the Houston Oilers then the Philadelphia Eagles. After retiring from professional football, he spent the next 35 years creating five different restaurant concepts, including a breakfast eatery, a sports bar and three different Chinese restaurants. Ready for another success, Lou set out to create something unique – not just another wing, burger or pizza place. In 2013 the culmination of Lou’s efforts resulted in the opening of Angry Crab Shack. Combining bold flavors customary in Asian cuisine with his knowledge of seafood, Ron introduced seafood boil to Mesa, Arizona. A family-friendly neighborhood restaurant, Angry Crab Shack offers a vibrant, memorable dining environment and high-quality seafood at a more affordable price. After repeatedly achieving remarkable sales growth and ROI, and then launching our first franchise-owned store at record-breaking sales revenue, we officially began franchising in 2017. The simplicity and bold flavors of our seafood boil, affordable prices, and strategic real estate practices has resulted in the winning franchise business model we operate today. Expanding into other states and into Europe, seafood lovers from near and far can find their way to an Angry Crab Shack and experience the broad menu, outstanding service, and genuine hospitality in a one-of-a-kind environment. Now, we’re looking to continue to expand and grow our Angry Crab Shack franchise family. WANT TO JOIN THE FAMILY?
