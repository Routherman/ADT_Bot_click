Our mission is to create a space for everyone, bringing community together as your friendly neighborhood bar. Come as you are and enjoy Texas BBQ and beer brewed right in our taproom! Interested in Collaborating? The Food Executive chef Jordan Smith As some former StormKing patrons know, Jordan fell in love with barbecue way before he ever went to Texas. Market BBQ on Nicollet Ave in Minneapolis will always have a special place in his heart, but it was after a trip south that he decided he was ready to commit. Just like with NY Style pizza, he wanted to eat it in his home town, so he got to work. Excellent meat from clean sources, super fun giant smoker, and a bit of a rub that allows the natural flavors of the meat to shine, not be diminished. If you love meat, you will love this barbecue.

Consisting of equal parts Irish pub, craft brewery, and restaurant makes Shamrock Brewing Company a truly unique Pueblo restaurant experience. We believe great beer , excellent food , and good friends go hand in hand. The food is great, the beer is world class, and the craic is outstanding! Craic (pronounced crack) is a Gaelic word, meaning a fun, friendly and exuberant atmosphere. Whether for business or pleasure, Shamrock Brewing Company in Pueblo, Colorado is the place to meet. Our antique mahogany bar is warm and inviting. We offer an extensive list of top-shelf Irish and Scotch whiskeys, an ample wine selection, and specialty cocktails; but our passion is craft beer. Not to sound too selfish, but we brew what we want to drink. Our base two-row base malt is the freshest around, malted right here in Colorado.  We also use the choicest hops from the Pacific Northwest and yeast strains carefully chosen by our brewer.  We never use additives, preservatives or pasteurization in our brewing process. We are equally passionate about our food and, of course, we cook with our beer – something that good cannot be reserved entirely for drinking! Chef and GM Gordon Cossar (a.k.a. Chef Gordo) only uses the freshest ingredients and everything is house made – including our salad dressings and desserts.  Our chef-inspired Irish specialties and American brewpub fare offer something for the entire family. Shamrock Brewing Company serves as a meeting place for everything from business lunches to family dinners, and everything in between. Stop by for our Pueblo restaurant and brewery for weekend brunch, lunch, happy hour (temporarily unavailable), dinner or the late night menu. Our passion is craft beer and great food, but we also love sports and show all the games on our many HD TVs. Meet your friends or make new ones, bring your family or host an event – just make sure you come thirsty and hungry. Slainte! Football Fans – The Shamrock is the best place to watch all the games in Pueblo with NFL Sunday Ticket and all the NCAA games. Stop by for Saturday and Sunday Brunch and catch all the action!
