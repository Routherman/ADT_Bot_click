Home brewing was the perfect excuse to invite friends to watch sports and tinker with recipes. Eventually these gatherings became quite large and brews such as Broad Brook Ale became popular around town. After much insistence from friends and family to open an actual brewery, Tom and Eric teamed up with other home-brewing childhood pals and began entering beer competitions… and they started winning. By the time Broad Brook Brewing made it’s official debut in East Windsor in October 2013, we had already built a loyal fan base. After a few years “on tour” with a handful of award winning beers at Beer Festivals around Greater Hartford and Springfield, we opened our first brewery and taproom location in Sofia’s Plaza. Grand Opening Day was met with a line of local fans stretching out the door, ready to sample our beer in a real tap room. 241 Mug Club Memberships sold out the very first day. Soon the “beer boom” hit. It took only two and a half years to smash our ten year projections, outgrowing the facility. We simply couldn’t brew beer fast enough to keep up with demand from customers, bars, and distributors. In order to keep all of Connecticut & Western Mass stocked with our 30+ styles, we had to expand. After an exhaustive search for a larger facility in our home town, it was clear we needed to construct a brand new brewery. We found a property just across the CT River, and quickly began construction in Suffield, CT. Met with a multitude of challenges during construction, forces beyond our control led us to leave our first location in December 2017, prior to completion of the new building. More delays demanded that we get creative to stay alive. Our friends at Stony Creek Brewery were gracious enough to brew our three most popular styles and keep shelves stocked while we completed the project. The owners and staff had to return to their day jobs, and there were sometimes doubts that we would ever return. But after 30 months of being the brewery without a home, we hammered the final nails and opened for business in June 2020. (Right in the middle of a global pandemic.) Thanks to the support of our community, customers, and loyal beer fans, we have returned! Our new brewery and taproom at 915 South St, Suffield CT is now open for limited indoor + patio seating, just North of Bradley Airport. Our new facility is capable of brewing over 13,000 barrels a year, and packaging 300% more cans than previously possible. Our Mug Club has expanded to 300 members and we now have a full kitchen. Our new Executive Chef, Derek, has created a brand new menu offering brick oven pizzas, sandwiches, wings, charcuterie plates, and more. Our food menu changes frequently and many items are made with our current beers infused into the recipe. When the lock-downs lift, we plan to have beer dinners, breakfast, live music, yoga, comedy, and private parties. We are so excited just to be brewing beer again and can’t wait for you to visit the new taproom. Follow our social media pages for details on phased re-opening, food offerings, beer releases, events, and expanding hours. You can also sign up for our Newsletter .  Thank you for all of your patience and support. It wouldn’t have been possible without you. We are back, cheers! Our state of the art facility features two brewing systems, a 30 Barrel production system where we make almost 1000 gallons in a batch along with our 3 Barrel pilot system that makes 90 gallons in a batch.

      "text": "Team | Homebrew.co Homebrew Portfolio Philosophy Resources Team Blog Portfolio Jobs Team Hi! We’re Homebrew. Our team is small but mighty. Like your startup. And together, we’ll work like mad to turn your vision into reality. Satya Patel Partner Prior to Homebrew, I was VP Product at Twitter, building and leading the Product Management and User Services teams. Before Twitter, I was a Partner at Battery Ventures, where I co-led the seed and early stage investing practices. I joined Google in 2003 and was responsible for AdSense product management and partnerships. Before heading to Silicon Valley for Google, I worked for DoubleClick, in venture capital and as a strategy consultant. My education is memorialized by a BS in Finance and a BS in Psychology from The University of Pennsylvania. Hunter Walk Partner Before Homebrew, I led consumer product management at YouTube, starting when it was acquired by Google. I originally joined Google in 2003, managing product and sales efforts for AdSense, Google‘s contextual advertising business. My first job in Silicon Valley was as the founding product and marketing guy at Linden Lab. Before graduate school, I was a management consultant and also spent a year at Late Night with Conan O‘ Brien. My parents are proud of my BA in History from Vassar and MBA from Stanford University. Beth Scheer Head of Talent At Homebrew, I work closely with our founders and their executive team members as an advisor on all things Talent-related, including recruiting, diversity & inclusion, compensation, onboarding and people operations. Prior to Homebrew, I spent 5+ years at Salesforce leading executive search, sales leadership search and the sales growth/professional services recruiting teams. Before Salesforce, I built the Google AdSense team starting in 2003 and then spent 6 years hiring for business operations, corporate communications and various engineering teams. I’m a proud graduate of The Colorado College with a BS in Psychology. Carly Osmonson Director of Operations I've spent the bulk of my career in the venture capital space and have a broad range of experience in supporting partners, planning events for founders, and building strong relationships with Limited Partners. Throughout my career, I’ve worn many hats, which has given me a well-rounded perspective on the startup ecosystem and a deep understanding of both the entrepreneurial journey and the investment side of the business. I’m a proud second-generation graduate of the University of Oregon. Go Ducks!

You may have heard of The Founders Club, who supported us as we opened our doors. By popular demand, and now that you have had a chance to get to know us, our beer, and our vibes, we’d like to invite you to join our Settlers Club! Our mission is to cultivate a thriving community hub in a welcoming space that fosters engaging conversation over delightfully crafted beer. We are here to build this community that we love so much (and Colin grew up in) by providing a place for neighbors to become friends and share in Gemutlichkeit! We are a small, family-owned business, so we can’t do it alone. Since we opened a little over a year ago, we have been so grateful for every person who walks through our doors including Founders and regulars who we otherwise would not have had the pleasure of getting to know. We’re ready to continue building our community by opening the Settlers Club to make us your Home away from Home. You will be helping us develop our distribution program so that we can bring our beers to a wider audience and further grow our community! Now, on to the good stuff! The Settlers 🍻 Beers with Benefits First mug of beer on us every day! Mug Upgrade Psst…Mugs hold more beer! You get a mug of beer at pint price! 1 glass growler Monthly beer fill to enjoy at your Home 64oz in Growler or Crowlers ***See T&Cs for more details 🎁 Special Offers 10% off merch/gear Price $3250 + Tax for a Lifetime Membership Become a Settler KEEP IN MIND: THESE MEMBERSHIPS MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR THE BEER-LOVER IN YOUR LIFE! WE’VE GOT YOUR FATHER’S DAY GIFT RIGHT HERE Have any questions? Send us a note: team@homestatebrew.com FAQs I have questions about my membership. Who do I contact? You can reach the HSB Team via team@homestatebrew.com or our contact form. What is the HSB Settlers Club? This is a club for folks that may not have gotten a chance to join our Founders Club, but still want to be a part of the HSB story. We are all settling down into our Home State and building our community right here! These are exciting times for us because we are fulfilling our mission: this community! We are offering this club to continue to foster that community in our taproom. These funds will go directly to the business and to helping us kickstart our distribution program! If you've wondered why your other spots don't have HSB beer, you won't have to wonder much longer! (Feel free to tell us where you want to see our beer, and make sure to tell the other spots to serve HSB beer too!) Together, we will better be able to spread the word about our wonderful taproom filled with Gemutlichkeit. What a great way to gather together with friends! What is Gemutlichkeit? It is a German word often used in the beer world. It is the idea of a state or feeling of warmth, friendliness, and good cheer. Coziness in good company like the feeling you get being around your friends and/or family at a celebration. How long does the membership last? Your membership is for life! It lasts as long as you do. See Terms and Conditions for more details. What’s a mug? Roughly 4 more ounces of beer – See us in the taproom to find out! This is approximately 125% of beer compared to the regular size beer glass (when we use European style glassware, the numbers get iffy) Define “every day” for The Settlers’ complimentary first beer 1 day is the span of time within the taproom serving hours from open to close. Even if the clock strikes midnight, the Settler must wait until the next business day opening for the next “first” beer. If you leave and come in again on the same business day with a fake mustache, you have already had your free beer for the day – We know it’s you in there! ***T&Cs Terms and Conditions apply to the entirety of the above stated offerings Asterisks have been added throughout the page for special attention to explanations in this section. The terms and conditions of this contract may be altered at any time at the sole discretion of Home State Brewing Co. For example, Home State Brewing Co. reserves the right to revoke a Settler’s membership, without refund, for a Member’s refusal to observe taproom and brewery policies or code of conduct.

Licensed retailers are prohibited from purchasing beer unless it is solely for personal consumption and not for resale or distribution. Settlers must come to the Home State Brewing Co. taproom to redeem their beer benefits We do not have a magic carpet for freshly poured beer...yet Some exclusions may apply to mug pours For example, HSB designated limited release or High ABV beers Each Settlers Club membership is designated to the individual whose name is given at the time of purchase Purchase of SC membership grants permission to Home State to store SC member’s contact information, phone number and email. (Home State will use this information for communicating with SC member) Each purchased Settlers Club membership is valid for the benefits listed herein for the duration of the registered member’s lifetime As long as the Settler and the Home State Brewing Co. business, brewery, and taproom are alive and kicking We both have to be present for this lifelong journey to happen, but we’re all in if you are! We may or may not offer different types of memberships down the road. Time will tell - unless we get abducted by aliens. All sales are final: Non-refundable and Non-transferrable This money is going straight towards the brewery development as needed Upon your death, you may not bequeath your membership to someone else Term of contract ends at the passing of the Settlers Club member We will remember you fondly Inquire via e-mail for special circumstances – i.e. Alien abduction Maybe they like craft beer – Who knows? ...if you do know, please contact us via e-mail Purchase of SC membership does not count towards any other Home State membership programs.
