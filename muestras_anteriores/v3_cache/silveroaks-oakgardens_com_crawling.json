Read more Testimonials I found the module very helpful to get myself refreshed with these technical words of accounting. Your module on credibility resume has helped me a lot in modifying my resume, thank you. The program is well defined and continuity from one step to the other is very smooth. Kavitha Senior Accountant Mr. Florent and Mr. Rudi are the very first persons who introduced me to the word “MENTORSHIP.”\n\nI’ve got my very first Financial Controller position not because I am perfect for the job, but because both were willing enough to share their knowledge, invest their time and effort to develop a newbie like me.\n\nThrough their guidance I was able to understand the importance of keeping the balance sheet schedule updated, the importance of the P&L review and analysis, and most of all, how proper controls and procedure plays an important role in the hotel industry.\n\nThe development and training are not only technical. It also involves attitude development.\n\nI am happy that they have come up with an idea of introducing this platform where they are able to share and introduce more ideas and knowledge in a manner that will be convenient at anyone’s own time and preference. Mary Grace Finance Manager I joined Ka’ana Resort in May 2014 and oh boy, what a difficult time it was for me. Recently graduated and having no clue of where I was, or what I was doing. The Finance team was restructured under the guidance of Mr. Florent and Mr. Rudi. Since then, things became a bit clearer.\n\nMentoring and training was immediately started by both of them. Both Mr.Rudi’s and Mr.Florent’s philosophy is  “We don’t hide anything in the Finance Department” and as such, I started being exposed to absolutely everything. It was quite a challenging road, but it was worth every bit of it. Not only did I grow in my professional career, but I also became a better individual and for that, I am thankful to both. Sara Financial Controller Guidance, mentoring and training provided by Mr. Rudi and Mr. Florent has had a significant impact in my professional career.\n\nThey have always been totally open when it comes to sharing their experiences and their knowledge.\n\nThe online program they have built has been easy to follow from the get go. The program easily transitions you from a positive attitude / mindset, to technical development. Following the program at my own pace is a plus.
