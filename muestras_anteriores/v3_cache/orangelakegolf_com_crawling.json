He has been at The Legends  Golf Club since it was constructed in 1991. Bishop Graduated from Purdue University in 1976 with a degree in Agronomy/Turf Management. Prior to moving to Franklin he was at the Phil Harris Golf Course in Linton, IN as the pro/superintendent from 1976-91. Bishop served as the President of the PGA of America in 2013-2014. During his term he was an activist for recreational golfers and their enjoyment of the game. He was instrumental in creating a close working relationship between the PGA of America and the PGA Tour serving two years on the Tour Policy Board. Bishop named public facilities such as Harding Park and Bethpage Black as PGA Championship and Ryder Cup sites. He worked closely with Arnold Palmer in the establishment of the Deacon Palmer Award which annually recognizes PGA members who have overcome a major obstacle in the career and served the game in an impactful way. He served on the rules committee at six Masters and two US opens. Bishop is a native to Logansport, IN.  He is a member of the Indiana Golf Hall of Fame and is a two-time recipient of the Sagamore of the Wabash from the Governor of Indiana. He is a former Indiana PGA Golf Professional of the Year and has received numerous awards from the Indiana PGA. Bishop has been married since 1976 to wife, Cindy.

Ted and Cindy have two grandchildren; Reid and Remy Davidson. Email Ted Ashely Davidson Member, Event and Wedding Coordinator Hello! My name is Ashely Davidson! My career in golf began long ago. I grew up playing junior golf in Indiana, played for Franklin Community High School, and ultimately went to the University of Kansas on a full golf scholarship. While at Kansas I participated in every tournament and earned Big 12 Conference and All Academic honors every season, and Most Valuable Player in 2002. After college I served on the Indiana Women’s Golf Association and was the founder of the Central Indiana Executive Women’s Golf Association Indianapolis Center. I also graduated from Leadership Johnson County in 2013, and chaired the LJC Wine dinner in 2016 and 2017, featuring more than 300 guests! Professionally after college I worked shortly at Eli Lily before coming to work as the membership coordinator at The Legends. After being in membership my job stretched into the planning and execution of events here at The Legends. I do all the planning for anything from a golf event to a wedding. Beginning in 2018 my job morphed into being in charge of all the catering, cooking, purchasing, and planning of events both onsite and off with our food truck. Many people at the course might say they barely see me but thats because I spend so much time in the back kitchen prepping and making food or I am on the food trucking getting things ready. I cant be the glue that holds this place together sitting at my desk! I feel lucky because I get to work with my parents, husband, and coworkers (that I call my friends) on a day to day basis. I especially felt that in 2019 when I became a breast cancer survivor and my co-workers   and family helped cover my responsibilities. That is what I love most about working at The Legends is that whenever someone needs help everyone slides over and helps where they are needed. Outside my work I enjoy spending time with my kids and watching whatever activity they are involved in! Email Ashely Ted Davidson Facility Manager, Food Truck Operator My name is Ted Davidson I grew up in Southport, Indiana and went to Southport High School and earned a Bachelors of Science Degree in Recreational Sports Management from Indiana University graduating in 2001. I have been employed at The Legends Golf Club since 2009. I grew up in the Lumber Business Davidson Industries a 80 year old family business that we as a family decided to sell in 2005. I continued to work in the lumber business till 2009 when i decided to take up a job at The Legends. I started out working a season Par 3/Dye building and have worked my way around the facility spending time in each department learning the overall big picture here at the club. I find that is the best way to get to know a facility or any business. When a person spends time in each area of a business they have a better understanding of the day to day procedures that are valuable in running a business. I spent 6 years in the pro shop learning customer service and how to handle many situations. Through those 6 years I spent stints in the cart barn and grounds maintenance learning and helping with day to day operations. In 2016 The Legends purchased a food truck to cater our own events/golf outings, and since the purchase of the truck I have spilt my time operating the truck with my wife Ashely and also taking care of the overall golf course facility. This is a big place with 300 acres and many buildings there is always repairs and upkeep needed around the facility. I have enjoyed my 15 years at The Legends Golf Club and each day presents something new. Email Ted Crystal Morse PGA Head Professional Crystal is a 15-year PGA of America Member and a native to Greenwood, Indiana. As a former standout junior golfer at Center Grove HS, Morse went on to play at Western Kentucky University, where she was named to the All-Sunbelt conference team and served as captain of the WKU team her junior and senior years.
