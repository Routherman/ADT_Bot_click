GENERAL RULES & REGULATIONS FOR LIVESTOCK EXHIBITORS PURPOSE The purpose of the North Florida Fair Youth/4-H/FFA Livestock and Animal Shows is to develop leadership, citizenship, a sense of understanding, self-assurance, sportsmanship, and an attitude of dependability in youth. Its aim is to provide meaningful experiences that will help youth develop into responsible, mature adults. The North Florida Fair Judging Events serve to teach the fundamentals of good animal husbandry, to emphasize quality in livestock and animals, and to demonstrate the finer points of showmanship and exhibition. In addition, they provide a suitable environment where youth can become better acquainted with other youth and adults and compete for recognition in an ever-growing complex society. NOTICE All exhibitors are cautioned to read carefully the following rules and regulations, as they will be enforced strictly, with no deviation. The North Florida Fair will be held on the Fairgrounds, November 6 – November 16, 2025.

Suwannee River Fair Association Inc. For nearly 75 years, the mission of the Association has been maintained and carried out by non-paid volunteers including citizen directors, parents, FFA Advisors, University of Florida County Extension Agents, and 4-H Leaders. Financial support through sponsorships, donations, and participation in the sale has been provided by community-spirited business men and women in the Dixie, Gilchrist, and Levy (Tri-County, Florida) area and beyond. Our deep appreciation is extended to these individuals, past, present, and future, without whose participation the fair would not be possible. It is a measure of a community's worth, the support it provides its youth. The founders of the Association, all active participants in the agricultural industry of the Tri-county area, also had the desire to instill in the youth participants, an appreciation and basic knowledge of the agricultural industry that is still a major economic and cultural influence in North Central Florida. The livestock show divisions are designed to be indicative of the local agricultural community. The mission of the association is to provide, through fair activities, an opportunity for any child who is a member of 4-H, and FFA, in Dixie, Gilchrist, and Levy Counties to gain skills, experience, and knowledge that will serve them well as they become productive members of the community. All activities, while competitive in nature, are for the primary purpose of educating and fostering the participant in the areas of organization skills, record keeping, self-reliance, self-esteem, responsibility, and good citizenship. « College Scholarships Vandalism At The Fair » Notices & Disclosures Livestock Links Animal Movement Requirements Livestock Ethics Classes Florida Fairs and Livestock Shows State of Florida Links Florida Animal Laws and Regulations Careers in Agriculture MyFlorida.com Suwannee River Fair Opt-Out Preferences Privacy Policy Sitemap Terms and Conditions Website Accessibility Suwannee River Fair PO Box 252 Trenton, Florida 32693 This website is currently under renovation to ensure accessibility by any disabled individual.
