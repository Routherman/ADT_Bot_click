Allison Doty Allison Doty Age: 31 Title: Taxidermist/ Owner Organization: MorgueMade How did you get into your career? I made a rat diorama and decided I would like to learn more about taxidermy. How does your passion play into how you serve your community? My passion is to help people grieve their beloved pets through art. What do you love most about Citrus County? It feels like family. Good and honest people. Who is a leader you admire? And why? Anyone who has the courage to be different for their businesses and lives. Words you live by.Â Be humble. Alyssa Bonomo Alyssa Bonomo Age: 39 Title: Owner/ Artistic Director Organization: ESharper Image Dance Studio Â Â How did you get into your career? Â When I started dance at the age of 3 years old, I always knew I wanted to own my own dance studio.Â  Throughout my years of training, I had numerous mentors that helped guide and teach me all aspects of how to run a business.Â  Iâve been a dancer, demonstrator, teacher, office assistant, office manager and at the age of 21, owner of my own dance studio.Â  With the support of many, this was a dream that blossomed into reality. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? I love dancing, but being able to share my love of dancing with other children in the community is what truly inspires me.Â  Knowing that I am able to educate children and also keep them involved in a positive activity is rewarding.Â  Also, we love showcasing our talent throughout community events. My dream and goal is to continue educating through both academics and Fine Arts while promoting and instilling positive self âesteem and enhancing confidence in oneâs self. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? I love Citrus County for the same reason why we moved here, for the âcommunity feelâ and the opportunities Citrus County presents for children and families.Â  I am thankful for the support our community has given me while growing my business.Â  I also love how our community comes together in times of need and the beauty of the âNature Coastâ that surrounds us.Â  I am proud to have called Citrus County home for the past 30 years. Â Who is a leader you admire? And why? I have both professional and personal leaders/mentors that I admire.Â  My professional mentors include the people that helped technically train me as a dancer and provided me with managerial and important life skills.Â  These people include Noretta Dunworth, Debbie Cole and Penny Knox.Â  The personal leaders I admire are those that have supported me emotionally and unconditionally and often pushed me past my breaking point to unlock the full potential within me.Â  Those people include Sue Jeffes, my parents and my husband.Â  All of these people shaped me into who I am today and encourage me to be the best version of myself every day. Â Words or quotes you live by âLife is a Dance one stage to the next.â My personal philosophy that I instill in my students is that âsuccess is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.âÂ  It takes a minute to dream it, but with persistence and dedication anyone can achieve their future goals. Alyssa Clossin Alyssa Clossin Age: 36 Title: President Organization: Alyssa's Critters Wildlife Rehab and Sanctuary Â Â How did you get into your career? Â I found a baby raccoon on the side of the road. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community?Â Helping people and animals is my whole life Â What do you love most about Citrus County? The people and the love we have for others. Â Who is a leader you admire? And why?Â Steve Irwin for his love and excitement for animals. Â Words or quotes you live by \"Success is not how high you have climbed but how you make a positive difference in the world.\" - Roy T. Bennette Andrew Chan Andrew Chan Age: 39 Official Title/Position: Chief Operating Officer Organization/Business: Right Rudder Aviation How did you get into your career? As a young child, I enjoyed growing up in Central Florida and watching the Space Shuttle launches.Â  My dreams took me to the heavens and beyond, and I knew in my soul that it was my destiny to become a pilot.Â  At 18 while an undergrad at the University of Central Florida, I became a pilot while majoring in entrepreneurship.Â  After placing second in a national business plan competition, a judge helped me launch my first aerospace firm.Â  Since then, I havenât looked back. How does your passion play into how you serve your community?Â For thousands of years, humans have looked up as birds took to the skies and enjoyed flight.Â  Lucky for us, one hundred and twenty years ago, the Wright Brothers made powered flight a reality, allowing millions to take to the skies.Â  The field of aviation is emotionally, civically, and financially rewarding.Â  It has been my goal to help the youth of Citrus County by creating permanent career-level jobs that will empower the community to soar to new heights. What do you love most about Citrus County?Â Without a doubt, the Citizens of the County are the best part of living here.Â  I have seen it time and time again- when action is needed, the community steps up to help those in need.Â Who is a leader you admireâ¦ and why? Sir Richard Branson- he is a true entrepreneur, adventurer, and innovator, all while finding a work-life balance that allows him to be a great Family Man.Â  His unique style allows him to accomplish impossible tasks while giving back to the world.Â  He is a leader who leads by example. Words or quote you live by: âNothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.â â President Calvin Coolidge Antoin Scriven Antoin Scriven Age: 34 Official title / Position: Teacher ESE/Math Algebra Organization: Lecanto High School Â How did you get into your career?Â After graduating college, I always knew I wanted to help the youth. One day I received a phone call from a good friend asking if I would like to teach and coach football. He knew of an opportunity that was about to present itself. Because of that phone call I truly believe I found my purpose in life, and I havenât looked back in three years later. How does your passion play into how you serve your community? I work with the youth in my community daily. Iâm thankful I have a chance to pour positive energy into them daily helping them evolve into great young men and women our community needs. What do you love most about Citrus County? Opportunities and obstacles it presents to make you a better person. Who is a leader you admire... and why? My aunt Danita Smith. She never hesitates to share what knowledge she has. Her opinion on life and business is always helpful and valued because I know of the sacrifices, she made to put herself and family in a better position in life. My Aunt Danita holds me to a higher standard because she refuses to watch me, or other family members not stride to reach their full potential. What quote do you live by: âWhat you put into life is what you get out of itâ. Ashley Baker Dr. Monique Belin Age: 35 Title: Attourney/ Managing Partner Organization: Kovach & Baker Law Firm Â Â How did you get into your career? Â Growing up, I loved watching the show COPS every night with my mom and singing the song, âbad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna doâ¦â I always said I was going to be a detective one day. But at the same time, my dad was an attorney working at the public defenderâs office and one day he brought me to his work. I remember being in that office and being so intrigued with what my dad did. I knew at a very young age that helping people in the justice system was something I was interested in, I just didnât know which path I would take, law enforcement or defense attorney. It took me quite some time to come to my conclusionâ¦. When I was 25, I was working at a law firm and I wrote out a list of all the pros and cons between the two careers and three things stuck out: family, being in control of my own career, and my dad. I didnât want to be away from my family working late, long nights, weekends, or holidays. I didnât want anyone to be able to tell me what direction my career would go in; I wanted to be my own boss one day. And most importantly, I wanted to follow in my dadâs footsteps and work alongside him like he did with his dad so many years ago. So, in 2015, I made the decision to pursue law school and there was never a question in my mind about what area of law I wanted to practice. Fun Fact: I still watch COPS to this day, but now I sing the song a little differently: âbad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do, call Kovach and Baker to represent you.â Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? I love helping people, especially those who donât feel confident to have the voice, strength, or understanding to get the outcome or resolution they deserve. Going up against multibillion-dollar insurance companies and the criminal justice system can be intimidating, scary, and unpleasant. I enjoy being in a position where my knowledge, experience, and dedication help those in need, especially in the community that helps support me as a small business owner. When you walk into my office, youâre a stranger, but when you leave, youâre my family and when youâre at your worst, Iâll be at my best. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? I love the small-town feel where the community supports one another and local businesses whenever the opportunity arises. The culture is like one big family, always there for you when you need it. Â Who is a leader you admire? And why? My husband. He started off his career as a health insurance sales agent, working over 60 hours a week and the pay was commission only. Five years later, he has his own office, managing over 300 agents, consistently being the number one office in the country out of 100 offices every single week over the last two years in a row. Whatâs most admirable is he holds the respect of every single agent in his office because, throughout all his success, he has never treated any of them like they are less than. He helps everyone when and where he can whether it be for a business or a personal matter they are battling, he treats them like family and takes care of them. He acknowledges the importance of each one of them. He has not only shown me the true meaning of hard work and determination, but heâs shown me what is required to get there along the way which is having a team that respects you and trusts you. I try to manage my office and my staff everyday with that mentality because without them, Iâm nothing. Â Words or quotes you live by âProper preparation prevents poor performance.â Brean Bivins Brean Bivins Age: 30 Official Title/Position: Musician (Pianist), Piano Instructor, Board Member, Treasurer, Assistant Managing Organization/Business: Crystal River Community Church, Greater Mount Carmel Baptist Church, George Washington Carver Community Center, Copeland Community Park Association, Aspire Management How did you get into your career? Music has always been my passion. I began taking private piano lessons in the 6th grade and continued lessons all through high school. I also began playing for various churches and organizations throughout Citrus County to hone my skills. After high school I knew that I wanted to stay true to my passion while furthering my education. I began college at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Ga. and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Visual and Performing Arts. Throughout college, I maintained relationships with the churches and organizations for which I played piano during high school. After graduation I returned to Citrus County and began applying and auditioning for musician positions at various churches in the area and providing piano lessons to the youth.

Â Jacqueline Van Dyke Jacqueline Van Dyke Age: 39 Official Title/Position: President/ Founder Organization/Business: Gulf Coast Manatees Homeschool Group INC How did you get into your career? I have 3 children and was studying to be a teacher and life had other plans to switch to home education. I was a part of PTA & PTSA at local and county levels while my two eldest attended school and have always had a passion for children. I started homeschooling in 2016 and it has been amazing. Moving to Citrus County, there was not much available for homeschooling families and I started with classes and meet-ups and was asked about creating a group. It all grew like a wildfire from there. We chose to go the non-profit route to be able to fundraise and provide community service so that our children could gain more experiences, opportunities, and supplies for classes. How does your passion play into how you serve your community? I have always been a leader and volunteer, that started back in my 3rd grade year; as I headed up a book drive for children less fortunate, even being a child of lesser circumstance, myself. Children are our future and each child deserves to find their love for learning, their own path and to grow in a nurturing and safe environment. Our co-op provides this and we are a family. Gulf Coast Manatees helps support and supplement education and provides community outreach. We have fed the homeless, cleaned up church grounds, provided Christmas to families in need, held a foster care drive, and have more in mind for the future.

We work together to make education and experiences happen for our children. George Washington may not have started at the bottom like I did, but he became a general and a leader, like myself. More so, it was the people who made him see how much more he had to offer and give and provide, and that he could not do it alone. I am grateful for the people in my life and the families we have and the impacts being made within our community and for our children.

After losing my mother at sixteen, she made the effort to help me navigate a funeral, retrieve what precious little I could from my motherâs belongings, provide me transportation when I had no way home, and just to listen despite only knowing me for perhaps ten months. Mrs. Brunell chose to invest in me and give her time and energy to help me develop as a student and more importantly as a person, which I now realize likely came at the cost of some of her personal time for planning, lunch, and family. I am forever grateful and strive to have as much impact on my students as she did on me. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community?

In my senior year of High School, I attended a Criminal Justice course where I was encouraged to complete an application for the Citrus County Sheriffâs Office.Â  I was hired after graduating and began my career in the Communications Department as a 911 operator.Â  While working in Communications, I was able to complete my masterâs degree in criminal justice administration and constantly felt a nagging desire to attend advanced training courses and learn more about law enforcement in general.Â  In an effort to expand my opportunities for professional growth, I attended the law enforcement academy in 2010 and shortly thereafter transferred to work as a patrol deputy.Â  Within one year following this transition, I was promoted to the position of Domestic Violence Detective where I worked for three years.Â  As a result of my dedicated work in this field, in 2020 I was promoted to Sergeant of the newly formed Behavioral Health Unit.Â  I had the pleasure of creating a brand-new unit consisting of domestic violence detectives, behavioral health detectives, substance abuse advocates and victim advocates. In July 2023, I was presented with an opportunity to once again create a brand-new position; however, this time I would have a much bigger and narrowed impact and it would be within the School District focusing on our youth and adolescent population. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? My top three motivators in life are autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Â  Out of these three, I have found that purpose is my most powerful motivator.Â  The feeling of being part of something larger than myself and having a meaningful role or contribution within my community provides me with a deeper meaning to life.Â  Aside from my contributions to my career, I serve as the board chair for NAMI Citrus, am a member of the Womenâs Impact Council for United Way and am a Girl Scout Troop Leader.Â Â What do you love most about Citrus County? The saying âit takes a villageâ truly is represented here in Citrus County.Â  Any time our community is faced with adversity, everyone comes together to provide emotional, social, and financial support in times of need.Â Â Who is a leader you admireâ¦ and why? This was the hardest question to answer because I have been impacted by many great leaders in my lifetime and I admire a variety of things about each.Â  To narrow it down there was one that stood out because he possessed many leadership qualities that I admired; Captain Brian Spiddle.Â  He is a great leader because he knows how to inspire and motivate his team; he has high ethical and moral integrity, he is honest, transparent and consistent; he adapts well to changing circumstances and doesnât let others know even if it bothers him; he is humble and open to learning from others while also acknowledging the contributions they bring to the team; lastly he possesses a confidence that instills faith in others to believe in themselves in order to achieve their goals.

My husband and I are the founders of Footprints On My Heart because we have suffered pregnancy and infant loss. I have suffered from a blighted ovum, the stillbirth of our daughter Sophia Louise, several miscarriages, and the neonatal loss of our son Jaxon Thomas. During the grieving of the loss of our son, I noticed the lack of resources in my community for pregnancy and infant loss. Together we have survived it all to share our story, provide free services, and to help break the silence of pregnancy and infant loss. We founded Footprints On My Heart to not only help families of pregnancy and infant loss but also to keep our son, Jaxon Thomas's Legacy alive. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? I have been in these families' shoes and have unfortunately walked their walk more than once. I am able to relate to them on a much more personal level. I want to be there to help ease the confusion about what happens next.. Losing a child is soul-crushing, and I never want families to feel like they are alone in this unimaginable journey. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? I love how our county pulls together as a community. Somebody always knows somebody who can help and you always know someone in the room.Â Â Who is a leader you admireâ¦ and why? I admire George Schmalstig, CEO of United Way. I have had the pleasure of getting to know him during Filter Family Solutions. When he became CEO of United Way I was relieved as I knew he would lead them to great success.Â Â Â Words or quote you live by: â Be the reason someone feels welcomed, seen, heard, valued, loved and supported.â Rosa Scalzi Rosa Scalzi Age: 39 Official Title/Position: Chief of Staff Organization/Business: Citrus County Property Appraiser Â How did you get into your career? While I was finishing up my bachelorâs degree, I was fortunate to start my career in local government at 22 as an HR assistant. I really enjoyed being able to help my co-workers with anything in our office. From there, I realized this was definitely something I could be a part of long-term. I knew it was going to be a marathon and I stayed focused and was given opportunities along the way to learn and advance my skills within our organization. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? My passion is to help others in any way possible. Over the last couple years, Iâve had the privilege of being a part of a leadership team to slowly transform our office into something more than just a government office. I enjoy working behind the scenes to help our employees grow. Weâve been able to give opportunities to our employees to help support different organizations within our community. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? My family came to Citrus County when I was 4 months old. Now as an adult, Iâm thankful that I grew up here in our small community. There are so many great opportunities and experiences that I get to share now with my family. Â Who is a leader you admireâ¦and why? I canât necessarily pick just one. I feel like there are many people that Iâve crossed paths with in my life that I admire as leaders, and I try to include some of those things within me that I can share and bring value to others.

You grow it from the ground up. Feed it. Love it. Lie awake at night, with hopes, dreams, fears.. all the emotions. We get to be a part of that. It's almost like becoming a part of their family. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? Citrus is home. No matter where we go next, that will always remain true. Â Who is a leader you admireâ¦ and why? I admire my wife and partner, Krystal.

However, I was encouraged to explore the law by my older brother who understood how my analytical background would translate well to the legal profession.

During my time as a student at the College of Central Florida, I received support that was vital to my personal and academic growth. I knew I wanted to advocate for students the way my mentors had for me. Thus, my career began as a student worker and progressed to a Sr. Financial Aid Specialist, then to Manager of Student Affairs before taking on my current role as Director of Student Affairs. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? Because I became a student worker early in my academic tenure, I quickly developed a passion for the student experience. Iâve had the pleasure of serving students in many different roles allowing me to provide access, authentic attention, and meet students where they are. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? I love the engagement, vibrancy, and solidarity that bands us together as a community. Citrus County is extremely safe and supportive â making it an ideal place to raise a family and get involved.

Jackson Brown Jr. Â Stacey Wilson Stacey Wilson Age: 32 Official Title/Position: Business Owner, LMT, NASM-CPT Organization/Business: WOW Citrus Massage and Fitness MM#43503 Â Â How did you get into your career? I often said to my husband that if I could find a way to get paid for just caring about people, I would find my career. My life has been a journey trying to do just that. I found myself in a variety of job fields from sales, to food service, to health care; trying to figure out where I belonged. Eventually, I realized, I needed to go back to school and came across massage therapy. I enrolled at Withlacoochee Technical College and ended up falling in love with the career. As a business owner, I get to explore so many ways of helping others often overwhelmed by it all. At the end of the day though, I wouldn't change a thing. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? My passion has always been helping people. I get to do that in a variety of ways now. I serve at my church with Youth Ministry and sit on the board. I am a Program Advisory Committee Member for the Massage Program at Withlacoochee Technical College, where I also help occasionally throughout the year with the next generation of massage therapists. I also am happy to say through my business this year we are back to doing fundraisers for local non-profits. Â What do you love most about Citrus County? Citrus County has made me feel more at home than I expected. I've lived in other small towns before and felt like an outsider. Citrus County welcomed me and my business. I enjoy the community here, we are neighbors helping neighbors. Â Who is a leader you admire? And why? Gary Vaynerchuk ( or Gary Vee, as he is often known), is an odd choice for me, but I admire him still. I personally am not a fan of the language he uses sometimes, but he is solidly on his mission to just love what he does and care about others. I believe that is what makes him an effective leader, and I admire someone who stands up for who they are and has a heart for the community. Â Words or quotes you live by: Colossians 3:23 NIV --\"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, working for the Lord, not for human masters, ..\" is on my business cards. It's my driving force and my reminder when things are rough. Timothy Gilbert Timothy Gilbert Age: 35 Roles/Organization:Â Principle DevOps/Platform Engineer Imprivata Fundraising Committee Twisted Arts Initiative (Non Profit) Alternative Planning and Development Commissioner Citrus County Chair Citrus County Democratic Party Â How did you get into your career? Growing up amidst the computer evolution, my career path meandered through various tech-centered roles, including a memorable stint as a performer and a creative director at an International Escape Room Company, where my love for automation first ignited. Post-performance, I landed at a Robotic Engineering Company in Massachusetts, which further fueled my passion for automation. With a solid foundation from my business administration degree, I delved into automation courses and set up a home lab for hands-on learning, seamlessly transitioning into a rewarding career in automation engineering. How does your passion play into how you serve your community? At the age of 35, I find myself infused with a dynamic passion to contribute to my community in Citrus. This passion isn't about accolades or personal gain; it's about weaving a fabric of community engagement that holds tight, especially among young adults and families. I see an opportunity, a responsibility even, to stir the waters of traditional community involvement, making waves that resonate with the energetic and forward-thinking spirit of the younger demographic. By channeling my efforts into projects and initiatives that are both accessible and appealing to younger residents, I aim to create a platform where their voices are heard, and their contributions are valued. I believe in leading by example, in showing through actions how rewarding and impactful serving our community can be. The idea is to ignite a spark of enthusiasm and a sense of ownership among the next generation of Citrus residents, inspiring them to take the reins of community engagement into their hands. Every effort I put forth is with the vision of nurturing a community that's not just thriving today, but is poised for vibrancy and inclusivity in the years to come. It's about laying a foundation of active involvement and shared aspirations that I hope will inspire and awe not just my peers, but the generations that will call Citrus home in the future. In this way, my passion transcends individual ambition and becomes a conduit for collective growth and enduring community spirit What do you love most about Citrus County? The camaraderie among neighbors and the lively exchanges of ideas captivate me most about Citrus County. I cherish the diversity of thought here, as it fosters personal and communal growth, allowing each interaction to broaden perspectives and forge enduring relationships. The unique blend of warmth and openness in our community encourages meaningful dialogues, nurturing a culture of mutual respect amidst diversity. This environment, enriched with a spectrum of individual contributions, propels me to invest my energy and passion into serving and celebrating our vibrant community. Who is a leader you admireâ¦. And why? I greatly admire Barack Obama for his ability to inspire and unite people across diverse backgrounds. His eloquence and composed demeanor, especially in challenging situations, always struck a chord with me. One quote of his that resonates with me is, 'Change is never easy, but always possible.' It's a reminder that despite the challenges in the path of making a difference, with resilience and a shared vision, positive change is attainable. Obama's leadership, characterized by hope and persistent effort towards a more inclusive society, continues to be a source of inspiration for me in serving my community.

I graduated from FIU with my teaching degree because I wanted to help people.Â  There was a surplus of teachers when I graduated so most of the time I was working as a waitress.Â  My friend had just opened his mortgage company and asked me if I wanted to be his processor.Â  After four years in processing, I got my license and started my own company. Â How does your passion play into how you serve your community? My passion is helping others, I feel one person can do a lot and I use the company and the money it makes to help. The company not only helps people become homeowners, but I use the flexibility of my time to volunteer.Â  In addition, ten percent of the companyâs gross proceeds are donated back into the community and the church.

We recognize that existing businesses play one of the most important roles within our community in creating new jobs, contributing to our tax base, and helping to form and shape our local identity through the products and services they provide. In recognition of Business Appreciation Month, we offer this column in support of local small businesses. *** It is an impressive statistic: nearly 2/3 of all net new jobs are created by small businesses. From the dedicated entrepreneur that starts a home-based business, but then doubles, triples or quadruples its size as it begins to grow, maybe moves into a brick-and-mortar location and hires one, two or three new employees; to those second-stage businesses where the business plan becomes a long-range marketing plan, and they begin to expand into new products and services that require more employees to support a management team; each job they create adds to our economy. Each job gives a resident a chance to achieve financial success and provide for their families through the wages they earn. That alone is reason to value our local small businesses. But there is so much more. Small businesses must innovate to provide the goods and services that we need or want to increase our quality of life. To survive, they become adept at finding new ways to do old things. Small businesses have their finger on the pulse of the community — or even create that pulse, and their smaller size allows them more adaptability to changing economic climates when fast decision making is often needed and encouraged. Small businesses support the local community through taxes they pay that stay within our community. Typically, small businesses use less in public resources than they pay in taxes, thereby reducing the overall tax burden of the residents that do use those public resources. Small businesses are more often than not the first ones to support local causes and charities. Almost every large business started from a small business. Often, small businesses complement the larger ones by supplying components or outsourcing services to large firms or acting as sales agents. There is nothing easy about growing a business. And it is true that only about half of small businesses survive beyond the five-year mark, and only about a third make it through ten years. To help support these local businesses, the Citrus County Chamber of Commerce started a Business Retention and Expansion (BRE) program a few years ago. It is a fact that it is cheaper and more efficient in the long run to retain a business than to start a new one. The BRE program is dedicated to working with businesses one-on-one as a conduit for business resources, networking and advocacy. Under the BRE program, the Chamber’s first role is to listen to the businesses and learn more about their plans, their needs, and their concerns. Although we will never profess to have all the answers, we will dig deep to understand and respond to their needs. Drawing upon the expertise of our numerous partner organizations such as CareerSource, SCORE, the Economic Development Authority for Citrus County and the County’s Economic Development Department, the Citrus County Building Alliance, Withlacoochee Technical College, the College of Central Florida, Nature Coast Manufacturers’ Association or the Marion Regional Manufacturer’s Association, the Florida Virtual Entrepreneur Center and others, we can often match a business with a targeted resource to help them along their next step. Should a business need to appear before the city or county planning department on a zoning or permitting issue, the Chamber can attend pre-application meetings with the business to advocate and help the business understand the requirements of the code. The Chamber can also introduce potential business partners to one another, and we continue to share information or opportunities that we learn about. On a legislative level, the Chamber plays a large role in monitoring legislative matters that may affect our businesses directly or indirectly, and may advocate for or against issues that impact the economic value and quality of life of our community and our businesses. After all, the business is busy doing their business; the Chamber’s business is to stay aware and champion their efforts. We welcome Citrus County businesses to contact us about BRE services at 352-795-3149 or Ardath@CitrusCountyChamber.com . Ardath Prendergast is vice president of operations and the Business Retention and Expansion program with the Citrus County Chamber of Commerce.
