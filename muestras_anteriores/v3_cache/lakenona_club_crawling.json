This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we may receive or collect when you use our services, as well as some of the methods we use to safeguard your personal information. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND COOKIES We may from time to time collect personal information in order to understand your specific needs and serve you better. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number. Lake Nona may use cookies and other technologies to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use our website and services. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. While most browsers accept cookies by default, you can manually set your browser to refuse all cookies, accept cookies from specific websites, or highlight when a cookie is sent to your browser. Lake Nona’s servers may also automatically record information when you visit our website, including the URL that directed you to our website, your IP address, browser type and the date and time of your visit. There are two main types of cookies: Session cookies: These are temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session (when you leave the site). Session cookies allow the website to recognize you as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website most efficiently. Persistent cookies: In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are stored on your equipment between browsing sessions until expiration or deletion. They enable the website to “recognize” you upon your return. We may use session cookies to: Help us maintain security and verify your details as you use our website. We may use persistent cookies to: Collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use the website and help us improve our website. In addition to cookies which send information to us, we may also use cookies which collect information and send it to third parties. An example of this is Google Analytics.

Circumstances may arise, whether for strategic or other business reasons, in which Lake Nona decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in various countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or, conversely, the receipt of such personal information from sellers. It is Lake Nona’s established practice to seek appropriate protection for all personal information in advance of any such transaction. We may make use of your information when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or legitimate governmental request, (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise address suspected fraud, security or technical issues, (c) enforce any applicable Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations thereof, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Lake Nona, its users or the general public as required or permitted by law.
