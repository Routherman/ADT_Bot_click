Follow View all 22 employees Report this company About us Riverwalk Fort Lauderdale is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization responsible for the planning, programming, and promotion of the Riverwalk District.  We pursue our mission, “to be the catalyst in building and nurturing Riverwalk and the Riverwalk District as a vibrant community connected by the New River”, through a range of fundraising, events and advocacy, and by providing valuable information through our website, Go Riverwalk Magazine and social media.\n\nRiverwalk produces annual signature events such as the Stone Crab and Seafood Festival, Burger Battle™, and Chili Cookoff that draw tens of thousands of people to the City of Fort Lauderdale’s downtown, as well as the annual Riverwalk Tribute that honors a member of the community for their exceptional accomplishments.  The Riverwalk Signature Brick program has seen 40,000+ etched bricks placed along the 2.5 mile Riverwalk Park, and the Riverwalk Banners program highlights corporate and individual support of Riverwalk to the District’s 1.5 million annual visitors.\n\nSince 2003 Riverwalk has produced the official Fort Lauderdale city magazine, Go Riverwalk Magazine, with twelve annual issues aimed at business and community leaders, residents and visitors alike.  Riverwalk has seven social media accounts, weekly e-blasts to Riverwalk and community members, and an active website that hosts the Greater Fort Lauderdale Events Calendar, which highlights events both in downtown Fort Lauderdale and throughout Broward County.\n\nRiverwalk is the primary advocate for the improvement and activation of the Riverwalk Park and the ten additional City of Fort Lauderdale Parks in the Riverwalk District.  Riverwalk has been responsible for the many art installations and public exercise stations along the Riverwalk, as well as advocating to establish the free Riverwalk Water Trolley.  Most recently, Riverwalk completed the 9/11 Memorial, displaying a segment of the PATH rail tracks taken from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.
