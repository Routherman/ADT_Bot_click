You place your order at the counter & they bring your food to a picnic table right next to busy Main St aka 580. I had an oyster & shrimp combo poorboy-very small oysters & shrimp which were cooked well, but there just wasn't enough seafood on the roll for the $10.99 My wife had a Cajun grilled cheese- 4 half pieces which was good but a little greasy. The gumbo that came with her sandwich was delicious. We give it a 5 on the 1-10 scale Maybe other items on the menu are superior but will not try Happy's again to find out.

Contact Send Paradise News A Letter to the Editors Distribution Locations Subscribe Happy’s Bayou Bites is Dunedin’s 1st Veteran Owned & Friendly Business November 10, 2018 by Paradise News Team The City of Dunedin’s U.S. Military Veterans Advisory Committee is proud to recognize Happy Bayou Bites as their first business to be approved as a Veteran Owned & Veteran Friendly business. The Committee was established in January of 2018. One of their first initiatives was to create a program that recognizes businesses in Dunedin as Veteran Owned and/or Veteran Friendly. The Committee recently finalized the program requirements, application and approval process and set out to begin implementing the program and recognizing approved businesses. The first business to be approved and recognized by the Dunedin U.S. Military Advsiory Committee is Happy’s Bayou Bites, a cajun and creole restaurant. The restaurant is 100% Veteran owned and offers $1 off meals to their Veteran customers. Owners, Mark and Happy Jordan opened Happy’s Bayou Bites after Mark retired from the Army, both their kids had left the nest for their own Army adventures, and they were looking for something to do that included food, Dunedin, friends and serving their neighbors. Happy’s Bayou Bites is located at 431 Skinner Blvd, Dunedin . Visit Happy Bayou Bites on Facebook to read about their story, hours, drink and mouth-watering menu items featuring cajun country cuisine. Show Off Your Military Support! Do you have a business that is Veteran Owned or Veteran Friendly? Requirements & Application. Once approved, you will receive a recognition decal to display at your business. The Veteran Owned/Veteran Friendly Business Recognition program is sponsored by the City of Dunedin U.S. Military Veterans Advisory Committee.
