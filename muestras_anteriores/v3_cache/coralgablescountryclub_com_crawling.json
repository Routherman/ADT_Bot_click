CONTACT US History OUR Amenities Location Weddings Corporate Social Gathering Film & Photography On-site Parking Built-in 1922, the iconic landmark developed by Coral Gables founder and visionary George Merrick was the city’s first public building. The Coral Gables Golf and Country Club is a historic venue located in the heart of Coral Gables and an illustration of the City Beautiful movement. The original building, designed by the architectural firm Hampton & Reimert, served to entertain prospective buyers from the structure’s distinctive tower while large crowds gathered to bid on undeveloped land in Coral Gables. In its heyday, the venue would attract large crowds that danced to the music of renowned bandleaders from an open-air bandshell located on the famous palm patio now forever lost to history. Much of the original building was lost to a fire in 1983, and the only remains considered of historical significance and homage to the original architectural style are the six coral rock arches seen across the golf course lawn. Today, the 40,000-square-foot facility gracefully blends the traditional Mediterranean style of the exterior façade with classical interior finishes found throughout the elegant Coral Grand Ballroom and three similarly appointed event spaces. In celebration of the Coral Gables Golf & Country Club’s centennial anniversary, the venue has been restored and reopened for the community and future generations to enjoy.

The eggs benedict were perfectly done. The sauce was not salty like in some other places. It was just what it was suppose to be, the toast of the meal that brought everything together. My husband had the American breakfast which also was perfectly done. We also ordered the chocolate almond croissant which was flakey and with the right amount of chocolate and almond. Would we go again? Yes!
