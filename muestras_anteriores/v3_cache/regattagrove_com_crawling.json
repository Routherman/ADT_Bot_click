We have been working together in the field of data management for two decades, developing state-of-the-art data technologies, disrupting multi-$B markets, and building market-leading companies that have created outstanding value for customers, team members, and investors. We have extensive experience developing scalable, high performance, distributed, elastic, robust data software platforms. This helped establish and grow companies like Topio (acquired by NetApp), Xtremio (acquired by EMC), Storwize (acquired by IBM), and ScaleIO (acquired by EMC). We are passionate about data, databases, and data infrastructure. We’ve seen firsthand how organizations try to solve problems by adding more and more complexity to their infrastructures. Complexity inhibits performance, limits scale, bloats code, and wastes money and resources. We’re here to change that. Much of today’s infrastructure complexity stems from database limitations and the related sprawl of databases, data warehouses, pipelines and ETL tools. Regatta enables enterprise-wide consolidation and standardization by offering a scale-out, distributed OLxP database that guarantees strong ACID with linearly scalable high performance – that uniquely enables the execution of distributed complex OLAP queries alongside fast OLTP transactions on up-to-the-second transactional data. Also, Regatta supports vectors and semantic search alongside operational data. Meet the team Boaz Palgi CEO & Founder Boaz is the CEO and co-founder of Regatta. Along with Eran and Erez, over the past 20+ years, he has helped build companies and enterprise-grade data-management products that are widely adopted by the world’s largest enterprises. Erez Webman CTO & Founder Erez is the CTO and one of the founders of Regatta. He is a computer-scientist, experienced entrepreneur, and a musician. With a career beginning in 1983, Erez has gathered extensive experience in the architecture and design of scalable and distributed data systems, and has helped to build companies and enterprise-grade data-management products that are used by many of the world’s largest enterprises. Eran Borovik VP R&D & Founder Eran, the Vice President of Research and Development and one of the founders of Regatta, possesses a deep passion for system engineering, distributed systems, and tackling complex technical challenges. He excels at collaborating with exceptional engineers to create high-quality enterprise-grade products. Throughout his career, Eran has played a pivotal role in building successful companies and developing top-tier products that are widely adopted by the world’s largest enterprises. 50+ Engineers 10+ Foundational patents filed 500+ Experiences with enterprise deployments Regatta Data info@regatta.dev Product Capabilities Company About Us Join Us Resources Blog How-To Demos Whitepapers Documentation Contact Us © 2025 Regatta Data.
