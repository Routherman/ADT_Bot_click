Quick Facts Young Quincy Jones Musician, Producer, and Composer Ex-Wives and Children Other Ventures and Controversies ﻿Death Who Was Quincy Jones? Quincy Jones was a decorated record producer, musician, and movie producer who was convinced at an early age to explore music by his teenage friend Ray Charles . He played in various bands through the 1950s, began composing for film and television in the mid-1960s, and eventually produced over 50 scores. Jones worked with famous musicians such as Michael Jackson , Frank Sinatra , Aretha Franklin , and Celine Dion . One of the most nominated and decorated artists in Grammy Awards history, Jones garnered 80 nominations and 28 wins. He also earned an Emmy Award for scoring the 1977 limited series Roots . Jones died in November 2024 at age 91. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Quincy Delight Jones Jr. BORN: March 14, 1933 DIED: November 3, 2024 BIRTHPLACE: Chicago, Illinois SPOUSES: Jeri Caldwell (1957-1966), Ulla Andersson (1967-1974), and Peggy Lipton (1974-1990) CHILDREN: Jolie, Rachel, Quincy III, Martina, Rashida , Kidada, and Kenya ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces Young Quincy Jones Quincy Delight Jones Jr. was born on March 14, 1933, in Chicago. His mother, Sarah Frances Jones, worked at a bank, and his father, Quincy Delight Jones Sr., was a carpenter and semi-professional baseball player. Quincy spent his early years in Chicago with his parents and younger brother, Lloyd. After his parents divorced and his mother developed a schizophrenic disorder, he and his brother were sent to live with their paternal grandmother in Louisville, Kentucky. At age 10, Quincy Sr. moved his sons to Bremerton, Washington, outside of Seattle. There, young Quincy gained a stepmother, Elvera, and three step-siblings: Waymond, Theresa, and Katherine. His father and stepmother had three more children together—Jeanette, Margie, and Richard—and later moved the family to Seattle. Drawn to music at an early age, Quincy Jr. first touched a piano at recreation center when he was 11 years old, which inspired him to join school choir and band, where he learned to play multiple brass, reed, and percussion instruments. He was later recruited to play in a swing band formed by his classmate. After he graduated from Garfield High School in 1950, Quincy studied at Seattle University for one semester before transferring to Berklee College of Music in Boston. Musician, Producer, and Composer Despite receiving a scholarship to attend the prestigious Berklee College, Jones dropped out after Lionel Hampton invited him on tour with his band. Jones played trumpet and arranged for Hampton from 1951 to 1953. He then worked as a freelance arranger on many jazz sessions. He served as musical director for Dizzy Gillespie ’s overseas big-band tour in 1956, worked for Barclay Records in Paris from 1957 to 1958, and led an all-star big band for the 1959 European production of Harold Arlen’s blues opera Free and Easy . Getty Images Quincy Jones led a big band early in his career before becoming an award-winning music producer and composer. After returning to New York, Jones composed and arranged for Frank Sinatra ’s 1964 album It Might As Well Be Swing , which featured the hit “Fly Me to the Moon.” That same year, he won his first Grammy Award for his arrangement of Count Basie ’s “I Can’t Stop Loving You.” At the time, he was working at Mercury Records as the label’s first Black vice president while simultaneously producing his own increasingly pop-oriented records. In the mid-1960s, Jones began composing for movies and television, eventually producing over 50 scores and serving as a trailblazing Black musician in the Hollywood arena. He earned his first two of seven total Oscar nominations for scoring In Cold Blood and crafting the song “The Eyes of Love,” with lyricist Bob Russell, from Banning . Both movies released in 1967. His solo Emmy Award recognized his score for the 1977 limited series Roots , based on Alex Haley ’s novel of the same name. In 1970, Jones won another Grammy for his jazz-funk album Walking in Space , taking home the trophy for Best Jazz Ensemble Album. In total, Jones won a whopping 28 Grammy wins out of 80 nominations. He is among the most nominated artists in Grammy history and ranks third for most trophies won by an individual, behind Beyoncé and conductor Georg Solti. After producing Aretha Franklin ’s 1973 album Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky) , he went out on his own to start a record label. In 1975, Jones founded Qwest Productions, for which he arranged and produced hugely successful albums by major jazz and pop figures, including Frank Sinatra . Jones later established Qwest Records as a joint venture with Warner Bros. Records. The first release under the label was George Benson’s Give Me the Night (1980). Getty Images Michael Jackson and producer Quincy Jones won several Grammy Awards for the singer’s 1982 album, Thriller . In 1978, Jones produced the soundtrack for The Wiz , the musical adaptation of The Wizard of Oz that starred Diana Ross as Dorothy. Michael Jackson portrayed the scarecrow as Nipsey Russell and Ted Ross rounded out the foursome, portraying the tin man and lion respectively. Meeting Jackson led to what was perhaps his most fruitful professional collaboration. Jones produced the pop singer’s breakthrough solo album Off the Wall in 1979 as well as Jackson’s acclaimed follow-up Thriller . The 1982 album resulted in six Grammy trophies and remains the best-selling record of all-time. As a movie and TV producer, his most successful projects were the 1985 film The Color Purple— directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Whoopi Goldberg , Oprah Winfrey , and Danny Glover—as well as the 1990s television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , starring Will Smith . The Color Purple was nominated for Best Picture at the 58 th Academy Awards. In 1985, Jones used his clout among major American recording artists to record the much-celebrated anthem “We Are the World” to raise money for victims of famine in Ethiopia. His work on behalf of social causes spanned his career, including the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation, which built more than 100 homes in South Africa in 2001. The charity aimed to connect youths with technology, education, culture, and music and sponsored an intercultural exchange between teens in Los Angeles and South Africa. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Jones with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1994 for his philanthropic work. Ex-Wives and Children Jones was married three times. His first marriage was to Jeri Caldwell from 1957 to 1966; they had one daughter together named Jolie. Jones was then married to Ulla Andersson, with whom he shares a son, Quincy III, and a daughter, Martina, from 1967 to 1974. Jones’ final marriage was to actor Peggy Lipton . The pair were married from 1974 to 1990, and they had two daughters, Kidada and Rashida Jones, who is a popular actor and filmmaker. He also had two daughters, Rachel and Kenya, from other relationships. Keep Reading Rashida Jones’ Bond with Her Father, Quincy Jones Other Ventures and Controversies Beyond music and the screen, Jones published the magazines Vibe and SPIN . In 1990, he formed Quincy Jones Entertainment, a co-venture with Time Warner Inc. Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones was published in 2001. In September 2018, a documentary entitled Quincy was released by Netflix. The movie was co-directed by his daughter, actor Rashida Jones. In a GQ interview published in early 2018, the music icon said he liked contemporary artists like Bruno Mars , Drake , and Kendrick Lamar but admitted he was no fan of Taylor Swift ’s music, saying, “We need more songs, man. F—ing songs, not hooks.” He raised more eyebrows with comments from another interview published in Vulture around the same time, alleging that Michael Jackson “stole a lot of songs” and that Marlon Brando and Richard Pryor had slept together. The legendary producer released a statement shortly afterward in which he apologized for “bad-mouthing” others, signing off with: “I encourage you all to please grow with me & keep on keepin’ on. Love, an 85-year-old bow-legged man who is still learning from his mistakes.” ﻿Death Jones died on November 3, 2024, at age 91. He was at his Bel Air, California, home when he died. “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing,” his family said in a statement ﻿. “Although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.” Just hours before his death, Jones had wished his daughter Martina a happy birthday via Instagram , writing, “So proud to be yo papa! Big hug, I love you eternally.” ﻿A 7-time Oscar nominee, Jones was set to receive an honorary Academy Award for life achievement later in November. The celebrated musician and record producer’s cause of death was later revealed to be pancreatic cancer ﻿.﻿﻿ Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

Our Vision: Our vision is a revitalized and vibrant Quincy downtown district that is a destination for visitors and a source of pride for area residents. ABOUT MAIN STREET What is the History of the Main Street Program? The National Main Street Center, a private, non-profit organization, was established by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1980 to stimulate economic development within a context of historic preservation. The Florida Main Street program was established in 1985. Administered by the Department of State, Bureau of Historic Preservation, it provides technical assistance to Florida’s 43 active Main Street communities for their traditional historic commercial corridors. Quincy’s first Main Street program was formed in 1987, making it one of Florida’s original Main Street communities. Today Quincy Main Street, Inc. is moving forward as a private, non-profit organization formed by interested citizens and dedicated local residents and professionals concerned about the economic viability of the downtown district and possessing a desire to see a revitalized Quincy downtown as a destination for visitors and source of community pride for area residents. Why Worry About Downtown? Main Street U.S.A. was the birthplace of American enterprise and the center of economic and social activity for the community. After World War II a more mobile society abandoned historic downtowns for suburbs and the creation of the Interstate Highway system along with the advent of shopping malls and super-stores left many downtown communities by the wayside. But that is all changing! Throughout the United States historic downtowns are being restored and becoming destinations among themselves. Shoppers are looking for that unique and “authentic” experience and shopping malls that once spent millions to recreate the feel of the traditional Main Street are dying. No new enclosed mall has been built since 2006 and it is predicted that half of all malls will close in the next 10 years. The Main Street Approach Across the nation, small cities are discovering that the “Main Street” approach can bring about dramatic, positive change downtown. As a unique preservation-based economic development tool, the Main Street Four Point Approach® is the foundation for local initiatives to revitalize their districts by leveraging local assets—from cultural or architectural heritage to local enterprises and community pride. This approach advocates improvements in four areas to create a distinctive image for downtown: Economic Vitality Improving the economic base of downtown by strengthening existing businesses, recruiting new businesses, performing market analysis and encouraging second floor commercial and/or residential use. Design Encouraging quality building rehabilitation, signage, public improvements and façade improvements to improve the appearance of downtown. Promotion Creating and marketing a positive image of downtown through special events, retail sales, effective advertising and public relations. Organization Working with public and private sector community leaders to develop and coordinate resources to revitalize downtown. Guiding Principals The National Main Street Center’s experience in helping communities bring their commercial corridors back to life has shown time and time again that the Main Street Four-Point Approach succeeds. That success is guided by following eight principles, which set the Main Street methodology apart from other redevelopment strategies. For a Main Street program to be successful, it must whole-heartedly embrace the time-tested Eight Principles. As a Main Street America™ Accredited program, QUINCY MAIN STREET is a recognized leading program among the national network of more than 1,200 neighborhoods and communities who share both a commitment to creating high-quality places and to building stronger communities through preservation-based economic development. All Main Street America™ Accredited programs meet a set of National Accreditation Standards of Performance as outlined by the National Main Street Center. NON-DISCRIMINATION AND ACCESSIBILITY QMS shall be an open and inclusive organization that shall not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, ability, age, religion, color, creed, and national origin or upon any other unlawful basis.
