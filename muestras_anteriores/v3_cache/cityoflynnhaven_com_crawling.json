I am a husband of 20 years and a proud father of two girls. As the owner of Beef O’Brady’s, right in the heart of Lynn Haven, I’ve had the honor to meet so many families, giving me insight into what Lynn Haven’s families need. Year after year, I have supported many children’s sports activities by sponsoring teams, donating food and supporting their fundraising activities. Lynn Haven is a community that is built on families and as your commissioner, you can rest assured that each and every day I will put families first. Together we need to be aggressive in bringing quality of life attractions to the City. Our sports leagues need to be second to none and parks need to have plenty of space for children to enjoy themselves. Our parks and sports facilities were devastated by the storm and we need to work to get those facilities operational for everyone to enjoy. I believe in taking care of our seniors and I fully support the Senior Activity Club. It is great to know that they are taken care of and their needs are met, physically and socially. I look forward to the challenge of redesigning the City to be proud of for generations to come. While we rebuild, we need to take a proactive approach to preparing for new growth and defining what we want the new Lynn Haven to look like, including City Hall, the police department, library, etc. I believe we need to build partnerships with our large employers in Lynn Haven to make sure they remain viable for our citizen’s workforce needs. Having good industry and jobs will allow our children to one day raise their families in Lynn Haven in a flourishing environment.

(WJHG/WECP) - Get ready to play ball because construction is now underway for the Lynn Haven Sports Complex. The complex was torn to pieces more than three years ago during Hurricane Michael. “Hurricane Michael destroyed much of what was out here. this was a 428 project using FEMA money so it took a while for us to go through the process with FEMA and the insurance to get all of this together,” Parks & Grounds Director Ty Farris said. It may be tractors and dirt right now, but that won’t be the case in Spring 2023. “It’ll be for soccer, football. North Bay Haven currently had a lacrosse team so who knows maybe they’ll end up practicing out here as well,” Farris said. “It will have two courts that will be strived for basketball, volleyball, and pickleball. That seems to be the latest craze that everybody likes. And there are future plans for a skatepark here as well.” Construction on the baseball and multipurpose fields began roughly a month ago. Park officials said they have been thrown a few curveballs in the process. “With our baseball fields right now, we’re looking at eight to ten weeks out on stormwater pipe, just infrastructure materials. and that’s hard for the course these days just with supply chain issues,” Farris said. Even with a few strikeouts, Farris said it’s worth the wait. “The youth are kind of all spread out right now at different locations playing different sports. I think that when we get the complex up and running, this is going to end up turning into a central hub for recreational sports,” Farris said. Copyright 2022 WJHG. All rights reserved.

News Former Lynn Haven City Manager, Community Services Director, Greenleaf owner arrested by: S. Brady Calhoun Posted: Nov 19, 2019 / 09:13 AM CST Updated: Mar 26, 2021 / 12:23 PM CDT by: S. Brady Calhoun Posted: Nov 19, 2019 / 09:13 AM CST Updated: Mar 26, 2021 / 12:23 PM CDT SHARE Federal authorities charged five people Tuesday morning including the former city manager of Lynn Haven, a Lynn Haven employee and the owners of two local businesses who performed services for the city following Hurricane Michael. INDICTMENT Download CHARGES Download Lynn Haven and Bay County officials react to indictments Mike White All of the individuals named in the indictment are charged with several counts of fraud and money laundering for a total of $5 million. They are: Mike White, the former city manager of Lynn Haven, Lynn Haven Community Services Director David Horton, Greenleaf Lawncare Owner Josh Anderson, Erosion Control Specialist Owner David Mitchelle White and Erosion Control Specialist employee Shannon Rodriguez. Josh Anderson Current City Manager Vickie Gainer emailed a statement about the arrest Tuesday. “The city continues to gather information at the same pace this investigation is taking place,” Gainer wrote. “Mr. David Horton, has been charged with allegations of criminal activity.  Mr. Horton has been suspended without pay until the city has had the opportunity to review the allegations.  The vendor in question, Greenleaf Lawn of Care performed lawn care services for the city.   In light of the allegations with Greenleaf Lawn Care, the city will be reviewing their contract for possible termination.” READ MORE: LYNN HAVEN SERVED WITH SUBPOENAS Shannon Rodriguez The indictment states that Anderson submitted false invoices to the city for payment. Mike White, approved Erosion Control Specialists invoices and then directed city employees to immediately pay ECS for those invoices, even though other contracted debris removal companies had to wait for payment of invoices submitted for Hurricane Michael disaster relief and debris removal. Erosion Control Specialists, which worked for Lynn Haven after Hurricane Michael was not licensed in Florida to do contracting, electrical, or plumbing work and held no business license in the state. READ MORE: CONCERNS ABOUT EROSION CONTROL SPECIALISTS “In the first month of its contract (November 2017) Joshua Daniel Anderson and Greenleaf submitted a request for payment to Lynn Haven under the contract for $277,372.80.” Horton and Mike White approved invoices submitted by Erosion Control Specialists for work “allegedly” performed by ECS for Hurricane Michael clean up. Horton also approved ECS timesheets and “falsely verified” the attendance of ECS employees at various claimed work locations, the indictment states. It adds that Horton accepted payment for some of his travel, lodging, meals, entertainment, and food from David Mitchelle White on a number of occasions. READ MORE: LYNN HAVEN EMERGENCY MEETING ABOUT MIKE WHITE The indictment adds that Horton also had David White and ECS provide debris removal and repair to his home, the indictment said. That work was paid for by the City of Lynn Haven, prosecutors wrote. Horton then requested and obtained an invoice for the services provided at his home which he then submitted to his insurance company for payment, they added. Horton may not be the only person connected to Lynn Haven to do this. The indictment states that ECS submitted to Lynn Haven for payment of services that were not authorized under the emergency contract and were for personal residences of some Lynn Haven officials. The indictment states that along with Horton, work was also done at Mike White’s home and his farm outside the city limits. The private home of Mayor Margo Anderson and her mother. The private gated community of a city commissioner, Dan Russell. Russell is not named in the indictment but the indictment names the community where the work was done as Osceola Point. According to the Supervisor of Election’s Office Russell lives in Osceola Point. ECS also did clean up work at the private home of Lynn Haven City Attorney Adam Albritton and others as directed by Albritton, the indictment states. “I have been asked not to comment on the events of today as it is part of an ongoing criminal investigation,” Albritton wrote in a statement to News 13. “For now, all I can say is that to the best of my abilities, at all times I have honestly and faithfully fulfilled my responsibilities as the City Attorney for Lynn Haven.” Shannon Rodriguez, David White’s sister, supervised a crew of ECS workers and maintained timesheets for the workers that were then submitted to Lynn Haven for payment, according to the indictment. “After the initial declaration of an emergency by Lynn Haven had been revoked and expired, Michael Edward White and David Wayne Horton sought to locate additional Lynn Haven projects that could provide money to David Mitchelle White and ECS,” the indictment states They accomplished this task by hiring ECS to conduct trash pick-up at $300 per hour per crew. “This action was implemented despite the ability of Lynn Haven waste trucks to pick-up large amounts of household trash and deposit large amounts of trash at the dump at no increased cost to Lynn Haven,” the indictment states. They also had ECS employees wrap Christmas gifts, prepare locations for a Halloween party, and other miscellaneous acts that were not authorized under any agreement with Lynn Haven. ECS billed $35 per hour for employees and $90 per hour for supervisors for these “unauthorized activities.” “In Late December of 2018, David Mitchelle White paid for a week-long trip to the Gatlinburg, Tennessee area for David Wayne Horton and his family, Joshua Daniel Anderson and his family, Shannon Delores Rodriguez and her family, a Bay County commissioner and his family,” the indictment states. The trip cost David White more than $25,000 for lodging meals, entertainment and rental vehicles for the two public officials.

White was the monies paid by Lynn Haven Bay County Commissioner Keith Baker released a statement following the press conference. Erosion Control Specialists is not a past or present vendor of Bay County. In December of 2018, as a newly elected county commissioner, I was unaware of the requirements regarding reporting of gifts by elected officials. I did accept a trip to Tennessee and will take immediate steps to rectify my failure to report that gift with the state Ethics Commission.” Keith Baker Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

(WJHG/WECP) - The commission voted to allow architects to design the Lynn Haven Sports Complex in different phases to allow the commission and the community to review the designs before they go out for a bid and then built it. The commission also approved to move forward with phase 1, which is the 5-baseball field portion of the sports complex. Officials say the project could cost around $4 million. “We’re going to do the ball fields first and infrastructure last,” said Lynn Haven Commissioner Judy Tinder. “We’re gonna come back before the commission between each phase so we can approve the funding and to make sure we have it.” City leaders also approved to delay cut off of utilities for residents until October. City officials say they are planning to set up a program similar to Panama City’s Local Housing Assistance Program to offer those residents struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic utility assistance. “We wanted to give them that opportunity to get them caught up on some of their utility billing,” said Lynn Haven City Manager Vickie Gainer. “One of the things we’re gonna be doing is contacting these residents and telling them this program is available .” The commission also approved Florida Architects to begin designs on city hall and chamber facilities. Officials say the architects are restricted to design a 16,000 square foot building at no more than $310 a square yard. Copyright 2020 WJHG. All rights reserved.
