O’Malley is a recognized national expert in primary care health services research, with a strong background in primary care conceptualization and measurement and mixed-methods research. She is dedicated to improving the evidence base and providing expertise on how to best support high-quality primary care in the United States. O’Malley is the Deputy Project Director of the Evaluation of the Making Care Primary model (MCP) Run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, MCP is a value-based care multi-payer model that builds on the lessons of prior primary care models such as Primary Care First and Comprehensive Primary Care Plus. O'Malley was the principal investigator on the evaluation of the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) model which ended in 2021. In addition to leading the implementation team evaluating MCP, and previously CPC+, she is involved in the breadth and depth of research for this evaluation. This includes development, analyses, and summarizing findings from surveys of patients, physicians, and practices; qualitative site visits and phone interviews of practitioners, staff, and patients; analyses of claims data; and distilling these data into clinical and policy-relevant findings. O’Malley also led development of two new Medicare claims-based measures of the comprehensiveness of primary care physicians and practices. In addition, she co-led an evaluation of the Impact and Diffusion of the Chronic Care Management fee for the Innovation Center. O’Malley has been principal investigator or project director on grants from the Commonwealth Fund, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health (National Cancer Institute). Topics covered included improving supports for primary care, continuity and coordination of care, after-hours care, use of electronic health records for care coordination, primary care teamwork, and hospital employment of physicians. Throughout this work, Ann has interacted with health policy decision makers, committees within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Innovation Center. O’Malley has served on advisory committees for organizations including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, the American Board of Internal Medicine, and the American Academy of Family Practitioners. She has also published numerous peer-review articles and presented at many national meetings. O’Malley is board certified in preventive medicine and public health, has clinical training in pediatrics and preventive medicine, and is a fellow of the American College of Preventive Medicine. She also completed a National Research Service Award fellowship in primary care research.

Meet Kelli Proprietor: Kelli Meacham Kelli is a lifelong resident of St. Augustine. After 16 years of service as a St. Johns County Deputy, Kelli started her own business and is now the proud owner of Ann O’Malley’s Pub. Kelli’s loves are animals, the beach, and this city. Her favorite place on the planet is the St. Augustine bayfront. Kelli is also a huge Gators Fan, so on any given Saturday in the fall you can be assured that the Gator game will be on the “Big” TV! Good Music, great food, and cold beer are always here at O’Malley’s.  Come on out and hang with Kelli and the gang on the porch. To Kelli, this is not a business, it’s her family. Come on in and let us be your home away from home! Our Story Over the Years ^ 1878 Built as a family home Home to A.B. Colee . His family started the St. Augustine Transfer Company. Then a way to get to St. Augustine from Picolata. Today a horse carriage company. ^ 1992 Opened as Ann O’Malley’s Pub Named after the original owners step mother-in-law, Ann O’Malley’s soon became the favorite of the locals in St. Augustine. ^ 2017 Kelli Took Over Ownership After changing hands a number of times, Kelli took over ownership of the pub and made it into what it is today. Ann O’Malley’s was voted Best Pub in St. Augustine by Folio Weekly in 2019. ^ 2021 We made it through the Pandemic! When other pubs and restaurants were forced to close permanently, Ann O’Malley’s stood strong and is back better than ever! Come and see for yourself.
