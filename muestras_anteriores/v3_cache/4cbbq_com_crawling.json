Barbeque Nation At a time when restaurant brands are at a rush in opening and then shutting down stores, how one brand has stood the test of time by never closing even a single store? To know the best practices of this company, which runs more than 100 stores on its own, we reached out to Kayum Dhanani, Managing Director, Barbeque Nation Hospitality. Interestingly, Kayum was never the real owner of the brand Barbeque Nation. The story goes back to 2006, when his brother Sajid Dhanani, who ran the well-known Sayaji Hotels in Indore, once came across customers complaining of cold appetizers, during winters. He thought of experimenting by bringing \"live grill' on the customer's table. Sajid was popular in Indore for doing things differently. Buffets were always there in five-star hotels, but live grill picked up as a concept. With this, it gave him the confidence of taking the concept out of the hotel and establishing it as an individual restaurant. The first one came up in Mumbai's Pali Hills. And, soon, 18 more stores were added across the nation. However, with the sudden demise of Sajid in 2012, his brother Kayum took over Barbeque Nation and led to its growth in India and overseas. Here are the Reasons why the Biggest Indian Casual Dining Chain Never saw a Single Shutdown Keeping the Rent to Revenue in Control Over the years, Barbeque Nation has become a favorite place for celebrations, that's why you will find group tables at all outlets, rather than a table for two. With the bookings done by professionals and that too in advance, 70 per cent of their tables are always pre-booked. In fact, their rent to revenue ratio is 10 percent lower compared to other casual dining setups, as Barbeque Nation doesn't look for a location which is most prominent. You can find an outlet in the third lane or on the third floor of a mall, instead of high streets. Customer is King From 20-25 per cent of tables the feedback is taken within 24 hours. It is incorporated in a text and sent to all the teams across the country. Hence, all the team members are aware of what their customers are talking about – good or bad. So within subsequent 24 hours, they have to correct their operations. According to Dhanani, \"Every team member, even from faraway places like Guwahati or Jammu, can login with a password and read the message. This way, it is easier to operate.\" They use their \"Guest Satisfaction Index' feature to improvise their services further. If a customer is unsatisfied, from the manager to the CEO everyone comes to know about it. In order to recover the guest, the Regional Manager personally talks to him to understand the problem he faced. If that doesn't work, the CEO steps in to fix it. Move Beyond Metros In FY 2017-2018, the brand opened 23 stores. Till 2016, they had mostly focused in metros and tier – 1 cities. Hence, they designed a different model for tier III and the lower end of tier II towns. Metro stores are about 4,500 to 6,000 sq.ft, however, in the tier II and the tier III markets, they are eager to give them the status of an anchor brand. \"They offer us the best positions in the malls and that too at a discounted rate. In the tier II towns, rent to revenue ratio is about six- seven per cent. In absolute percentage, the margins are quite similar. For the next five years, we will be extremely busy consuming these markets,\" shares Dhanani. QSR Approach in Casual Dining In Delhi, the Barbeque Nation has a central kitchen. \"Products and marinades are supplied by our cold chain at the central kitchen. However, the marination and the grilling happen at the outlet kitchens. This way our dependency on the chefs has also reduced because the process doesn't need very high-quality chefs because all they have to do is assembling and dispensing the food. It makes our supply chain more efficient, eventually helping us to expand to more locations,\" says Dhanani. Glocal Approach Every trade area is a different market, hence this national brand prefer to call itself as global yet local. \"For an outlet to become successful, we need to have a strong idea of the trade area and which products fit in with its culture. In Lucknow, when we started off, our store was not doing very well. Initially, we were serving them the products that were popular in Mumbai. Eventually, we realized that people there don't' like our biriyani. To correct this, we hired a local chef who understands the local taste. And, it clicked for us,\" shares Dhanani. No Shutdown Command As per Dhanani, Barbeque Nation didn't close a single store in the last 12 years. \"We have been successful in every store. Today, 95 per cent of our stores are profitable, only the 5 per cent which are fairly new are yet to reach profitability. At Barbeque Nation, break-even typically happens in six months and from then on, we become \"store level' profitable,\" claims Dhanani. International Expansion For international expansion, they have set up their entire base in Dubai, shares Dhanani. They are reaching out to the Middle East and North Africa and then planning further expansions in South East Asia and North America. \"We first go to a region and open one store. That's the phase 1, this lets us understand the market and learn. In the second phase, we open three to six stores. Once the proof-of-concept is ready, we ideate a bigger expansion, like a five-year plan,\" exudes Dhanani further adding, \"In the Middle East, the yield from every cover is almost double. Our average cover price in India is around Rs 750. In the Middle East, it is Rs 1350. Our rent to revenue ratio is also 12 per cent. The margins are much better. About 60-70 per cent of the middle eastern countries have no tax.\" Going forward, the brand is looking at Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Malaysia.

As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. Full policy . Who is Destination BBQ and What Can We Do for You? Destination: BBQ began in the summer of 2012 as a simple family blog covering our “Summer BBQ Tour,” as you can read below in what was the very first post on this site. We are still the Roller family from Mount Pleasant: Heather and Jim and our kids: Christian, Chelsea, and Camden. Because all the kids have now graduated, Heather and Jim remain the primary voices as we have been since that first post. Christian, Chelsea, and Camden (yes, all Cs) have moved out on their own, but we hope to include their voices any time they join us on a trip. Since then, we’ve evolved from simply writing about our dining experiences to covering all things SC BBQ. Our goal is to help people find great SC barbecue and to help SC barbecue find great people. Like to Help Us? If you’d like to help us with that endeavor, we’re always grateful for help of any sort. “How can I help,” you’re thinking? Well, it can be as simple as just writing in to share your thoughts on ways to improve the site; constructive criticism is always welcome. Or even by finding things you like on this site and sharing them on social media, pinning images on Pinterest, or signing up for Grow . If you’re up for it, I’d be grateful if you would check the map to look for BBQ joints in your area (or beyond). Maybe there is a new one you’ve seen that I haven’t added or there’s an old one that’s recently closed or has other info I need to update. Maybe click into a few listings to see if you can spot errors of any sort. Whatever you spot, send that info on to me . For those with more time and desire, I could use volunteers to help test and photograph recipes . I have a small group of volunteers who have worked independently testing recipes for the cookbook and whose feedback has been invaluable. Always happy for more volunteers. If you’re a writer , I always have need for some light research and/or writing to do. For instance, as I write this, I have about 25 restaurants I need to write up and add to the map. Or if you’re up for bigger projects, I’d welcome help there, too. Don’t have time or feel you have the right set of skills? There is another option. Become an SCBBQ Patron and assist by helping us fund additional features or hire freelancers to help add content to the site. Or maybe, you have your own thoughts on ways you’d be comfortable contributing. I welcome all input. Feel free to share your thoughts. With your help, we can make a good thing even better. Hope to hear from you . Now, on the site, you’ll find: 1) An events calendar , covering BBQ festivals and competitions across the state. 2) You’ll find our amazing Interstate Road Guide which shows you all the SC BBQ restaurants within a few miles of an interstate exit. 3) We are especially proud of our SC BBQ Locator Map . Find all the SCBBQ restaurants in the vicinity or search for any part of the state. Even filter your search to show only those that serve Mustard sauces or those who take credit/debit cards. 4) Don’t miss out on our Authentic SCBBQ Recipes . Learn more about our cookbook: SCBBQ Recipes: Going Whole Hog . We invite you to Sub mit Your Own Recipes for others to enjoy as well. 4) And of course, it all began with our Restaurant Reviews . In addition, there is more planned as we continue our evolution: a page featuring every SC BBQ restaurant, SC BBQ recipes and cooking tips, competition coverage, equipment reviews, and more will be featured in time. In order to keep up, we invite you to keep up with our site by joining our mailing list or following us on Facebook or Twitter . As of the time of this writing, we have been featured in The Free-Times in Columbia and The Herald Independent from Winnsboro. The State will be adding us to their Local Food Blog. Heather and Jim recently became members of the SC Barbeque Association and took our first steps to become official SCBA certified judges. We hope this will help us serve the SC BBQ community and help us develop an even better BBQ palate to provide you with more professional commentary. Already impressed with our work, Lake High, president of the SCBA, has asked us to help the SCBA by providing reviews for their site as well. In the end, our focus will remain focused on doing all we can to help readers with all things SC BBQ. Legal Note: In April 2022, we formed an LLC. Today, the site is owned by and operated by H & J Enterprises of Charleston, LLC, DBA Destination BBQ. The Post That Started It All Hello world and welcome to our summer tour. Our family has decided to embark on a tour of notable BBQ joints in and around the Lowcountry of South Carolina. Destination BBQ is our simple blog designed to capture our experiences during each our of stops. Who are we? We are the Rollers from Mt. Pleasant, SC: Jim, Heather, Christian, Chelsea, and Camden (and Dixie, too). We don’t pretend to be connoisseurs or experts in the field. We simply enjoy good food, and really like good BBQ. Simply put, it is our intention to provide our subjective opinions of what we experience. Good, bad, or just ok. We’re not food critics, we’re not expert pitmasters. We are who we are: just an average family. But if you want a true, honest, unbiased opinion of what we experienced on a given day, that we can provide. Therefore, tomorrow we begin. Recently, Heather read an article in Southern Living about Scott’s BBQ in Hemingway, SC . (Supposedly, it is one of the best in the South. We shall see.) And this is what sparked us to begin our journey. So Friday, June 8, 2012, we set out for Hemingway on the first steps of a trip that will lead us we know not where. Come along for the ride… Δ Bobby Smith Friday 5th of April 2024 order a Gone but not forgotten TShirt of Jackie Hite & order came today & the TShirt  I got was Southern Shrimp & Grits I dont even eat shrimp & grits Please send me the shirt that I order Bobby Smith 105 Drawdebil Road Gilbert, SC 29054 Iorder the shirt on 4/2/2024 James Roller Friday 5th of April 2024 @Bobby Smith, yikes...I am looking into it now. Robby Bennett Thursday 25th of January 2024 Jim, my name is Robby Bennett and I live in Cheraw SC. One of my close friends just gave me a copy of your book Going Whole Hog. We love pulled pork and good vinegar based sauces.  I graduated HS in 72 and came back to work for our family business Bennett Motor Co just across hey 9 from the Burlington textile. I also played golf with Jim Roller who I think worked in textiles. Was that your dad? Anyway would love to talk to you at some point and see if there is something our Cheraw Arts Commission could get you up here to promote your book and bbq. Thanks Robby James Roller Friday 26th of January 2024 Hey @Robby Bennett, yep...that's my dad! A JP Stevens guy while in there. I will tell him you reached out. Being from Cheraw, I would expect nothing less than a love for pulled pork with a great vinegar sauce. Having grown up there, it will always remain my preference.  As for a book event, I appreciate the thought, but not my cup of tea. I didn't really do it for recognition (actually I probably wouldn't have done it knowing that was part of the package), but thank you for the offer. This was just supposed to be a little something I put together for maybe a couple of hundred readers and had extra for those who came along in the future, but then it sort of blew up. Never expected all this. Thanks and Go Braves! Gerald Bridges Monday 10th of October 2022 Is or will the cookbook be available in print version ? James Roller Wednesday 18th of October 2023 @Laura King, Hmm...I will reach out to you via email and Etsy messenger and we'll see if we can connect. The odds are that there is no problem to begin with regarding your address. It's just that we have time before they arrive and I thought a double-check in the interim couldn't hurt. I've actually caught a couple of problems as a result, so that's good. Laura King Tuesday 17th of October 2023 @James Roller, I keep getting emails to confirm my address for the book. None of them seem to go back to you. Please help! 😊 James Roller Monday 10th of October 2022 @Gerald Bridges, just replied to your FB post. Will copy answer below: I am working on that now, actually. Hope to have it ready by the holiday season. We'll see, but yes, I plan to have the option for a print version of what will be a much-expanded version of the original. Here is a copy of the current draft's table of contents (may/will change by final version).

Follow & Contact Uwe Dorst Partner | Master of Engineering and Business Administration Successful mediators are usually familiar with both sides of a problem. Uwe Dorst is such an intermediary. As an industrial engineer, he throws both weights his technical understanding as well as equally extensive expertise in business administration into the balance of his consulting work. A virtue extremely beneficial when orchestrating optimization and transformation initiatives. Particularly when it is executed in his typical style: quietly, calmly and deliberately.\r\n\r\nUwe Dorst has outstanding experience in financial services and business transformation. He focuses on IT strategy, modernization of IT platforms, sourcing management, processing and operations, digitization and project governance/management. Areas of Expertise Governance, Resilience & Innovation CEO/COO Advisory Transformation, De-risking & Technology Strategy, Business Model & Management Digital Transformation Follow & Contact Stephan Grunwald Senior Partner | Master of Economics and Business Administration For Stephan Grunwald, consulting is an entrepreneurial activity with many variations; in various industries, for companies of different sizes, in different management structures. Yet always with the same sense of entrepreneurship. The prerequisite for all this is a sound and broadly diversified foundation in business administration. For him, however, the consistent realization of a concept is the ultimate entrepreneurial aspect of consulting differentiating 4C GROUP from its competition.\r\n\r\nHis focus lies in the CFO Advisory covering all aspects of decision making and controlling, reporting & planning, cost management, new role of finance (Industry 4.0), HR digitization and innovation management.\r\n\r\nHe has extensive experience in various industries and consulting of owner-managed and family led companies. Areas of Expertise ESG Transformation Demographic Shift Finance Transformation Performance Management and Controlling Accounting Excellence CFO Advisory Follow & Contact Hans-Martin Schneider Senior Partner | Master of Business Administration An absolute intention to change things for the better is part of every 4C consultant’s essential mindset.

This is also how he understands his consulting approach. In doing so, he puts the customer in focus. He asks himself how processes can be aligned with customers in such a way that maximum added value is created for them. And how organisations have to adapt and handle necessary change as a result. He is driven by passion and positive thinking. He says, \"it's always about people!\". Only those who take people along on the business expedition and show genuine interest in them will be able to effect change.\r\nPatrick combines more than 20 years of sales experience in various management roles in financial services and consumer goods with many years of consulting experience. His focus is on the development of sustainable and resilient business and sales models, holistic customer centricity of organization through digitalization and transformation, and overall sales excellence. Areas of Expertise Sales Excellence Future Proof Business Model CSO Advisory Follow & Contact Dr. Manuel Iserloh Senior Partner | Doctor of Medical Sciences, Master of Engineering and Business Administration Planning and decision making, organizational development or down-to-earth change management – in these disciplines 4C consultants develop profound competences.

For Manuel Iserloh, a passionate mountaineer, there is a close parallel: success depends on individual capabilities and team cooperation.\r\n\r\nHe has outstanding experience in the healthcare sector focusing on strategy development, digitization, decision making, process optimization, change management and restructuring. Areas of Expertise Hospital of tomorrow Follow & Contact Dr. Heiko Mauterer Senior Partner | Master of Engineering and Business Administration In consulting creating benefit for a customer is considered to be a given. In practice, this is not necessarily the case. At least according to Dr. Heiko Mauterer's experience in several management positions in banking. Creating true value is a key concept for him, that determines his thinking as well as his work with his clients. If applicable, all benefit aspects - in his eyes - are to be quantified and made measurable. And that's also not self-evident.\r\n\r\nHeiko Mauterer has outstanding experience in financial services and focuses on regulatory management, Human Resources, digitization, operations and project management. Areas of Expertise ESG Transformation Demographic Shift CHRO Advisory People Strategy & Insights HR Digitization HR Transformation Human Capital Reporting - certification services Follow & Contact Markus Noçon Senior Partner | Diplom-Wirtschaftsingenieur “People, who really want to move things forward” – are the ones Markus Noçon wants to work with. We are happily quoting Markus, since it expresses a central consulting challenge. Namely, mastering the balancing act between corporate decision-making concepts on the one hand and a pragmatic implementation of methods and instruments on the other. This works best with partners on the client, side who want and actively drive change.\r\n\r\nHis main focus lies within the CFO Advisory, especially in group accounting and consolidation, controlling & reporting, planning as well as performance management systems and consolidation systems.\r\n\r\nHe has extensive experience in many industries.
