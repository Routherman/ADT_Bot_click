The staff are very nice and welcoming. 10/10 I recommended going here if your in the Oviedo area. Review by - Google five star review by Jolt 7800: We went to the District Eat and Play for the first time and it is really epic. We went for the Free Play Florida retro event and had a great time. The great selection of pinball games were our favorite thing to do, but there is something for everyone. I definitely look forward to going back soon. Clean place and friendly staff! A huge place with a lot of options; being in the mall gives it the extra \"something\". Review by - Google five star review by Colleen G.: Such a fun family spot! So glad we found it for our mommy son date night. The staff was so helpful and the food was excellent! We will return again when in central Florida.

When Faye, our founder, realised just how much heat from industry goes to waste, it got her thinking. Combined with her love for all things food and farming, it didn’t take long to connect the dots – what if we used waste heat and CO 2 for greenhouses?\n\nIn 2019, Faye set up District Eating to explore the low carbon horticulture concept further. Since then, we have grown into a team of experienced engineers and consultants, united by our belief in a better food system.\n\nIn 2022, we were recognised as the Best Green Start Up in the Start Up Awards, marking our achievements in the first few years of our journey. And this is only the beginning! We can’t wait to see what the future holds as we continue to grow our team and work towards our vision of low-carbon greenhouses. Our Mission We want to transform food production whilst providing viable uses for waste resources. We Aim To: Create local food networks that work better for people and the planet Add social value to communities through jobs, training, health, and wellbeing Find win-win solutions that make business sense Make use of waste resources and develop circular economy solutions Our Team Faye Tomson BEng CEM MEI​ Founder and Director About Faye An experienced energy and environmental engineer, Faye has over 11 years’ experience working throughout the UK on large scale energy infrastructure projects. Faye comes from a family of Yorkshire farmers and believes we should be producing more of our food closer to home.

Home About Us Our Locations Greenville Appleton Sherwood Darboy/Appleton Employment More Use tab to navigate through the menu items. ﻿About Us Although Play & Grow started on July 1, 2008, the idea and plan began about 13 years earlier. While attending college in Stevens Point, Jason and Angie, recently engaged, had thought about starting a child care center. It seemed to be a perfect fit since Jason was finishing up a business degree and Angie was working toward a teaching degree. After college Jason followed a retail management career, while Angie gained experience in both a child care setting and as a fifth grade teacher. After several years, the idea of starting a child care center ended up on the back burner. Angie’s career brought her back into child care and she worked her way up to a Center Director. It was here that she was able to learn the ins and outs of the various regulations and the operations of a child care center. In the early part of 2008 Jason had an opportunity present itself for the purchase of a struggling child care center. Right away he knew that this was the opportunity that Angie and he had considered thirteen years earlier. With several changes to the operations, they saw the potential of this center and decided to pursue this opportunity. The process was challenging, but on July 1, 2008, Play & Grow Learning Center was born. The timing of this new center was not ideal as the economy began its worst recession in many years and Jason and Angie often wondered if they made the right decision. They had to do whatever it took to keep things going through the first year and a half such as doing the carpet and floor cleaning themselves and doing a lot of the food shopping and delivery in order to keep costs down. They stayed focused on improving the center by building good relationships with the parents and constantly improving the staff. After about a year and a half, their hard work started to pay off. Enrollment started to increase and the word started to get out about the quality of care that Play & Grow provides. In fact, the response was so good that Jason and Angie decided to open a second location in Grand Chute in the fall of 2011.  Again after lots of hard work, this center began to grow very quickly.  An expansion was done in 2014 to increase the space and add three more classrooms as well as a larger large motor room.  The center continues to focus on relationship building with their families and continues to grow. ​ After opening their second location, many families, staff, and friends would ask the question, “When are you opening your third?”  The response from Angie and Jason was always “we aren’t”.  Well, I guess you can never say “never” as Play & Grow Learning Center now has four locations serving the Fox Valley area making it the largest child care provider in the area.  In addition their children are now part of the business making it truly a family owned and operated business.  Play & Grow Learning Center continues to instill the same philosophy of building excellent parent relationships, providing a high quality educational environment, an ongoing focus on communication between parents, teachers, and our leadership team, and making Play & Grow Learning Center a place that your children will enjoy coming to every day.
