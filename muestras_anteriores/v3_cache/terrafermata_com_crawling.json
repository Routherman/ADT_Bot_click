Terra’s mission is to use the best ingredients Mother Nature has to offer, combined with cutting edge manufacturing technology and human innovation to create the best performing and most sustainable baby products. Even though our diapers are 85% plant-based, they don’t sacrifice functionality or performance! Check out this video: https://terragentle.me/pages/transparency. Honestly, the video speaks for itself! Terra Diapers absorb more liquid and dry faster than any other diapers on the market, and they happen to be made with better, more natural ingredients too! Are Terra Diapers biodegradable/compostable? At Terra, we want to be at the forefront of sustainable products that are convenient, gentle, and actually work, without taking a large toll on the environment. Unfortunately, at this time, just like all other disposable diapers, Terra Diapers are not biodegradable or compostable. There are two challenges to reach this goal. The first is that there are still components in all diapers that are made of plastics that won’t degrade in a timely manner. The second is that as soon as there is human feces in a diaper, it’s considered a biohazard and cannot be put in a home compost. There are very few composting facilities in the US that are properly licensed and equipped to handle the composting of products that have come in contact with human waste. Since this is not feasible for most people in the US, our diapers have not been officially tested to be considered compostable at this time. We are actively working on replacing the non-biodegradable components in our diapers with plant-based components and hopefully one day in the not-too-distant future we’ll reach that goal. At that point, in theory, a diaper with only urine in it could be compostable. However, any diaper with fecal matter in it would still have to be put in the regular trash, unless there is access to an industrial composting facility that accepts diapers. That being said, you can check out this video of an experiment our team conducted in New Zealand showing how the diapers decompose in landfills: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnkZ1K-30tY. Do Terra Diapers contain chlorine, phthalates, fragrances, latex, parabens or bleach? No, Terra Diapers do not contain any of those ingredients. Babies' skin is extremely sensitive, up to 5x thinner than adult skin and much more absorbent, so we ensure Terra products are free from harmful chemicals. You can read our Intertek Test Report here which confirms no harmful chemicals are used. Can I flush your wipes down the toilet? We don’t recommend flushing our wipes. They are compostable and biodegradable. What are the ingredients in your baby wipes? Our baby wipes are all-natural, and start with a 100% biodegradable, sustainably sourced bamboo fiber textile. Transparent ingredients: CLOTH: 100% Biodegradable FSC Certified Bamboo Fiber (NOT Bamboo Viscose); 0% Plastic LIQUID: 99.7% Pure New Zealand Purified Water, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein And that is simply all (which makes them perfect for adult faces too) How do I sign up for a subscription order? To sign up, simply select the subscription option on the product page, choose your preferred delivery frequency, and proceed to checkout. Your subscription will begin immediately. Can I apply a discount code to my subscription order? Discount codes and other website promotions for non-subscribers are typically not applicable to subscription orders at the time of initial purchase. This is because subscription orders already receive a standard 20% discount. Do I need to set up an account with you to place an order? No, of course not. You are entirely welcome to check out as a guest for a standard (non-subscription) order. If you think you’ll be back – and we hope to see you again soon – it makes it much more convenient for you to save your details by creating an account and we’ll keep track of your order history for you too. What should I do if I receive a wrong item? Please contact us at support@terragentle.co.au and we will arrange for the incorrect item/s to be collected at your earliest convenience. We will also arrange for your correct product/s to be delivered to you straight away. What is your exchange policy? If you’ve ordered the wrong size in error, we will happily exchange provided the following condition are met: 1. Please notify us within 1 day before your order is fulfilled 2. Kindly understand that we require the customer to cover the cost of return shipping. 3. Due to the nature of our products we are unable to accept exchange due to packs of diapers your baby has outgrown. 4. Items must be returned in the same condition as you received them. This means the item must be in the original undamaged packaging. 5. Our friendly customer service team are always on hand if you have any questions or concerns: support@terragentle.com.au How do I contact you? You can contact us via email at support@terragentle.com.au or through our chat box for an instant answer Do you have wetness indicator? Yes. All our diapers have a wetness indicator which turns yellow-blue as standard. Do you offer Trial Packs? We currently do not offering any FREE sample packs will launch soon! What are Terra Diapers made of? Terra Diapers are made with 85% plant-based materials, and our mission is to reach 100% plant-based in the future as new materials become available. The performance of our diapers is our guiding star, and we are not willing to sacrifice performance by using materials that don’t meet our requirements of superior absorption, instant dryness and preventing leaks. Unfortunately, it’s not currently possible to create a diaper that does all those things, without using some non-plant-based materials. Even if a diaper is made with more plant-based materials, if it doesn’t perform well, it has no value, so we are continuing our mission until we find plant-based materials that will work as well, or better than our current materials…stay tuned!\n\n\nIngredients:\nTopsheet: We use an incredibly soft proprietary polypropylene, as it performs better and wicks away moisture faster than any other material currently available. The combination of our moisture wicking Topsheet and our 360 super Absorbent Core results in a completely dry Topsheet against the baby’s skin in less than a minute. This means no sitting in a wet diaper, which causes diaper rash to develop. While we just launched in the US in 2023, Terra has been sold in New Zealand for 4 years and there has never been a single complaint about diaper rash from Terra Diapers. Our Topsheet material is similar in functionality to the material used in modern athletic wear like the popular “momiform” leggings. Cotton is a wonderful material as long as it’s dry, but there is a reason athleisure wear is no longer made of cotton… it takes forever to dry!\n\nPlant-Based Absorbent Core: The fluffy core that helps absorb liquid is made from wood pulp sourced from the US. The wood pulp is made from FSC Certified sustainably grown and harvested forests. High-quality Japanese SAP (super absorbent polymers) is added to the pulp and wrapped in tissue paper.\n\nSuper Absorbent Polymers (SAP): The most important ingredient in any diaper is the Super Absorbent Polymers (SAP), as that is what absorbs the majority of the liquid. SAP comes in many different quality grades, which means there is a dramatic difference in cost resulting in most diaper manufacturers using less, lower quality SAP. Terra only uses the most premium quality Japanese SAP that can quickly absorb up to 20 times its weight, which helps our diapers absorb liquid faster and perform better than any other diapers we have found! Therefore, it’s fair to say that the SAP truly is the “secret sauce” for diaper performance, and it confirms the old saying that “you get what you pay for”!\n\nPlant-Based Waterproof Breathable Barrier: This layer is made from 100% plant-based PLA, which is a thin film derived from non-GMO corn starch. This layer has micro-pores that are small enough to stop liquid molecules from passing through to prevent leaks, but big enough to let air through, which helps reduce the heat and moisture inside the diaper to keep babies dry. You may feel slight heat and moisture on the outside of the diaper soon after your baby urinates. This is not urine leaking, the heat you feel is from the urine being absorbed into the diaper. The moisture on the outside of the diaper is water vapor coming through the micro-pores, which helps reduce the moisture on the inside of the diaper. It's similar to a humid day, where it feels kind of wet outside, but it's not actually wet, just moist air.\n\nPlant-Based Backsheet: The Breathable Backsheet, or the soft outer cover, is made from 100% Bamboo Fiber, NOT Bamboo from Viscose. Many diapers use Bamboo Viscose, which goes through a harsh chemical process during manufacturing. Our 100% Bamboo Fiber is manufactured through a mechanical process where no chemical treatment is necessary. See FAQ below in the Wipes section about the difference between Bamboo and Bamboo Viscose.\n\nPlant-Based Leg Cuffs: Our double leg cuffs are not only stretchy for a comfortable snug fit around baby’s legs, they are also super soft. The stretchiness comes from plant-based natural rubber and the moisture barrier is made from bamboo fiber and polypropylene.\n\nPlant-Based Wetness Indicator: Our wetness indicator is made from natural wax that changes color when exposed to moisture.\n\nFrontal Tape Fastening System: (Only found on Diapers, not Training Pants) For a secure and comfortable fit that allows the baby to move around, we use a hook and tab fastening system that is made of polypropylene. The tabs are securely attached to the diaper to avoid any pulled tabs and destroyed diapers, and they can be fastened and unfastened as needed.\n\nFood Grade Ink: All ink used on both the diapers and the packaging are tested to be food grade.\n\nPlant-Based and Recyclable Packaging: The packaging for our diapers is made from 100% recyclable craft paper made from FSC Certified mix wood chips and post-consumer recycled corrugated paper. The moisture barrier on the inside of the craft paper is made from rice and is sealed using rice glue which allows the packaging to be fully recyclable.\n\nPlant-Based Case Pack – Our cardboard case packs are fully recyclable and made from FSC Certified cardboard and post-consumer recycled paper. How long do your diapers take to biodegrade? TERRA diapers are 85% plant-based and biodegrade in three-six months based on our degradation testing. 85% of our diaper had completely biodegrade in that time, with the remaining 10% being our tabs, cuffs, and part of the frontal tape that for the time being require PE (polyethylene) for strength and flexibility. But we’re working on it! What certifications do your diapers have? Our diapers are dermatologically tested and rated as \"excellent,\" ensuring they are gentle and safe for your baby’s delicate skin. We are proud to hold FSC certification, which means our products are sourced from responsibly managed forests. Additionally, our diapers are eco-friendly, made with sustainability in mind to minimize environmental impact while providing top-notch performance. What is a subscription order? Never worry about running out of diaper & wipes again! By signing up to a subscription, you’ll get our best prices and will save 20%. In addition, you have full control over your account and can skip orders, make adjustments, or cancel at any time. How do I pause or cancel my subscription?

The same is now true of every Ukrainian. BUILDING BRIDGES TO UKRAINE SONGFEST FOR VETS III - UKRAINE RELIEF will raise money through donations that will be sent to Ukrainians in urgent need of our help and support. The daylong affair will include Ukrainian food, art, and music, as well as classic rock. The event takes place from 12 to 10 p.m. on May 22 at Terra Fermata in beautiful Stuart, Florida. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post #9610 and the American Legion are the proud sponsors of SONGFEST FOR VETS III - UKRAINE RELIEF, which will also honor American Veterans on this Armed Forces Day! The four key fundraising goals are to: • Support the Kyiv Angels, a group of volunteers who go from building to building in Kyiv and the surrounding towns searching for mobility-challenged elderly who were left behind by refugees running for their lives. There is a long list of needed items, and this group of volunteers purchases and distributes these vital supplies, themselves. Donors will see the results of their contributions quickly and potentially even during the show. • Support Ukrainian farmers. It’s planting season in Ukraine and farmers are desperately trying to plant the crops the World is dependent on, including wheat and potatoes. Your donations will go to buy spare parts and make repairs on farm equipment and irrigation systems. • Buy body-armor plates. Civilians can't buy military equipment, but desperately need body armor. Your donations will fund the purchase of armor plates that will be sewn into protective vests. • Support a farm in the suburbs of Kyiv that is sheltering more than 250 pets that have been separated from their families. Every day more animals arrive. Your donations will go directly provide for the care and feeding of these orphaned pets. Hundreds more animals like these need to be transported to the farm, fed, and cared for every day. Performers at the event include acclaimed tribute bands: KISS Alive; Erasmith, which channels Aerosmith; and Shoot to Thrill, which conjures up AC/DC. Classic rockers Shovelhed also will be on hand. There may be some surprise performances as well. Make a difference! Donate to support veterans, support Ukraine, and support freedom. Spend an entertaining afternoon honoring and helping those who fought for our freedom in the past and those fighting for our freedom now. Help ensure that the wounded, disabled, the elderly and even all those orphaned animals have the support they need. Your donations will definitely help!

      "text": "Who We Are - Terra Alpha Skip to content Menu Guiding Principles Who We Are Investing Resources Contact | Investment Portal Who We Are Terra Alpha Investments is an employee and investor owned investment management firm based in Washington, D.C. Terra Alpha Investments operates an actively managed global public equities strategy using a hybrid quantitative/qualitative investment process. Our investment team, led by Timothy P. Dunn, CFA, brings over 75 years of professional investment and portfolio management experience, and a deep understanding of how evolving financial and environmental trends/patterns interact in an increasingly interconnected global economy. We leverage the knowledge of our Advisory Board members, leading academics, economists, scientists, and NGOs to increase our understanding of environmental, economic and social patterns and their impact on financial markets. Why we started Terra Alpha Investing with purpose: Better returns, better environment, and a better world Terra Alpha’s founder and CIO, Tim Dunn, CFA, built his successful investment career on the premise that identifying and investing in truly great businesses brings long-term sustainable returns. He was also raised on the principle to try and make everything you are involved with a bit better – family, community, team, or business. Read More Over two decades into his career, as a lead portfolio manager at Capital Group/American Funds, Tim had become frustrated by the growing shortsightedness of financial markets. Of particular concern was the failure of market participants to consider critical themes like climate change and natural resource constraints; which were creating negative impacts on our society. In order to make a more positive impact, he left Capital and the investment business in 2009 to work with environmental NGOs like the Nature Conservancy, Piedmont Environmental Council and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), to advance effective collaboration between environmental nonprofits and the business and investment communities. At CDP, Tim worked with the senior team to help institutionalize the growing universe of corporate-disclosed emissions, water, and forest information and data. At TNC he pushed for more action on climate change and built a better understanding of leading environmental practices at corporations. During that time, he began to develop the thesis that incorporating corporate environmental performance into company analysis would improve both investment and environmental returns. In late 2014, Terra Alpha Investments was born to put this thesis into practice. Tim recruited experienced investors Andrew Geller and Dan Sanborn to help him reimagine the traditional investment process. Together, they have built the team and implemented our unique hybrid quantitative/qualitative process structured around our proprietary Environmental Productivity framework. Terra Alpha envisions a world in which our economy operates in harmony with our natural systems. We believe that companies can lead positive change and that those who adapt the fastest will derive significant benefits. We strive to provide our investors with better financial returns and societal outcomes through a rigorous analysis of Environmental Productivity and thoughtful consideration of what constitutes an enduring business model in today’s rapidly changing world. The opportunity to serve the financial needs of investors alongside delivering a better environment and a more sustainable world makes everyday engaging and rewarding.

Highway Commercial Government Industrial OUR CUSTOMER STORIES “ Terra Constructs was awarded the Sound Walls subcontract for our recently completed I-95 Southern Terminus Extension project in Stafford County. Their level of commitment to timely delivery helped us to complete the project eight (8) months ahead of schedule. We were fortunate to have selected a partner that also understands the importance of producing quality work that meets or exceeds our customers’ expectations and is proactive in seeking and offering solutions to challenging issues. For these reasons, we have since awarded Terra Constructs several additional projects, and we look forward to continuing our relationship for years to come . Brian Evans , Vice President of Operations at Branch Civil, Inc. “ Terra Constructs was able to overcome significant challenges through innovative design, strong construction management, and a ‘never quit’ attitude . This was a substantial project with tight deadlines and various site challenges, however, Terra worked collaboratively with us and condensed their schedule in order to meet the project deadline. In short, they delivered, and I couldn’t be more pleased . Chuck Smith , Vice President at Shirley Contracting Company, LLC “ We hired Terra Constructs to finish site-work on our project after terminating our original contractor. They responded quickly, exemplified excellent workmanship and commitment to detail, and were able to complete the project within budget and on schedule . Their performance on the project gave me the confidence to pursue other similar projects in the future. Mazhar Chaugtai , CEO, CDG Development “ We have used Terra Constructs, as a subcontractor on several key Dominion Energy projects. They are a trusted partner who performs exemplary work for ITAC and have become an integral part of our team.
