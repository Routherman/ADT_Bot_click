By Emily Bloch UPDATED: June 5, 2018 at 7:39 AM EDT The smell of fresh paint was still thick throughout the Frank C. Ortis Art Gallery and Exhibit Hall. A two story wing that’s been in the works since 2013, the gallery is part of the new Pembroke Pines City Center, which celebrated its ribbon-cutting ceremony last week. As ceremony attendees toured the complex, they exited the main lobby, swung a right and passed the new commission chambers as well as the gallery. But they couldn’t take a full tour yet. Ladders were staggered throughout the main room and blue painters tape lined the doorways. On April 27, Chief Curator Jill Slaughter said there will be much more to see. “Most people have an idea of what’s wonderful to them,” Slaughter said. That’s where the gallery’s first exhibit, What’s Wonderful, got its theme. “We hope to foster a connection that gets people to talk.” The exhibit will feature 15 different artists. What’s Wonderful will open on Thursday, marking the grand opening of the gallery, which is nicknamed The Frank. Light refreshments will be offered and DJ AXR the Alchemist will provide the soundtrack. The gallery, which is nicknamed The Frank, will showcase local artists throughout the year. Slaughter says exhibits will rotate every six weeks and will include guest series as well as student and nonprofit series. Two days after its opening, on April 29, The Frank will host its ACT Festival — short for Activate, Celebrate, Transform. The art festival will take place in the surrounding plaza outside The Frank and will include live music, dancing, an interactive chalk art piece and more. “The ACT Festival is an opportunity for artists to reach out,” Slaughter said. “All in an effort to create a more inclusive creative community.” What’s Wonderful, The Frank C. Ortis Art Gallery’s grand opening, takes place on April 27 from 6-9 p.m. The ACT Festival takes place on April 29 from 12-3 p.m. The Frank is located at the Pembroke Pines City Center, 601 City Center Way, Pembroke Pines. To RSVP to either event, email thefrank@ppines.com .

MIAMI, FL (January 28, 2022) – A solo exhibition by Melanie Oliva featuring works from her After-image Series of watercolor and acrylic paintings will run from February 10 to April 23, 2022 at The Frank Gallery in Pembroke Pines, FL. Oliva, a Miami artist who changed careers from Creative Director in advertising to fine artist in 2014, has been using her artwork to bring awareness to sociopolitical and environmental issues since. While her After-image paintings use a visual illusion to tell stories about threatened flora and fauna, the colors aim to assure the viewer that climate change is anything but an illusion: “My After-image Series was born from driving through Miami as a passenger after we moved here – I would close my eyes at particularly scary moments. I noticed the sun would leave a detailed ‘after-image’ under my eyelids of what I saw beforehand. This inspired me to create a series using this visual phenomenon as a metaphor”, says Oliva. The series forewarns that the beauty of our world may someday only survive as an after-image – the image you see after staring at something bright – if we close our eyes at the most critical moments and do not act to protect it. Oliva’s solo show – located in The Frank Aisles gallery (lobby) – runs concurrently with group exhibition Elemental: Terra, Tide & Time (main gallery) and Natural Mystic (second floor). Guests are invited to attend the opening on February 10 from 6-9pm at The Frank Gallery, 601 City Center Way, Pembroke Pines, FL. Parking and admission are free and masks are required.

MIAMI, FL (Mar. 23, 2018) – Photographer and activist JohnBob Carlos has curated a group exhibit called “Awaken Florida”, which opens Thursday, April 12 at the FIU Green Library and runs through April 30. The show, hosted by Vicki Silvera, head of Special Collections at FIU, includes Carlos’ large-format photography and work from several local artists, all of which showcases Florida’s unique features and rich biodiversity. “May this exhibit serve as a reminder of the natural beauty that is here now and that can still be saved for future generations”, the photographer says. Carlos is a native Floridian who captures images of Florida’s wildlife, landscapes, waterways and cultures. In recent years, he’s become deeply concerned about the state of Florida’s natural resources and is alarmed at the devastation of the areas he loves – largely due to development. Carlos uses photography as a voice for the Florida’s flora and fauna and to help preserve the culture of the region. His imagery has been used to champion petitions combatting fracking, to preserve the Pine Rocklands, to highlight clean water initiatives, to oppose roads that could destroy the Everglades and to support various conservation efforts. Carlos has also selected work from artists who advocate for Florida’s fragile ecosystems. Participating artists include Dita Devi, Nancy R. Koerner of Junglepixiebelize , Jeniece Martinez, Melanie Oliva and Eva Ruiz . Mediums range from paintings and woodblock prints to exotic wood carvings. All are invited to the opening reception for Awaken Florida on Thursday, April 12, from 6pm-9pm, at the Steven and Dorothea Green Library, FIU campus, 2nd Floor, 11200 SW 8th St., Miami, FL 33199. The event is free to the public. More details can be found here . Help wanted? Miami artist will work for food. MIAMI, FL (Mar. 23, 2016) – Eco-artist Melanie Oliva will work for food, but not in the sense you might think. Oliva seeks to collaborate with activists, scientists and other artists with a goal in mind. She’s creating awareness for environmental issues with her artwork, in an effort to ensure Earth’s inhabitants will have enough food in the years to come. She believes that awareness, collaboration and action are the keys to protecting our fragile ecosystems and reversing the effects of climate change; otherwise, we could see drastic reductions in our food supply. Oliva uses her “After-image” series to bring these issues to light, with each painting providing a problem and solution. From Oliva, “Each painting represents what you see when you close your eyes, after staring at something bright – suggesting the subject may only survive as an after-image unless action is taken. With this series, I have the ability to give endangered plants and animals a voice, who so desperately need our empathy and respect. I worry about the world my niece and nephew will inherit. I’ve found that using my artwork to convey a message can inspire people to act.” Oliva’s advertising background has also been helpful in creating change. Last August, she collaborated with her brother Scott Dickerson and husband Mike Oliva to start Inspiration Pollination – a grassroots coalition of creators who use their work to connect the public with the plight of pollinators. “The group creates free advertising for pollinators and their role in food production, by encouraging members to incorporate them into their next project.”, says Oliva. After eight months, the online group has grown to more than 600 makers, gaining members from around the globe after an article was published by The Huffington Post . Oliva has witnessed people who may have never considered themselves environmentalists become advocates for bees, bats, butterflies and hummingbirds. You can join the group on Facebook, read their blog , and follow their progress on Twitter (@inspr8npollin8n) and Instagram (@inspirationpollination). Oliva recently collaborated with photographer/activist JohnBob Carlos on “Florida After-image #1” to depict an area of the Everglades that will be negatively affected by the River of Grass Greenway bike path . She’s also advocated for the Florida Black Bears with her artwork and by writing a collaborative article for RedFlag.org. In addition, she’s volunteered with the grassroots group Imagine Our Florida to help get anti-bear hunt resolutions passed across the state. Oliva just recently completed a painting of Miami Seaquarium’s Lolita, inspired by the efforts of activists Sylvia Grimaldi Gomez and Danielle Daals , in hopes that Lolita will soon be retired to a sea-pen or protected cove.

Futscher protects the future of the Everglades with group show at HARRISART MIAMI, FL (Dec. 3, 2015) ­– Miami artist and environmental activist Joan Futscher is spreading awareness about the proposed River of Grass Greenway (ROGG) and its potential impact on the Everglades, one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet and home for a host of pollinators and other endangered wildlife. She’s coordinated a group show with artist and gallery owner Jane Harris called FOR EVERGLADES – one more effort in her history of peaceful activism on behalf of the national park. HARRISART is holding a closing reception for the show this Saturday. Futscher’s passion for shielding the Everglades and five other parks from the ROGG began with the “Walk for Mother Earth” back in March, led by Bobby C. Billie, the spiritual elder of the Micossukee Tribe, and Betty Oceola. The four-day, 75-mile walk covered ground proposed for the ROGG bike path. Although Futscher broke her wrist the night before the walk and could not complete it, she was inspired by accounts from the 19 other participants, including photographer JohnBob Carlos . The group’s reconnection with nature during the walk drove them to form an alliance with a common goal – to further protect this “protected” wildlife habitat that gives species like the endangered Florida Panther a place to thrive. They saw firsthand that the path would cut through wetlands considered critical to carbon and water absorption, acting as a natural barrier to flooding. Frustrated that Amendment One is not preventing development in the Everglades as promised, the group has sought action and spread the word. They’ve attended public meetings, written emails and hand delivered letters to Mark A. Heinicke, CPRP, CLARB, Senior Park Planner, Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces Dept., Planning and Design Excellence Division, to no avail. The group’s efforts continue as the ROGG remains scheduled. Curated by Jane Harris, the show includes work from an Everglades Facebook challenge initiated by JohnBob Carlos in July, and has a few “family-friendly” surprises. Artwork from Joan Futscher, JohnBob Carlos, Carmen Ferreiro, Liliana Leiro, Melanie Oliva, and Anne Gordon Vega is featured and dialogue with the artist activists is encouraged. The plan for the ROGG is on display and a petition to stop the ROGG will be available to sign. Futscher aims to inspire those who may be new to environmental activism and also sees this event as a thank you to those who have been working to protect the Everglades, in hopes the support will encourage them to keep going. The closing reception for the show FOR EVERGLADES is Saturday, December 5, 2015, from 2-5pm at HARRISART, 4432 SW 74th Ave., Miami, FL 33155 in the Bird Road Art District (BRAD). Artists give pollinators wings MIAMI, FL (August 22, 2015) – Miami environmental artist Melanie Oliva launched Inspiration Pollination, an online community of artists and creators who have the power to influence others through their work. This effort was in response to the White House’s announcement in May that pollinators’ numbers are rapidly decreasing, putting them at serious risk for extinction. “I was surprised at how little many I talked to knew about the matter and how apathetic some were. I thought, ‘If they don’t know just how critical pollinators are, how much does the general public understand?’ Familiar with the work of Josh Keyes, John Sabraw and Mary Iverson, I know that art can elevate important issues. I decided to theme a series of artwork, but I felt I could do more.” After brainstorming ideas with her husband – some potentially dangerous like installing and manning billboard-like beehives – a simpler idea came to mind. She could encourage other creators to incorporate the message into their next project, gaining what is essentially free advertising for pollinators’ plight. Using the Ice Bucket Challenge as her model, Oliva challenged the original 200 members of Inspiration Pollination (including Nashville’s Herb Williams and Miami’s Oliver Sanchez) to post a pollinator-focused project on Facebook and pass the challenge on to four more to keep it “pollinating” throughout the online world. As the group gains a larger following, the artist hopes to turn it into a non-profit that will foster community efforts and help other artists with similar environmental aspirations.
