Members of the Board of Education Ryan Patton Board President Ryan was elected to the West Clermont board in 2021. He is a Deputy Sheriff with Clermont County and previously served as a School Resource Officer at West Clermont. This allowed him to proactively engage with students and staff. His goals as a board member include adopting policies that focus on the priorities of the district; developing initiatives that improve student achievement; and ensuring fiscal responsibility. Jim Rudy Board Vice-President Jim has been a West Clermont board member since January 2018. As a former teacher and union leader in the district, he has an intimate knowledge of the school culture. Giving back to the community, particularly the students, is what motivates him. Since serving on the board, he is most proud of hiring excellent leaders who are fulfilling West Clermont’s mission to commit to excellence with every learner, every day, every way. Michael Chumley Board Member Michael is in his fifth year as a West Clermont board member. He works for a local healthcare system where he has learned the importance of timely and accurate communication, a skill that transfers well to his role with the district. The students, including his own, are what motivate him to serve. He is committed to helping children overcome the academic and social-emotional trials of the last two years. His favorite part about being on the board is witnessing how the entire West Clermont team cares for one another and the students, which is evidenced by the many recognitions and awards staff receive each year. Tina Sanborn Board Member Tina was originally elected to the West Clermont School Board in 2011 and served until 2019. One of her goals as a board member is to promote academic excellence for all students. Tina wants to align taxpayer dollars with an educational system that gives our children the opportunities to excel in an ever more competitive economic environment. She served on the board during the opening of a new facility for West Clermont High School, West Clermont Middle School, Summerside Elementary and Willowville Elementary. Her passion is serving the West Clermont School District Board of Education and working to improve and provide the best educational opportunities for every student. Tammy Spencer Board Member Tammy was elected to the West Clermont board in 2023.  She has been a member of the West Clermont community for nearly 40 years, and has served as an educator for the past 15 years.  As a mom, grandmother, resident and educator, she is poised to bring a unique and meaningful perspective to the board.
