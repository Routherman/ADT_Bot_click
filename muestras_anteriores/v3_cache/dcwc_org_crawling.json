At only 29, Chloé already has an ever growing team of five members and has gone from strength to strength to build her brand. Starting her company six years ago at 22 whilst still in university, Chloé has collated an impressive collection of high profile art clients such as the National Trust, World Monuments Fund and Moniker Art Fair. In Theatre, Chloé has an incredible reputation at the Edinburgh Fringe and she also caters for a huge variety of clients across the Off West End and West End scene. Chloé was also recently nominated for Rising Star Award in Variety Catherine Awards which was a fantastic accomplishment. What inspired you to start a business? Throughout school and university, I’d always enjoyed taking the helm – that ranged from managing a fashion show to organising events.  I hadn’t originally anticipated that I’d run a business but during my time studying at The Courtauld Institute of Art I became involved with, and then chaired, a student-run contemporary art exhibition, the East Wing Collection. Through this, my PR skills developed rapidly as I began to get a taste for the industry.  I’d always been sure I wanted to work in art but I realised that PR was where I wanted to be. My experience of working at other PR firms confirmed to me that I wanted to spearhead projects in my own way and feel truly invested in what I was doing.  When, in March 2010, a gallery asked me to handle their PR, Chloé Nelkin Consulting was born. For me this was the logical way forward. I was lucky enough to feel confident in my own skills, find something that ticked all my boxes and I felt sure enough to put my own name on the door. What is the greatest challenge and the greatest reward in being your own boss? I think the greatest reward is having been able to watch my own business grow and develop. I’m proud of the decisions I’ve made over the years that have taken CNC to where it is today – the company has gone from just me working at the kitchen table to a successful agency with offices in central Soho. The business has expanded, we’re now a team of six who are about to celebrate our 7 th birthday. There have been many challenges along the way but I think they’re important to growing a successful business. Because it’s my company, I’m emotionally involved in my work.  I believe in openness and honesty – a key ethos of CNC – and it’s challenging for me to accept that not everybody is the same. I find rude or untrustworthy behaviour very draining, whether it’s directed at me or my staff. What motivational tips can you give to our members about goal setting and managing both successes and failures. Everybody encounters failures to some degree at some point in their careers and it’s often through failures that we can learn the best way to do things. As corny as it sounds, it’s so important to learn from these and not let them have a long-term effect on the way you work. It’s also important to set yourself achievable goals. Yes, the sky is the limit, but some things take a long time to work out so it’s vital to have goals that can be managed short term. Make sure there’s always a reason to celebrate! What is the biggest challenge you have faced as a business owner? I think my biggest challenge has been dealing with the fact that I’m a workaholic. PR is a 24-hour a day industry and because of this I find it very hard to switch off. I love what I do so it’s very easy to get swept away and work all the time – my staff sometimes joke about who received the latest email from me as they are checking what time I’ve worked until. But, I’m finally learning to juggle things a bit better and master my work/life balance. I’m a perfectionist though and really take responsibility for everything we do – it’s this caring nature that is one of the keys to our success. As time goes on I’m learning that delegating is important too; I have the most incredible team who are excellent at what they do and I don’t actually need to work 24 hours a day. I don’t know if any business owner can ever really switch off but I’m certainly getting better at finding time to relax as time goes on. How have you benefited from mentoring or coaching? I’ve never had formal mentoring or coaching but I do really value having a strong support network to help guide me – I have many people I look to for advice including friends, family and leading figures within the industry. These are the people who have given me confidence, encouragement and cause to celebrate over the years. When I am drowning with work they remind me to stop for a moment and look at what I’ve achieved. Having this strong support network is crucial to me and it’s important to have a sounding board I do think for many people though that mentoring is very important and I find it humbling that people now look to me for advice – I’m always happy to guide in any way I can so that people learn from my experiences. What advice can you give about the benefits of networking? I’ve always been a great believer in the importance of networking and good manners and those are two of the things that make me successful in what I do today. East Wing (the exhibition that I told you about earlier) was an amazing networking tool for me and I was able to make connections with some of the top gallerists and artists working in London at that time. It was through East Wing that I met CNC’s first client. The best piece of advice I can give is that networking is only worthwhile if you follow up – if you meet someone then don’t let them forget you.  Be confident and believe in what you do and have to offer and then networking will come naturally. What are your tips for scaling a business and how do you plan for and manage growth? CNC is a business that  grows organically. I’m very happy with where the company is, I have an amazing team and we work on some incredible projects across the year. CNC grows as and when it needs to rather than me putting pressure on the business to meet a set expansion point. What does the future hold for you? I don’t have a crystal ball but the business is exactly where I want it to be for now. 2017 is set to be a brilliant year and CNC has been expanding in a really exciting way so let’s see what happens next.

(Kneeling) student Steven Alonso. The Woman’s Club of Homestead has begun a fundraising project. According to Ruth Perry, Clubhouse Manager and Woman’s Club member, they will be selling engraved bricks on the pathway to the gazebo in the garden of their Woman’s Club located at 17905 SW 292 Street, Homestead, Florida. Margie Buster, a faithful member of the Woman’s Club of Homestead, requested the assistance of Homestead Job Corps Center (HJCC) to lay the brick pathway and to lay the engraved bricks as they are bought.  Margie Buster, President of Redland Tropical Gardens, stated “we’ve worked with the Homestead Job Corps Center in the past and it’s always been a good experience.  I thought it would be a great opportunity and experience for the students to leave a wonderful legacy for the Woman’s Club.”  For several days, HJCC masonry students and their instructor, Terry Devine, volunteered tirelessly to install the brick pathway. On Wednesday, May 20, 2015, the finishing touches were done by the Homestead Job Corps Center Masonry students.  “This is on-the-job-training for our students…the best experience they can receive.  This particularly was a spectacular experience for the students due to the hospitality of the women from the Woman’s Club” stated Devine. Established in 1914, the Woman’s Club of Homestead celebrated its 100 year anniversary in 2014.  They recently installed their new President Alice “Texas” Steep.  Club members Doylene Losner and Evelyn Guilfoyle were also involved in the planning and implementation of this collaborative project.  Ruth Perry commented about the students “It was such a delight.  They were a wonderful group of young men (and one young woman) who worked hard and followed the directions given by their great instructor.  They were just terrific.”  Homestead Job Corps Center masonry student Steven Alonso said of the experience “It was an education.  I learned how it is to be in the workforce.  It gave me something to look forward to in the future.  It was also a blessing because of the people here (at the Woman’s Club) who treated us so kindly.” This is the second such project the Homestead Job Corps Center has undertaken. In 2006, Mr. Terry Devine and students laid the bricks at the Veteran’s Memorial at Losner Park in Homestead. To this date, Mr. Devine and current HJCC students return to the park to lay newly bought memorial bricks under the direction of longtime Homestead resident and military veteran, Bob Jensen.

This allowed them to extend their influence and usefulness to the rest of Pasco County and other areas in Florida. The current clubhouse was built in 1926 by George Gillespie.  It is a one story combination of Prairie Style & Mediterrean Revival architectural design. It embodies distinctive features characteristic of Florida women's clubs such as a meeting hall, stage, separate dining areas, and kitchen.

The Miami Woman’s Club members return to restored bayfront home After waiting over a decade of reconstruction and intricate refurbishing of their 1926 historic clubhouse, the Miami Woman’s Club finally is back in the iconic five-story building in Downtown Miami at 1737 N. Bayshore Dr. The Miami Woman’s Club, now in its 122nd year of service, conducted its first meeting in the renovated clubhouse on Aug. 24 to install the board members for 2022-23. A larger grand opening will be celebrated later this year. “All of our members and friends are excited to renew our mission of assisting community groups and to continue to play a vital role the civic, cultural and educational life of Miami,” said club president Shirley Pardon. The striking Mediterranean Revival building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has been refurbished to most of its original style including the parapet roof adorned with stone balustrade and 1926 Italian lighting embellishing the oak flooring on the Club’s third floor. The main changes in 2022 are that the building is joined by two world-class restaurants (Klaw is now open on the fourth floor and another restaurant will open next year on the first floor). The leasing of these spaces provides income to the Miami Woman’s Club to assist in the future maintenance of the building and the service operations. For nearly a century members of the club passed through the arched entries and ornamented columns designed by famed architect August Geiger. In 1926, the building was one of the nation’s largest and most expensive women’s clubs, with more than 1,000 members. During this time, The Miami Woman’s Club was open every day with events, classes, an auditorium for concerts and speeches, and the location of Miami’s only public library. Like other clubs around the nation, The Miami Woman’s Club lost members when women begin working in the 1960s. During the lengthy construction period, the club has maintained its mission within the community plus keeping offices and regular meetings next door at the Doubletree/Grand Hotel. The club’s most important goal was to keep donating to the local community, especially during the pandemic. “In the last two years we have served the community through several initiatives and have focused on contributing financially to many small non-profits struggling during COVID-19, helping them to continue to serve the community,” Pardon said. “We also gave a hand to front-line staff from hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and fire rescue services.” Now settled in its renovated home, the club will continue its service efforts and once again be hosting local civic and cultural groups in their iconic home on the third floor. Club leaders hope that this move back into the building will bring a rise in membership. “Tens of millions of dollars have been invested to bring this gem back to life,” Pardon said. “Between the activities of the Miami Woman’s Club, the appeal of international restaurants and our amazing location, our proud ‘Grand Lady’ will once again be a destination on the bay.” To see more #Miaminews from #Aventura to #Coralgables to #SouthMiami, #Pinecrest, #Palmetto Bay and #Cutler Bay and all throughout #Miamidadecounty go to: www.communitynewspapers.com Connect To Your Customers & Grow Your Business Click Here Community News Releases TAGS Bayfront Club home Member Miami restored Return Woman Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Previous article Coral Gables Community Foundation awards over $100,000 in grants Next article Pinecrest and its police: At impasse…again Community News Releases This story was brought to you by a member of the community.
