When configuring a mail address in your client application, you must decide between setting it up as POP3 or IMAP. You can connect to the mail server to read your emails using an email client. IMAP and POP3 are the most widely used standard protocols for email retrieval. These protocols are supported by nearly all mail clients and servers today. Email clients use POP3, an application layer protocol, to obtain a message from mail servers via a TCP/IP network. POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol Version 3. IT professionals designed POP to move messages from a server to a local disk, but version 3 now gives users the choice to keep a copy on the server. 💡 Note: Although POP3 is a very simple protocol, it limits its application. POP3, for example, only permits the usage of one mail server per mailbox. It is no longer in use now because of modern protocols like IMAP. The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), a widely used Internet protocol, allows email clients to get emails from mail servers. RFC 3501 is the standard that details IMAP. IMAP is intended to aggregate messages from several mail servers into the user's inbox. A common illustration is a business client who manages many corporate accounts using a local mailbox on her workstation. Message Accessing Agents, such as POP3 and IMAP, are frequently used to retrieve messages from a mail server and deliver them to receiver systems. Both protocols aid in configuring filters for spam and viruses. IMAP is recommended if you want to access your email from many devices. This capability includes work computers and a smartphone. POP3 works better if you only have one device and a lot of emails. It is also preferred if you need to see your emails offline due to a poor internet connection.
