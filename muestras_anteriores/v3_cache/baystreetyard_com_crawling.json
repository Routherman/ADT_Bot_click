Identified projects should be prioritized based on future flood risk, water quality, and benefits to disadvantaged communities. As much as possible, the city should identify green stormwater infrastructure solutions to drainage issues; this could take the form of a green streets master plan. Examples Pacifica Pacifica’s Storm Drain Master Plan identifies capacity deficiencies in the storm drainage system, develops feasible alternatives to correct these deficiencies, and plans the infrastructure that will serve future development. It includes an analysis of future precipitation impacts on the storm drain system. San Mateo County The San Mateo Countywide Green Streets Master Plan identifies “how and where to build sustainable streets in San Mateo County that integrate stormwater management with local priorities, like bike and pedestrian mobility, transit improvements, climate change adaptation, and more.” It includes an analysis of stormwater runoff under future climate scenarios, which determined that the planned green street projects could offset the projected roadway runoff due to climate change for a 2-year storm. Additionally, the green streets projects were prioritized based on water quality, flood risk, water supply, climate change impacts, groundwater constraints, utility constraints, vulnerable community indicators, vehicle ownership statistics, urban canopy, and urban heat island effect. × Integrating Flood Resilience Into Capital Improvement Planning Local jurisdictions must ensure that public infrastructure (such as parks, streets, sewers, stormwater infrastructure, and shoreline infrastructure) are designed for flood resilience and incorporate nature-based solutions wherever possible. They can do this by creating capital improvement planning processes to ensure all proposed projects are evaluated for flood resilience and green infrastructure potential. Examples Burlingame Burlingame has a green infrastructure checklist used to evaluate opportunities to include green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) features in capital projects. This approach ensures that no opportunities for GSI are missed. It can be found in Appendix B of the city’s Green Infrastructure Plan . San Francisco San Francisco has a “Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco Sea Level Rise Checklist” . Using this checklist ensures that all capital projects planned in the sea level rise vulnerability zone are resilient to sea level rise. × Sea Level Rise and Groundwater Rise Overlay Districts Sea level rise and groundwater rise overlay districts map out which geographical areas will be affected by flooding under future climate conditions and apply specific development requirements or restrictions on those areas. Overlay districts can be created through a zoning code update and are a key step in ensuring that flood-resilient development conditions are implemented and enforced. OneShoreline’s Planning Policy Guidance provides template language for creating Sea Level Rise and Groundwater Rise Overlay Districts. Examples Burlingame In 2021, Burlingame updated its zoning ordinance to include regulations for the Bayfront Commercial District, including guidelines for new development to be resilient to sea level rise. Section 25.12.050 outlines public access, flood, and sea level rise performance guidelines for new developments. It adopts Burlingame’s Map of Future Conditions, including a Sea Level Rise Overlay District, which is based on the Our Coast Our Future hazard map . South San Francisco In 2022, South San Francisco (SSF) updated its zoning code to include a Flood Plain/Sea Level Rise overlay district. The overlay district includes areas that will flood under a 36-inch sea level rise scenario and a 100-year storm. It imposes new construction requirements including base flood elevations sufficient to protect against the FEMA 100-year event with 3 feet of sea level rise, nature-based stormwater infrastructure designed to function under future conditions, and a bay access buffer within 100 ft from the shoreline. × Shoreline Resilience Plan With the passage of SB 272 (Laird, 2014), Bay Area cities are required to create Shoreline Resilience Adaptation Plans (RSAPs) and have those plans approved by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) by 2034. BCDC has released draft RSAP guidelines which cities must follow when creating their shoreline plans. The guidelines will be finalized at the end of 2024. We hope to see the final guidelines reinforce an emphasis on nature-based solutions, public access, and community engagement. Examples Hayward The Hayward Regional Shoreline Adaptation Master Plan (HRSAP) was created in 2021 to establish a vision and adaptation strategies for protecting natural and built shoreline assets from sea level rise. It recommends shoreline resilience projects such as horizontal levees, gently sloping vegetated buffers that provide sea level rise protection and water quality benefits. The HRSAP was created by a joint powers authority consisting of the City, the Hayward Area Park and Recreation District (HARD), and the East Bay Regional Park District. × Favorite native plant or animal: Sky Lupine Favorite thing to do around the Bay Area: Reading a book outdoors and spending time among redwoods Superpower: Telekinesis Erin Pang Policy Manager epang@savesfbay.org Having grown up in the Bay Area, Erin is excited to join Save The Bay and work towards equitable climate policies for the region.

Richmond, CA, San Francisco Business Times The Issue The AstraZeneca site on the Richmond shoreline was once the site of sulfuric acid, pesticide, and fertilizer manufacturing. Because of this industrial pollution, it is now contaminated with high levels of toxins such as benzene, lead, arsenic, uranium, and pesticides like DDT. So far, cleanup efforts have included leaving contaminated soil on site and “capping” it by placing concrete on top. The City of Richmond has plans to build up to 4,000 housing units on top of this contaminated land. However, as sea levels rise, groundwater will also be pushed up to the surface, potentially pushing the toxins into pipes and through cracked concrete, putting the health of residents and surrounding communities at risk. The Solution For decades, frontline community members in Richmond have been raising awareness about the health and environmental threats posed by groundwater and sea level rise displacing toxic contaminants on industrial sites. Because of a long history of racist policies, the communities surrounding these sites are largely low-income communities of color. They are advocating for full cleanup of the AstraZeneca site before any housing is built on it, rather than simply capping contamination in place. This would involve removing all contamination from the site and taking it to a safer storage or treatment site. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which oversees cleanup of the site, should require AstraZeneca to conduct a full cleanup. Additionally, groundwater and sea level rise should be considered in all toxic site cleanup efforts.

The highway’s redesign, if done correctly, offers an opportunity to build climate-resilient infrastructure and restore 20,000 acres of wetlands. Highway 37 on a dry day, Karl Nielsen The Issue Highway 37 sits on a levee in San Pablo Bay in the north Bay Area.  In 2017, the highway was shut down for a month due to flooding caused by a combination of King Tides and winter storms. During the atmospheric rivers in January 2023, the highway was again closed for a weekend when it flooded due to Novato Creek overflowing. These closures will likely happen again and again as sea levels rise if no action is taken. This would disrupt 40,000 daily car trips which people depend on to get them to jobs in Marin, Sonoma, Napa and Solano Counties. Additionally, the levee that the highway sits on currently blocks natural tide flow from San Pablo Bay to wetlands on the north side of the highway. The Solution The redesign of Highway 37 is currently in the early planning stages. One of the proposed designs is to build the highway on an elevated causeway. This would put the highway above the reach of rising sea levels while also letting water ebb and flow with natural tidal action between San Pablo Bay and the wetlands beyond the highway. Once these 20,000 acres of wetlands are reconnected with the natural flow of tides, they can be restored to their full function, providing habitat, carbon sequestration, and flood resilience benefits.

State Coastal Conservancy) × San Mateo County Of all the counties in California, San Mateo County is the most vulnerable to sea level rise. San Mateo, January 2, 2023, Bruce Washburn The Issues Sea Level Rise Sea levels could rise by up to 3.3 feet in San Mateo County by 2070 and 6 feet by 2100 according to the county’s Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment . While the whole Bay Area will experience rising seas, San Mateo County is particularly vulnerable, with over 30,000 homes, dozens of schools and hospitals, and over 7,000 acres of wetlands at risk of flooding by 2070. Historically underinvested communities will be the most at risk when flooding occurs because historic inequities placed affordable housing in higher flood risk areas and because they are more vulnerable to economic damages incurred. Inland Flooding Not all flooding happens at the coast. As storms and groundwater rise become more extreme, Bay Area communities will continue to be impacted by flooded streets and homes due to outdated stormwater infrastructure. Additionally, urban areas are primarily covered in concrete, asphalt, and other surfaces that don’t allow water to seep through. This means that during storms, rainwater runs off these surfaces picking up pollutants (like motor oil, chemicals, and trash) on its way to creeks and the Bay. The Solutions Sea Level Rise Preparing the county for sea level rise will require a coordinated effort among cities to plan and implement solutions such as wetland restoration, horizontal levees, and sea walls. San Mateo County has taken steps in this direction with the creation of OneShoreline , a government agency that works across jurisdictional boundaries to plan and implement sea level rise resilience measures in the county. The County also conducted a countywide Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment to identify areas that will be impacted by flooding and erosion and provide solutions. This coordinated effort should be replicated across the Bay Area. Cooperation between cities and counties throughout the Bay Area is necessary to ensure that shoreline protection in one area doesn’t result in greater flooding in others. This could happen, for example, when a sea wall in one city deflects storm surges towards an adjacent city without flood protections. There should also be coordination at the state and federal level to provide funding to low-income cities that may not otherwise have resources for sea level rise planning. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) is currently creating guidelines to shape local sea level rise plans. Inland Flooding Cities must invest in updated stormwater infrastructure to reduce flooding and capture and clean stormwater before it reaches our waterways. In particular, green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) uses natural systems like vegetation, soil, and permeable surfaces to capture stormwater and filter out pollutants. Examples include rain gardens, bioswales, and tree wells. When cities upgrade streets, parks, and other infrastructure, they could be incorporating GSI at the same time, making these new investments more flood resilient.  San Mateo County is supporting this kind of integrated planning with their Sustainable Streets Master Plan .

I hope I'm right.\" Fry and his business partner ― former Fort Myers mayor Randy Henderson ― think they have something unique in Southwest Florida: A laid-back, outdoor venue that will be home to food trucks, yard games, live music, sports-watching parties on a huge LED screen and two bars built inside metal shipping containers. Fry calls the new venue \"casual, but upscale.\" It’s inherently casual, he says, because it's outdoors. But just about everything else about Bay Street Yard is upscale and high-class. General Manager Mimi Wallace echoes that point. \"There is nothing else around that is anything like this,\" she says. Bay Street Yard: Something 'new and exciting' in downtown Fort Myers On this recent Wednesday, Wallace and Bay Street Yard's owners sit on comfy couches in the venue's second-floor VIP area, The Loft, as they excitedly talk about their new venture. The covered, open-air Loft features three cozy \"rooms\" and a line of chairs along the balcony rail overlooking the main floor and concert stage below. All around them, Bay Street Yard employees in khaki shorts and orange shirts busily scurry around as they prepare for a private party. Wallace previously worked at JW Marriott Marco Island Beach Resort , but she says she eagerly took this new job as general manager of Bay Street Yard. \"Once I saw they were creating this amazing concept, I knew I had to be a part of it,\" Wallace says. \"It's creating something that is new and exciting.\" Since COVID, outdoor venues have been much more in demand, Fry says. And he knew that whatever he built in Fort Myers would lean into that outdoor concept. \"It all came from the idea that people generally like being outside,\" Fry says. \"When you go to a restaurants and the weather's nice, there's a waiting list to be outside. And that started me thinking.\" That's why everything at Bay Street Yard is open-air: Not so great in the summer, they admit, but something that will be huge draw once the weather cools. \"During the winter, this place is going to be very popular,\" Fry predicts on this sweltering Wednesday afternoon. \"A day like today? Some will come, some won't. Because it's hot.\" Collaborating with Luminary Hotel and a former Fort Myers mayor The outdoor entertainment venue was built on an empty lot owned by Henderson, just across from Luminary Hotel on Bay Street. Henderson says he's owned the land for 27 years. Fry was originally looking elsewhere to build the place, but then he started talking to the former Fort Myers mayor. They've been working together on the project for more than two years, Henderson says. Together, they've packed a lot into that 12,000-square-foot lot: Roughly eight steel shipping containers ― 20 feet long and painted orange and black ― converted into two bars, a manager's office, bathrooms and more; a concert stage; the upstairs VIP area; a food-truck lot with three food trucks; and a \"play yard\" with Adirondack chairs, artificial grass, a cornhole game, table tennis and more. \"Every inch of it is being used,\" Wallace says. \"Every single inch.\" Bay Street Yard's approximately 30 employees have been training for about a month to offer knowledgeable, attentive service, Wallace says. They're all employed by Mainsail Lodging & Development , the same company that owns the next-door Luminary Hotel. Mainsail was contracted to manage the place, Fry says. 'Permanent' food trucks and two bars One thing that sets apart Bay Street Yard is the three food trucks parked in the venue's paved food truck area. They're a permanent part of the place ― at least for the length of their one-year contract. Southwest Florida catering company Paradise Hospitality Group created the new food trucks just for Bay Street Yard, Wallace says. \"They custom-built these trucks for us.\" The lineup features Banzai Asian Cuisine (Asian food), Bay Street Butcher (American food) and Rick's Taco Cartel (Mexican food). They offer everything from fried sushi rolls and Korean fried-chicken sandwiches to cheesesteak melts and smashburgers to shredded-beef tacos and churros in chocolate sauce. \"It's better than any restaurant in downtown Fort Myers,\" Wallace says. \"It's amazing.\" Paradise Hospitality's chefs include one trained by The Culinary Institute of America, Fry says. \"These are not your normal food trucks. That's the point.\" To see the food truck's menus, visit baystreetyard.com/menu . Live bands, sports planned at Bay Street Yard The centerpiece of Bay Steet Yard is its 20-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep stage at the west end of the play yard. The covered stage is flanked by two big, colorful murals from local artist Shari Shifrin of the Fort Myers Mural Society . There's also a huge 8-foot tall, 13-foot wide LED TV screen for watching sports and other events. Wallace envisions themed TV-watching parties for the Super Bowl, the Final Four, golf tournaments and other major sports events – all with a crystal-clear picture and a high-end sound system. As for live music, Bay Street Yard will bring in Florida and touring bands every Friday and Saturday night until 9:30 p.m., when deejays will keep the music going until 2 a.m., Wallace says. \"We'll be bringing in the most spectacular live music performances from all over Florida,\" she says. That includes jazz, country, rock, classical and other genres ― starting Saturday with Nashville rock and country singer-songwriter Karin James and her band. \"We have two criterias for entertainment,\" Fry says. \"One is we're trying to make it unique. We want to make it unique in some fashion ― especially unique to downtown Fort Myers. \"And then we want them to be sophisticated. We're not gonna have guys who come in here and use profane language on the stage. That's not gonna be allowed.\" Most of the bands are touring acts from Florida, but some will come from as far away as Nashville and New York. Wallace also expects to host events related to concerts happening at the nearby Caloosa Sound Amphitheater, such as meet-and-greets with major touring acts or private acoustic sets before or after their Caloosa Sound shows. For a lineup of upcoming bands, visit baystreetyard.com/specials-events . More about Bay Street Yard Bay Street Yard can be found next to the parking garage at 2136 Bay St. in downtown Fort Myers. It's across the street from Luminary Hotel. The new venue can accommodate 300-450 people. There isn't a rental fee for the VIP spaces in The Loft, but there is a \"beverage minimum\" purchase that depends on the day or the week and time of year. Prices start at $240 for eight people on weekdays (which breaks down to $30 per person), Wallace says.

The two-story hub poured its first drinks Memorial Day weekend and had a ribbon cutting ceremony shortly after. It offers live entertainment, tasty bites and artisan styled cocktails in an open-air setting. “We are really excited to be here and officially open! This is very unique, and the city has never seen anything like this before. It was created with a great team and brought in over 1,500 people on our soft opening,” said David Fry, Co-owner of Bay Street Yard. “This is a great addition to Fort Myers. Successful businesses bring two things: providing the community with services and employment to people,” said Kevin Anderson, Mayor of Fort Myers. Bay Street Yard is located at 2136 Bay Street and is open Thursday through Monday. Its layout is unique because it is built with repurposed shipping containers, which create a sleek and modern style. The 12,000-square-foot venue features seating for over 300 people and holds over 450. It is fully equipped with two covered bars and three food trucks. COURTESY PHOTOS The trucks offer street-style fares from Bonzai Asian Cuisine, Rick’s Taco Cartel and Bay Street Butcher. Rafael Feliciano and Paradise Hospitality Group created the cuisine. The three food trucks were developed for Bay Street Yard. The menus include nachos, tacos, smash burgers, glizzies (also known as hotdogs), fried sushi baskets, dumplings and other delights. “We are so fortunate to be a part of this and serve the food items we created. We focus on food trucks and catering, kitchens on wheels. These trucks are numbers seven, eight and nine for us in Fort Myers. Our culinary team brings a lot of flavors and expertise within different types of food and styles,” said Feliciano. Bay Street Yard has 12 specialty beverages, including top-shelf liquors, beers, wines, zero-proof creations and Happy Hour deals. “Mocktails usually mean fruit punch, but we use non-alcoholic spirits to make tasteful drinks,” said Fry. “They created a drink for me, called the ‘Mimi Style 75.’ It even has my favorite thing – gold glitter,” said Mimi Wallace, General Manager. “We have a cocktail selection like no other, and I could eat the Sunrise Smash Burger for breakfast, lunch and dinner.” “I am so thrilled to be a part of Bay Street Yard. We emphasize having fabulous service and had a record high in sales during our first night of opening. We had a line around the block to come in. This is a place for everyone. Bring the family and dog during the day and welcome everyone 21 and up to hang out at night,” said Wallace. Bay Street’s “The Loft” offers a wheelchair accessible VIP section with an elevator, providing convenient access for all guests. This versatile space can be rented entirely or divided into three private areas, accommodating small and large groups. The venue and upper-level space plan to serve the community with customizable events, including specialty catered menus and wine pairings for fundraisers, corporate functions, weddings, and more. Bay Street Yard was designed with the community in mind. The new social scene has a covered stage for live entertainment with sonic brilliance-produced sound systems, 8-foot by 13-foot LED televisions, and outdoor games of cornhole, ping pong and bocce. “Imagine the Super Bowl here. I plan on playing movies during the holidays. I imagine kids on the lawn watching ‘Polar Express’ and the adults sitting back and hanging out near the bar area,” said Fry. “I had an idea for a food truck and beer garden in downtown,” said Randy Henderson, Co-Owner and former mayor of Fort Myers. “Two years later, here we are! Thank you to the city of Fort Myers.” ¦ In the KNOW Bay Street Yard · When: : 2136 Bay Street, Fort Myers • When: Monday and Thursday 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., Friday – Sunday 11 to 2 a.m., closed Tuesday and Wednesday • Information: baystreetyard.com/ • VIP Rentals: baystreetyard.com/private-events/ More From Arts & Entertainment News Go To The Arts & Entertainment News Section Future Foodies Painting the Foundation FastTrax, Fettuccine and Fun: One Diva’s Guide to September Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

She lives with her husband Joel, 3 kids, and 4 cats. In her spare time she enjoys crocheting. 231.439.2502 [email protected] Jessica Cusson Associations Coordinator Jessica started her career with Bay Harbor in 2015 as the Sales Assistant to the Harbor Sotheby’s International Real Estate team. Her Paralegal degree from Colorado Technical University provided the attention to detail and understanding of the legal forms in the real estate field.

After a summer internship at a golf resort in West Virginia overlooking Cheat Lake, Craig realized that hospitality was his passion. Craig has been fortunate enough to work with some incredible resorts. Craig began his management career at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort in Pennsylvania, leading a team that earned the coveted AAA 5-Diamond rating and a Forbes Travel Guide 5-Star award. Career goals took him and his family to the beautiful British Virgin Islands, where he ran a resort on Virgin Gorda for over 2½ years. Biras Creek Resort was a 31-villa ocean-front property. Biras Creek Resort was renowned worldwide for its incredible service and high-quality food and beverage program. The resort genre fits Craig’s management style, and he enjoyed his time at the resort. Upon returning to the U.S., Craig was hired to run two ski resort hotels; one at Seven Springs Mountain Resort and the other at the Hidden Valley Resort, both near Champion, Pennsylvania. A year and a half later, he concluded that small unique properties are where his heart lies. While overseeing 700 rooms and two ski resorts was an exciting opportunity, Craig missed being able to provide a certain sense of refinement and luxury to resort guests. He was also given the opportunity to take the helm at The Inn at Leola Village, a boutique property in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Inn at Leola Village has a 4-Star Forbes Travel Guide rating for lodging and a restaurant with a 5- star rating. While the property was beautiful, Craig and his family knew the location was not ideal for them. When given the opportunity to work for Victor International for the second time, and live and work along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, it was an opportunity too exciting to pass up. “Luxury,” “Unique,” and “Independent” are three descriptors of a property that Craig most likes leading; and Village Suites Bay Harbor is an ideal match. 231.439.2421 [email protected] Melanie Loviska sales & events manager I recently joined the team at Village Suites Bay Harbor as the Sales & Events Manager, bringing with me a strong background in hospitality and a passion for delivering exceptional guest experiences. I approach every opportunity with a professional mindset and a genuine drive to bring joy and positivity to each interaction—whether with guests, clients, or colleagues. I’m excited to contribute to the continued success of Village Suites and help create memorable moments for everyone. Outside of work, I love to golf (especially at Crooked Tree Golf Club). If I am not on the golf course, you could find me reading a book, baking, gardening, petting the nearest dog, or listening to music. 231. 758.9924 [email protected] Linda Parker Assistant to the chairman Linda Parker began her career at Bay Harbor in 1995 as an administrative assistant in the real estate office and over the years has assisted the Chairman of Bay Harbor Company.

After graduation, an opportunity to be the Harbormaster at a marina near Muskegon allowed Martin to build his knowledge to operate the facility in its entirety.
