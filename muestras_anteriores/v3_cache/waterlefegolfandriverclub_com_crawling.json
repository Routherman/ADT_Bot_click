Golf Golf at Waterlefe Golf and River Club “If one looks at the world’s finest courses, all have one thing in common – memorable holes. Waterlefe will share at least that much with the world’s finest, for it will have not only memorable, but unforgettable holes. The course starts, touches at times and ends on a particularly beautiful section of the Manatee River, replete with wide expanses of pristine marshes and pleasant coves, and the player should not be surprised if, on the 15th tee, he or she spots a family of manatees poking their noses up for a breath of air. Waterlefe has not been an easy course to develop, and a great amount of time, effort and expense went into protecting, and where necessary restoring, the very environment that gives the course it’s unique character. The course will present both challenge and beauty to players of differing abilities. From the ‘tips’ Waterlefe will be a real tiger (try the par 3, 230 yard 9th hole – all marsh from tee to green). Members will find play from the other tees to be more forgiving, although certainly not a pushover. From any of the 5 sets of tees provided, Waterlefe® will present a memorable – even unforgettable – golfing experience.” – Ted McAnlis Dining Dining at Waterlefe Golf and River Club Sunset Grille at Waterlefe Golf Club After your round of golf, our clubhouse offers the perfect place to unwind with your favorite beverage and relive the best moments of the day. Whether you’re in the mood for a hearty breakfast, a casual lunch, happy hour drinks, or one of our daily chef specials, the Sunset Grille has something for everyone. Come relax and enjoy the view! River Club at Waterlefe Welcome to the best-kept secret on the Manatee River. Our River Club offers everything from club-made pizza to filet mignon, all served impeccably by a professional staff that knows you by name and how to make your evening just right. It is no wonder that our homeowners and members love to gather here. Marina Marina at Waterlefe Golf and River Club The Waterlefe Marina Club is an equity membership club that offers our member boating enthusiasts a high quality marina facility. The Club, the only residential marina directly on the Manatee River, maintains 59 slips ranging in size from 20 to 29 feet. The Club is a not-for-profit corporation, managed by an elected Board of three members. The Club has an annual budget funded by members’ dues which cover fresh water, electricity, insurance, common area lighting, maintenance/cleaning of the docks, and 24-hour Video Surveillance/Security. Members are assigned slips and have the flexibility to rent their assigned slips when they are “between” boats. Due to our convenient location, club members can board their boats and immediately enjoy water sports of all kinds, and with just a short trip downriver to the Gulf of Mexico experience world-class river and flats fishing, offshore fishing and cruising to the numerous restaurants and recreational facilities.
