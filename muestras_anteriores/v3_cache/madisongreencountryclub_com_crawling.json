This is not true, around the world there are so many different ways to set up and design a wedding reception. American wedding venues tend to recognize about 7 common options. One of the biggest choices you’ll face is deciding on the type of wedding reception that best fits your vision and needs. Whether you’re engaged and just starting to plan, or you’re knee-deep in wedding planning, understanding your options can help make this part of the process smoother and more enjoyable. Ultimate Guide To Wedding Reception Options Near Palm Beach – if we missed an option, let us know in the comments! 1. Formal Sit-Down Dinner What It Is: A traditional choice for many couples, the formal sit-down dinner features a multi-course meal served to guests while they remain seated. This type of wedding reception is ideal for those who want a classic and elegant atmosphere. Benefits: Structured Dining Experience : Guests are comfortably seated and served, allowing for a more controlled and organized event. Elegance and Class : A sit-down dinner adds a touch of sophistication to your wedding reception. Personal Interaction : You can spend quality time interacting with guests at their tables. Considerations: Cost : Generally, a formal dinner can be more expensive due to the service staff required and multiple courses. Time-Intensive : This type of reception tends to take longer, which might impact how much time you have for other activities like dancing or speeches. Photo provided by the talented Jordan Summer Photography 2. Buffet Style What It Is: A buffet-style reception offers a variety of food options set up at different stations where guests serve themselves. This option is perfect for those who crave variety and want to keep things casual yet festive. Benefits: Variety : A buffet allows you to offer multiple dishes, catering to different tastes and dietary restrictions. Flexibility : Guests can eat at their own pace and choose what they like, creating a relaxed atmosphere. Cost-Effective : Buffets can be more budget-friendly as they typically require fewer serving staff. Considerations: Flow and Lines : There might be a wait at the food stations, so consider having multiple stations to minimize delays. Space Requirements : Buffets require more space for setup and movement. Photo provided by the talented Jordan Summer Photography 3. Cocktail Reception What It Is: A cocktail reception focuses on finger foods, small bites, and drinks, creating a more social and lively atmosphere. This type of reception is ideal for couples who want a modern and chic wedding. Benefits: Social Atmosphere : Encourages mingling and interaction among guests. Variety of Foods : Offers a range of appetizers and hors d’oeuvres. Flexibility : Often more flexible in terms of timing and flow of events. Considerations: Limited Seating : Usually provides less seating, which might not be suitable for all guests. Food Quantity : Ensure there’s enough food to keep guests satisfied over several hours. Ultimate Guide To Wedding Reception Options Near Palm Beach 4. Brunch or Luncheon Reception What It Is: Daytime receptions, such as brunch or luncheon, are becoming increasingly popular. These types of receptions are usually held earlier in the day and feature lighter fare like pastries, salads, and mimosas. Benefits: Cost-Effective : Typically less expensive than evening receptions. Unique and Memorable : Guests might find a daytime event refreshing and unique. More Daylight : Perfect for outdoor settings with natural light. Considerations: Early Start : Guests and the wedding party need to be ready earlier in the day. Limited Evening Activities : The event may wrap up earlier, which might affect travel plans for out-of-town guests. Photo provided by the talented Jordan Summer Photography 5. Destination Wedding Reception What It Is: A destination wedding reception takes place in a location away from home, often in picturesque or exotic settings. This type of reception is perfect for couples looking to combine their wedding and honeymoon into an unforgettable experience. Benefits: Stunning Locations : Offers beautiful and unique backdrops for your wedding photos. Intimate Gathering : Typically involves a smaller guest list, making it more intimate. Built-In Vacation : Guests can enjoy a mini-vacation while attending your wedding. Considerations: Travel Costs : Can be expensive for both the couple and their guests. Logistics : Requires more planning and coordination, especially with travel and accommodations. This is one of our locations where we could host an Al Fresco wedding reception, we would remove the heart shaped backdrop and set up beautiful tables, chairs, linens, lighting, decor and stations here! 6. Al Fresco Wedding Reception An al fresco wedding takes place outdoors, often by our waterfront area or any natural setting. This type of wedding allows for a unique and picturesque backdrop that can’t be replicated indoors. The term “al fresco” is Italian for “in the cool [air],” signifying the refreshing and open nature of these events. Benefits of an Al Fresco Wedding Natural Beauty : One of the most significant advantages of an outdoor wedding is the natural beauty it offers. Nature provides a stunning backdrop, reducing the need for extensive decorations. Flexibility : Outdoor weddings offer more flexibility in terms of space and layout. You can have different zones for dining, dancing, and relaxing. Unique Atmosphere : An al fresco wedding provides a relaxed and informal atmosphere that many couples desire. The open air and natural surroundings create a magical and intimate experience for guests.

Madison Green Country Club is a top-value favorite among local golfers and savvy visitors in West Palm Beach, FL. Open to the public and located just 20 minutes west of both downtown and Palm Beach International Airport, this championship course has earned rave reviews since its opening in 2001. Golfers are drawn to its fun and varied design, natural setting and wildlife, and consistently pristine playing conditions. Our South Florida Golf Facility Has It All Our practice facilities include a driving range, chipping green with practice bunkers, and putting areas. The clubhouse features a well-stocked golf shop, men’s and women’s locker rooms, and the Marbar Grille offering food and beverages inside and out on the patio. Madison Green Country Club has earned its championship credentials, having hosted U.S. Amateur qualifiers and other important state tournaments. A tee time at Madison Green CC promises to be a fun day of golf with the biggest bang for your buck in West Palm Beach. Par-72 Golf Course This stunning par-72 course winds through a lush, natural landscape, offering fresh challenges and surprises at every turn. Water plays a prominent role on all but one hole, with 42 acres of lakes seamlessly integrated throughout the layout. While back tee players will face some demanding carries, there are often safer, more strategic routes that minimize risk on approach shots. Adding to the test, over 100 well-placed bunkers and waste areas demand precision and smart shot-making.  The greens are expertly manicured, with pronounced slopes and contours, and they offer a quick pace that rewards precise, confident putting. 5 Tee Settings To ensure an enjoyable and rewarding experience for golfers of all skill levels, the course offers five distinct tee options. Renowned for its immaculate conditions, Madison Green features smooth, true-rolling greens and lush, well-manicured fairways. The spectacular design coupled with the extraordinary conditions set this golfing experience apart from anything in Palm Beach County. Natural Surroundings As you make your way through the course, you’ll be immersed in a landscape of Pine Barrens, palm trees, majestic oaks, palmettos, and thousands of native plants. While holmes border some fairways, the dense natural foliage creates a peaceful buffer, offering a sense of seclusion throughout your round. You’ll likely be joined by Florida’s native wildlife, including Great Blue Herons, Sandhill Cranes, Snowy Egrets, hawks, and other birds of prey that call the course home. No Parallel Fairways Renowned course architect John Sanford designed a breathtaking layout that seamlessly weaves through protected nature preserves. The expansive routing offers a dynamic experience, with each hole heading in a unique direction—no two fairways run parallel, ensuring variety and a sense of discovery throughout the round. Experience golf the way it was meant to be played—challenging, scenic, and truly unforgettable. Pro Shop Our fully stocked Pro Shop offers everything a golfer could need—whether you’re a seasoned player or new to the game. Discover top-tier clubs, high-performance golf balls, and stylish, functional apparel.

Project Location and Added Amenities Property is located on the west side of Crestwood Boulevard at the entrance to the Madison Green Country Club. Gallery Important Dates Neighborhood Meetings TBD Frequently Asked Questions Why do we want to build a golf lodge? To ensure the viability of a beautifully maintained golf course so that residents will continue to have picturesque views and open space. Will views of the golf course be affected? No, the site has been carefully selected to ensure that no residents’ views of the golf course will be blocked or affected. Will the golf lodge create congestion or traffic? No, a traffic study performed by Simmons and White, a well-respected local firm, concluded that the proposed Golf Lodge traffic would be considered an insignificant impact to the surrounding roadway network. Madison Green Traffic Letter How will the lodge benefit the community? The Golf Lodge will provide upscale lodging by Marriott one of the most well-known and respected lodging providers in the world. Marriott’s Springhill Suites brand was selected because it is family oriented. All residents of the Community will receive a friends and family discounted rate when staying at the lodge, creating a convenient place for your guests to stay. Marriott will also accept accumulated reward points for stays. We believe that infusing over 20 million dollars for the Lodge and improvements of the golf course, will increase the values of surrounding homes. If a need should arise to move out of your home (repair/renovations), the lodge will be close and available. In addition, there will be generators located at the Golf Lodge to provide electricity for the lodge in case of a major storm or hurricane. This is a long term commitment by us to keep a beautifully maintained championship golf course and facility. The Golf Lodge will allow for added security around the property. The addition of the Golf Lodge will include a full service restaurant for the community to dine at. The lodge facilities will bring an increased tax base and jobs to the community. How many rooms will the lodge have? 108. Who is building the lodge? The current ownership of Madison Green Country Club, which has owned the course and Club for approximately 15 years, is partnering with Marriott to build a Spring Hill Suites Golf Lodge. Who will construct and manage the hotel? Naples Hotel Group with 25 + years in hotel management and development will oversee the construction and management of the Golf lodge Will guests of the lodge have access to any of the amenities of the Madison Green HOA? No.  The Lodge will have its own pool, fitness center, locker room, and other amenities.  Lodge guests will not have access to Madison Green HOA facilities. When is the anticipated start date and completion date for construction? Construction is estimated to start in 2025 and to be completed in 2026/2027. Will local residents have to contribute any funds for the golf lodge? No. Will Madison Green still remain a public course? Yes. How long is Madison Green Country Club required to remain a golf course? There is currently a restrictive covenant requiring the course to remain a public golf course for 30 years. There are only a few years left on this restriction. We are willing to extend this deed restriction upon the approval of the Golf Lodge. Will any amenities be taken away from the golf course? No. It will remain a 7,000 yard + par 72 championship golf course. The course will add a new practice facility and will improve the overall conditions of the golf course. Will the Golf Lodge create a lot of noise? No.  The Lodge will have concrete block construction with hurricane impact glass.  There will be no balconies. Will the Golf Lodge appearance and character be in keeping with our Community? Yes. We are working with the Village to match existing architecture as much as possible and try to keep the lodge within the limited height requirements with no variances. The most the height would differ is 3 feet. Learn more about Marriott Springhill Suites https://springhillsuites.marriott.com/ Have you been communicating with the residents and stakeholders? Yes, we have been proactive with our public outreach.  Some particular public outreach efforts include: Publishing this project webpage Setting up a project hotline for residents and stakeholders to call with any questions or concerns Mailed informational postcards to all residents Mailed a meeting notice and held a public meeting on June 18 What does a typical Springhill Suites by Marriott look like?
