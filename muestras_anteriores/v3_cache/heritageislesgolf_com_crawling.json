The definition of PIVOT is a rod or pin on which something else turns. In a golfers case or torso (pin) rotates on top of our two legs. Hopefully this pivoting or rotation is centered and balanced without too much wobble much the same as a spinning top. Percy Boomer, the teacher voted as the most influential golf teacher in history, compared the pivot to an architectural compass drawing of arcs with the only difference being that the golfer’s body is supported by two legs that have joints and flexions. The rotary movement of the torso and twisting of the golf shoes spikes into the ground generate a shear force that travels upward from the ground into the golfers center of gravity and then turns outward through the arms and hands to the club head. Once the force reaches the club head through rotary movement the golfer’s body, arms, and hands need to oppose (opposition) of the outward centrifugal pull simply by not letting the club head fly out of their hands. If the rotary movement remains centered with little sway, the circular pull of the club head arc will remain relatively constant and align itself into the back of the golf ball automatically. The WIDTH of swing arc will also be maintained if the golfers allow the momentum of the golf club to accelerate through the ball. That’s why the golf swing should always be thought of as a MOMENTOUS OCCASION! For example, a track star throwing a Hammer has their arms pulled straight throughout the rotary loading of ENERGY until utmost power is built when they finally RELEASE the Hammer at the perfect time resulting in the greatest distance. The key fundamentals of this rotary golf movement and loading and releasing of energy is not to interrupt the constant flow of power by trying to add power to the club head by hitting at the golf ball with just the arms and shoulders. Ernest Jones the great teacher from the mid 1900’s wrote two illustrious books, one in 1937 called SWINGING INTO GOLF, and the other in 1952 called SWING THE CLUBHEAD with both books content reflecting a MOMENTOUS OCCASION and memorable experience by sensing the momentum of the club head swinging and the body reacting to its momentum automatically. I always like to refer to Percy Boomers remarks regarding the importance of the pivot in relation to the excessive use of forced hitting with the arms. “Yes it is golf bogey number one, that overwhelmingly common impulse to hit the ball where we go it to go with the power from our arms and shoulders. So as a result we take vicious scoops and lashes at the ball, What a Pity, What a Pity! For if we had inhibited that desire to hit forcefully with the arms and concentrated on power from the pivot and arms reacting to that force we would have sent the much further and straighter and have known the secret to successful golf”. Rick Bradshaw 2004/2006 North Florida Section PGA Teacher of the Year Director of Instruction, Dent/Bradshaw School of Golf Heritage Isles Golf Club Filed Under: Instruction Do You Swing The Golf Club Like Norman? October 2, 2016 by wpcomvip Several years ago a friend of mine wanted to learn how to play golf. We went to the golf range and he started hitting. He hit some erratic shots, chopped the ball into the ground a couple times, bladed a bunch and almost hit me once when he shanked one sideways. He looked at me and said; well what do you think? I remarked; your golf swing looks just like Norman. He beamed with a smile and said; Greg Norman? I shook my and head and said no, Norman Bates! You know from the shower stabbing scene in the movie Psycho. Your kidding he remarked. Yes I am however your swing is a little choppy. We went on to discuss and learn how to smooth out a choppy swing and develop a smooth accelerating one. The following steps will help. 1 Get rid of the thought of hitting at the ball and develop a swinging motion as if the ball was not there. Swing at the daisies was Percy Boomer’s suggestion. The ball only weighs 6.2 ounces, 5.9 in the Pro V, so let the steel of the club impact the ball naturally without added force. 2 Maintaining a constant swing arc by bracing your arms together at address forming a triangle down to your grip will help diminish any independent chopping at the ball. Be sure to draw in your biceps toward your thorax and maintain a feeling of straightness in the elbows to establish a fulcrum or leverage effect that will insure a constant and controlled swing arc. 3 The next essential step is to power your swing through a rotary pivot of the torso, hips, and shoulders. If you were good at the Hula Hoop it may help. Percy Boomer coined a phrase turn in a barrel. I personally like the drill drill which is the image of twisting your body like a drill back and forth digging your spikes into the ground. This powering the swing from the ground up will generate the centripetal force that will travel up through the legs, body, shoulders, arms and hands whipping the club head through the ball as a centrifugal swing. 4 This fundamental power key of turning back and twisting through with the torso, hips, and shoulders allow the arms to swing up on plane automatically virtually free of strain in the shoulders. There should be no independent lifting or abrupt steering, guiding, or hitting at the ball that will interfere with the constant whipping action of the club through the ball. Bobby Jones coined the phrase Free Wheeling through Impact which is exactly the sensation you are looking for. 5 If you don’t want to swing the club like Norman Bates, power the club through a rotary pivot and let the club swing upon the back swing and down on the through swing sensing the momentum of the club head swinging throughout. A quote that was made from teaching great, Percy Boomer , states it best in my mind: “If at the moment of impact you stop the forward pull of the left side, which is what you will do if you hit at the ball, the power is not available and club head cannot, as it should, continue accelerating in contact with the ball until the ball rebounds from it.” Rick Bradshaw 2004/2006 North Florida Section, PGA Teacher of the Year Director of instruction Dent/Bradshaw School of Golf Heritage Isles Golf Club Filed Under: Instruction Do You Swing Like A Drunken Sailor? October 2, 2016 by wpcomvip In the 33 years I have been a golf teaching professional I would venture to say that the majority of golfers that walked onto my lesson tee initially swung the club wildly with their arms trying to swat that ball down the fairway. I always tell them that you are swinging like a drunken sailor and that their arms are AWOL (absent without leave). Swinging the golf club into the back of a golf ball is tough enough without trying to swat the club violently at the ball with the arms free of leverage and control of the upper torso. There has to be some point of control to keep your arms from going A W O L. This point is the connecting of the upper triceps upon your pectoral chest muscles. This connection limits the ability of the arms to run of and leave your body behind. This concept is why so many tour professionals place a towel under both arms to practice. The towel drill and connection of the arms on the chest not only limits the premature lifting of the arms on the takeaway but leaves your body no choice but to initiate the swing with a pivoting motion. Once the pivot sets the club in motion and energy is passed to the club head as it swings back around a little and up into a set position at the top of your back swing. The pulling force may pull your arms off a little as the club swings up but don’t lift the arms actively on the back swing! If you do lift your arms it is more difficult to control the swing arc and stay on a constant path. Your goal is not to try to get the attention of a plane or ship like Tom Hanks waving his arms in the movie Castaway. I personally have my students hold a volley ball in front of them and tell them to use their body to toss the ball forward while all the time keeping their arms on the side of the body. They do have to yell WISLON loudly when they toss it. Percy Boomer the most influential golf instructor of all time stated this about the arms in the golf swing. “Now I have told you not to use your arms to hit with, in fact you should not play golf with your hands and arms at all but with your feet and legs. Now this is an exaggeration but one that is necessary to correct the natural tendency to use our hands and arms to the detriment of foot and leg work. THE ARMS WANT TO WORK AND WILL WORK, so it is necessary to emphasize the importance of foot and leg action in order to get the proper balance”. The control or counter balance is the connection of the arms to the chest to power the swing through rotation into the resistance of the feet both on the back swing and through swing. The arms will swing naturally reacting to this pivoting motion. WAIT A MINUTE CALL THE M.P’S I SEE ANOTHER DRUNKEN SAILOR TEEING OFF HOLE #1.

From the Gold back tees, our par-72 course plays at 6,976 yards, and the par 3’s are possibly the most challenging in Tampa, says Rick Bradshaw General Manager and two times PGA Section Teacher of the Year. Designed for golfers of all skill levels , our five sets of tees; Blue-6,236 yards, and White-5,615 yards, make Heritage Isles a very fair, challenging, and fun golf experience. From the forward Red tees the course measures 4,832 yards, very manageable for golfers with a shorter, straighter drive. Regardless of your length off the tee or ability level, your short game will play an important role in scoring while playing Heritage Isles. Manage your approach shots well and our large, well-maintained greens will reward those players who putt well. The first tee will give you a really good feeling for what you’re going to see here starting with a dogleg left par 4. This isn’t target golf, and there are generous landing areas ahead of you on all the holes, but if you miss those landing areas from the tees, there’s a chance you’ll end up in the wetlands or water hazards. Water comes into play here on almost every hole so manage your shots well and you’ll score low. Both the front and the back nine’s have challenging par 5’s that will bring you back to play here time and time again. They can be reached in two for the powerful player, but there are also a number of deep bunkers to avoid. Along the left-hand side of the par-4 No. 1 (346 yards from the back tees and 284 yards from the forward tees), you’ll see lots of cypress groves and wetlands. There’s also a pond area on the right. Homes will never be built on No. 1 because of protected natural areas. According to Jed Azinger, the par-4 No. 3 (430 yards from the back tees, 307 from the forward) “is one of the top five holes I’ve ever worked on.” The fairway here swings back toward the clubhouse and provides golfers with a beautiful view. But don’t be mesmerized by the scenery. This is a slight dogleg left around a grandfather oak tree that could prove an obstacle if your ball leans left. It’s that oak tree that Azinger really loves on this hole. “We could have had it removed; we had permission to do so. But we wanted to keep it because it’s 100 years old,” he said. Click Here or call 813-907-7447 to book a tee time! Besides watching out for that giant oak, players also need to be careful about the wetlands that guard the entire right front of the green. Right from the beginning of the course, you’ll also have to watch out for the par-3s, some of the most demanding holes on the course, particularly from the back tees because of their length. The shortest and perhaps the easiest of them is No. 5 (199 yards from the back tees and 130 from the forward). All the rest are more than 200 yards from the tips. The No. 7 hole is the signature hole of the Heritage Isles course. It’s a double dogleg par-5 that is 558 yards from the back tees and 405 yards from the forward. You’ll need to make a long carry over wetlands right off the tee. As you travel along the fairway you have to avoid the environmentally sensitive wetlands along both sides. No hunting for your ball if you run off course. There’s a dog-right off the tee and then a dog-left on your way to the green. It’s definitely a risk-reward hole. The professionals’ strategy would be to hit your drive to the right side of the fairway and then try to hit the risk shot to the green over the dogleg left. You’ll have a carry over palmetto and brush to hit it in two. For those with less courage, it’s possible to lay up on the right-hand side to avoid the out-of-bounds shot. No. 9 (312 yards from the back tees and 303 yards from the forward) is another of Jed Azinger’s favorites. “It’s a par-4, dogleg left,” he said, “that really catches your eyes as you drive into the course. It’s a well-bunkered hole with water down the left-hand side. You have to go over a bridge to reach the forward tees. It’s actually a semi-island hole.” Although you’ll find less danger from wetlands on the back nine, the layout is very similar on the back of the course. The signature hole there is one of those huge par-3s, No. 16 (249 yards from the back tees and 129 from the forward). There are wetlands to the right and water on your left as you take your tee shot. You also have to carry over a large, deep bunker on the right side of the green. For shorter hitters, there is room in front of the green to lay up. The 18th hole, a par-4 that is 399 yards from the back tees and 275 from the forward, is a sharp dogleg right with wetlands on the left side and a lake on the right. This is another fairway that offers the chance to try to cut the dogleg. You can hit across the lake to a landing area in a second fairway. Or you can lay up on the left-hand side in the first fairway and use a middle iron to get to the green. After your round be sure to visit our clubhouse and have a drink or something to eat while you discuss your strategy for the next time you visit Heritage Isles!

The article was titled EVERYONE LOVES DENT, and was written by the illustrious sports writer; Michael Bamberger. Mr. Bamberger is one of the country’s most elegant writers on golf. His versatility as a writer and his lucid, open style are hallmarks of his work. Bamberger joined SPORTS ILLUSTRATED as a senior writer in 1995 after 13 years as a newspaper reporter. Michael Bamberger’s Jim Dent Article The week preceding this year’s Masters, Mr. Bamberger visited The Jim Dent/Rick Bradshaw School of Golf at Heritage Isles Golf and Country Club in New Tampa. Michael immediately was drawn to our Golf School’s library of instruction books which is available for students and instructors to refer to during their lesson. Michael’s article described his visit as; “Dent and I drove from his home to a public course outside Tampa called Heritage Isles, where he owns a golf school with a teaching pro named Rick Bradshaw. His business partner likes a round, stress-free swing, and Jim Dent is his Exhibit A. Bradshaw has a collection of worn-out, marked-up and taped instruction books—by Hogan, Percy Boomer, Jimmy Ballard, Homer Kelley and others—and during our visit Dent studied closely various pictures. He is still a student of the game and loves referring to Ben Hogan’s perfect golf swing”. These books plus hundreds more in my weather beaten library are what substantiate the history of golf instruction and add to my knowledge of what works and why from the beginning of golf in the late 1800’s to present modern day instruction. It is firmly my belief to be extremely well read and knowledgeable of virtually all past and present golf instruction if you are to attempt to instruct individuals to swing a golf club. The close to 40 years of my own personal teaching experience has enabled me to develop my own teaching and communication style. In addition partnering with a tour professional the likes of Jim Dent, who has been categorized by fellow golf professionals as having one of the most powerful and effortless golf swings of all time, has presented an immeasurable amount of experience for me as a passionate golf teacher. Michael Bamberger allowed me to video his golf swing and then we analyzed it together. He is a very good golfer and I soon learned he had immense knowledge of golf instruction. We looked at a very old video of Ben Hogan practicing and hitting drives into the ocean from the backyard of a house next to Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach Florida. Seminole, still extremely exclusive, is now ranked #22 in the world, and back then when they shot the Hogan video it was ranked in the world’s top 10 golf courses. Michael was the only person I have ever shown the exclusive Hogan video to that already knew it existed. He spent about an hour with Jim Dent and me talking about golf instruction and hitting golf balls. In addition, he seemed very impressed with my 280 yard one hand drives to exemplify how effortless the golf swing should be. I thank Michael Bamberger for visiting and writing such a wonderful article about the man and golfer Jim Dent in the Masters Preview of Sports Illustrated Magazine as well as mentioning myself and our golf school.
