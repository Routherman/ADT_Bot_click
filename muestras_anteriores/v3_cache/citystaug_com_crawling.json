Quick Facts Early Life, Family, and Career War of 1812 Writing “The Star-Spangled Banner” Stance on Slavery Death and Legacy Who Was Francis Scott Key? Lawyer Francis Scott Key is remembered for writing the lyrics of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which is now the national anthem of the United States. Born in 1779, Key lived much of his life in Maryland, though he also served as a district attorney for Washington, D.C. During the War of 1812 , he witnessed the British’s unsuccessful attack on Fort McHenry in Baltimore and was inspired to write a poem titled “Defence of Fort M’Henry.” Set to music, the poem became “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which President Herbert Hoover made the national anthem in 1931, decades after Key’s death in 1843 at age 63. For his lyrics, Key was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Francis Scott Key BORN: August 1, 1779 DIED: January 11, 1843 BIRTHPLACE: Frederick County, Maryland SPOUSE: Mary Tayloe Lloyd CHILDREN: 11 ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Leo Early Life, Family, and Career Getty Images Terra Ruba, the birthplace of Francis Scott Key Francis Scott Key was born on August 1, 1779, in Frederick County, Maryland, to a wealthy clan on the Terra Rubra plantation. He was educated at home until age 10 then attended an Annapolis grammar school. He went on to study at St. John’s College, ultimately returning to his home county to set up practice as a lawyer. Key wed Mary “Polly” Tayloe Lloyd in the early 1800s, and the couple had 11 children. By 1805, he’d set up his legal practice in Georgetown, then an independent municipality within Washington, D.C., area. War of 1812 By the early 1810s, the United States had entered into conflict with Britain over the kidnapping of American seamen and the disruption of trade with France. The ensuing hostilities became known as the War of 1812 . Although opposed to the war due to his religious beliefs and believing that the disagreement could be settled without armed conflict, Key nonetheless served in the Georgetown Light Field Artillery. British forces captured Washington, D.C., in 1814. Taken prisoner was Dr. William Beanes, who also happened to be a colleague of Key. Due to his work as an attorney, Key was asked to help in the negotiation of Beanes’ release and, in the process, traveled to Baltimore where British naval forces were located along Chesapeake Bay. He and Colonel John Skinner were able to secure Beanes’ freedom, though their return was delayed by a British attack on land. Writing “The Star-Spangled Banner” Getty Images Francis Scott Key’s handwritten draft of his poem “Defence of Fort M’Henry” Getty Images When set to music, the “Defence of Fort M’Henry” poem became “The Star-Spangled Banner.” On September 13, 1814, Key was at sea off the coast of Baltimore with Colonel John Skinner and the now-free Dr. William Beanes. The three men watched the British wage a day-long assault on Fort McHenry. After continual bombing, to Key’s surprise, the British weren’t able to destroy the fort, and Key noted upon the dawning of the next morning a large U.S. flag was flying. (Mary Young Pickersgill had sewn it at the request of the fort commander.) The British ceased their attack and left the area. Key immediately wrote down the words for a poem that he continued composing at an inn the next day. The work, which relied heavily on visualizations of what he witnessed, came to be known as the “Defence of Fort M’Henry” and was printed in handbills and newspapers, including the Baltimore Patriot . The poem was later set to the tune of a drinking song by John Stafford Smith, “To Anacreon in Heaven,” with the title “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Over the years, “The Star-Spangled Banner” continued to be held up as a musical symbol of the United States, though it also faced critiques for its depiction of violence and unwieldy lyrics. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson declared “The Star-Spangled Banner” should be played at official events. On March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover , along with Congress, declared the song the national anthem of the United States. Key’s lyrics earned him a posthumous induction to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. More about the Stars and Stripes Betsy Ross Probably Didn’t Design the U.S. Flag Stance on Slavery After the War of 1812, Key continued working in law and, in 1833, became Washington, D.C., district attorney. In this capacity, he oversaw proceedings that upheld the system of slavery by prosecuting abolitionists . Key was an enslaver himself, though he went on record as saying that the system of slavery was full of sin and “a bed of torture.” His complex views on race also led him to help establish the American Colonization Society, which advocated for the transport of Black people to Africa. Information on Key’s relationship to race and his Washington legal career can be found in the Jefferson Morley book Snow-Storm in August: Washington City, Francis Scott Key, and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835 . Death and Legacy After falling ill with pleurisy, Key died on January 11, 1843, in Baltimore. He was 63 years old. Key is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery near the city of Frederick, Maryland. Although his legacy endures through “The Star-Spangled Banner,” Key has also been memorialized as the namesake of several schools and bridges. A monument for the famed lyricist and slaveholder stood in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park for many years before protesters toppled it during a demonstration against racial injustice in June 2020. In March 2024, Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge on Interstate 695 collapsed after a cargo ship ran into one of its supporting pillars. Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

Learn More-Franciscans of the Third Order Regular University President Fr. Malachi Van Tassell T.O.R., Ph.D Assumed the office of President at Saint Francis University on May 12, 2014, with his official inauguration taking place on October 4, 2014. In the summer of 2018, the university undertook a major institutional restructuring.  The ultimate goal of the re-structuring was to keep a Saint Francis University education affordable and accessible.  Building on the solid foundation of Catholic and Franciscan identity, the university affirmed its vital academic programs in health sciences and business. In addition, the university made significant investments in STEAM programs, including engineering and the arts, and affirmed its commitment to intercollegiate athletics competition at the NCAA Division One level. In 2019, the university launched Francis Worldwide School of Continuing Studies, a school dedicated to offering career-focused, flexible programs for students looking to continue their education.  In his tenure, Saint Francis University has created several new academic programs. The School of Continuing Studies recently launched its first research-based doctorate program delivered in a hybrid format for working professionals across various disciplines.  A commitment to a relevant, market-driven academic portfolio is a hallmark of Father’s leadership. Successful capital projects include the Shields School of Business, School of Health Sciences and Education experiential learning commons, and several athletics-related projects.  In the summer of 2022, construction will commence for the Connors Family Fine Arts Center, future home of the Resinski Black Box Theater and a newly renovated building for the Occupational Therapy program. In addition, significant progress continues on the capital campaign for the School of Health Sciences and Education at Sullivan Hall and the Immaculate Conception Chapel. Father is a member of the NCAA Division One Presidential Forum, member and past Chair of the Northeast Conference Council of Presidents, and a member and past Chair of the Association of Franciscan Colleges and Universities.  Previously, Father Malachi served as Minister Provincial of the Sacred Heart Province and Chairman of the Board of Franciscan University, where he led a successful presidential search. Prior to the Presidency, he spent twelve years at the university as an assistant professor of accounting (full-time and adjunct).  He previously served as the treasurer and vicar provincial of the Franciscan Friars, Sacred Heart Province. Fr. Malachi professed vows as a Franciscan in 1999 and was ordained to the priesthood in 2004.  He has a Ph.D. in higher education leadership from Capella University, a master’s degree in taxation from Arizona State University, and an undergraduate degree in accounting and Spanish from Franciscan University.  A certified public accountant, he worked for Coopers & Lybrand in Phoenix, Arizona, and Arthur Andersen in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as a tax accountant before becoming a Franciscan. Education B.A., Franciscan University M. Tax., Arizona State University M. Div., Washington Theological Union Ph.D., Capella University Certified Public Accountant (Arizona) Board of Trustees The most prominent steward of this institution is the Saint Francis University Board of Trustees who are entrusted with overseeing the mission, vision, and advancement of the University.  The Board of Trustees was established in 1967, replacing the former Board of Control, which had been comprised solely of Franciscan friars.

Learn more about who we are, what we do, and our passion for the Good News of Jesus Christ. Beliefs Leadership History Beliefs Leadership History What We Believe Grounded in the Gospel We never tire of hearing about the good news of what God has done for the world in Jesus. Our worship is steeped in Holy Scripture, and we encounter God’s Word in the prayers we pray, in the songs we sing, and in our preaching. Every week, we hear about the burdens of the world, the love of God in Jesus, and the promise of mercy and forgiveness. Focused on Formation At the end of every service we are sent out with a blessing that prays that the “peace of God” will “keep our hearts and minds in the knowledge and Love of God.” We take that promise very seriously and endeavor to challenge both the heart and the mind with the good news of God in Christ. We seek to equip people so they can not only deepen their faith, but bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ into their homes, schools, and workplaces. Engagement of the heart and mind lies at the core of what we do here and is integrated into our programs and teaching for all ages. Formation Opportunities Click below to access our 2024 Annual Parish Report. 2024 Annual Parish Report Embracing our Anglican Heritage St. Francis in the Fields is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. We are committed to the “faith once delivered to all the saints” (Jude 4), which we share with Anglicans around the world: We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the revealed Word of God. We believe that The Nicene Creed is the sufficient statement of the Christian Faith. We believe in the centrality of the two Sacraments instituted by Christ: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We believe in the leadership of bishops, who lead our churches in the lineage of the Apostles. Meet our Clergy & Staff The Rev. Clint Wilson Rector Fr.

They were in search of a place to worship God and a Christian environment in which to raise their children. They rented a small Baptist church, where they and their 31 children attended their first service on Christmas Eve, 1946. The Rev. Robert Clingman was called to serve as the first rector. Sunday School classes were held at Walter Bader’s grocery store, and adult confirmation classes took place at the Chick Inn. Coming Home By 1948, the congregation had outgrown the small Baptist chapel. They purchased seven and a half acres of wooded land on Wolf Pen Branch Road and built a beautiful Georgian sanctuary and rectory there. They started a primary day school, and the church soon became a center of community activity, offering baby care, tuberculosis clinics, and other community services. Legacy of Service In 1953, the Rev. Stephen R. Davenport was called as rector, a role he would fill for nearly 30 years. The church became known for its strong music program, a legacy we uphold to this day. In 1954, the church added a new education wing and fellowship hall to support the growing community. The day school became St. Francis School, with a school grounds in Goshen and later a high school in downtown Louisville. New Fruit The parish continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The children of the founders brought their own children to church, where they were joined by families from the growing neighborhood. In 1982, the Rev. Robert T. Jennings was called as rector. By the 1980s, St. Francis was the largest Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Kentucky. The church grew so much that in the early 1990s, it outgrew the worship space and services were held in the fellowship hall. In 1995, we moved into our current worship space, which offers more room for worship while staying true to the lovely design of the original church. Forward in Faith The Rev. Robert T. Jennings retired in 2014 and The Rev. Dr. John D. Koch, Jr. became the fourth rector at St. Francis in the Fields. In February of 2020, The Rev. Clint Wilson joined as the fifth rector. We’ve continued to adapt to the changing needs of our community and world while staying true to the vision of our founders: beautiful worship, robust Christian formation, and energetic mission in our community and around the world.

This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Governmentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, \"Schooljobs\", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use . Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in the Terms of Use . Any dispute related to privacy is subject to the Terms of Use and this Policy, including limitations on liability. This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion. We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below. Where We Are a Service Provider Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information or your precise geolocation information for timeclock tracking, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a \"data processor\" or \"service provider\" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Any use of analytics or engagement technologies that process personal data, including tools that analyze user behavior or associate usage with identifiers, are implemented solely as a data processor or service provider in these scenarios, and such data is not used by NEOGOV for its own commercial purposes. Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you. For example, a Customer may choose to enable collection of biometric or precise location data for its employees using our time and attendance product. We process such data only at the direction of that Customer and do not use it for our own purposes. Further, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services. Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer. Personal Data We Collect About You and Why. In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year.

Cookies, pixel tags (“web beacons”), HTML Storage Objects, web tags, and embedded scripts within our communications and on our Services to collect data related to usage, location, device and logs. Among other reasons, we use various cookies and other tracking technologies to provide our Services, authenticate users when visiting our Services, for security purposes (e.g., to prevent fraudulent use of the Services and protect our Services generally), track your preferences, provide personalized recommendations of content, features, and Services, deliver more relevant ads to you as you browse the web, including ads on websites and applications other than on our Services, and help us understand how our websites and communications are being used. For more information on Cookies see the “Cookies and similar Tracking Technologies; “Do Not Track” section immediately below. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include: A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things. HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Microsoft Edge , Google Chrome , Mozilla Firefox , or Apple Safari ). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services. Online Analytics and Advertising Online Analytics We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Hubspot, LinkedIn, Hotjar, Gainsight and others. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. In some cases, we may also associate analytics and usage data with identifiers such as your name or email address, but only as needed to enable our Customers to analyze user engagement, feature usage, or onboarding effectiveness. These tools are used solely on behalf of our Customers to support the Services they direct us to provide.  For example, we use Gainsight to support in-product analytics and engagement, on behalf of our Customers, and subject to our role as a service provider. Tailored Online Advertising We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. These third-party advertising technologies may include Google Ads, DoubleClick, Twitter, AddThis, ShareThis, and others. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.

Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA. Shine the Light California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at privacy@neogov.com . Do Not Track Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here . Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR. Data Controllers and Processors. Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing. Lawful Basis for Processing. For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including: Consent. In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy. Legitimate Interest. We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests. Performance of a Contract We process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service. Other Legal Bases. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims. Automated Decision Making and Profiling. We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you. Data Security and Integrity. We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us. Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password. Retention and Removal. For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law. Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application. Right to Revise. We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

Copyright Infringement.   Our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Copyright-infringing materials found on the Services can be identified and removed via our process listed below, and you agree to comply with such process in the event you are involved in any claim of copyright infringement to which the DMCA may be applicable. If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed. We do not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. We may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, we are required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content (“Alleged Infringer”). The Alleged Infringer is allowed under the law to send us a counter-notification. Notices and counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular activities or communications through the Service. We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney. To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by regular mail only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice. A DMCA notice must: Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, “My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].”); Identify the content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work.
