Girls looked in good spirits. Paco Torres No Title February 17, 2023 I have recently become a regular here. I try to make it every Tuesday night for dinner, a cigar or two and a few drinks. First of all their happy hour is unbeatable, entrance dinner and a drink for $5! Secondly their staff is always friendly and warm. From Charles the doorman to Marlon and Nicolas the managers and all the other staff. They are always friendly and happy to make sure you are having a good time and everything is perfect. If you’re looking for a fun night out or a relaxing place to enjoy a cigar this is the place to go. Brad Smith No Title February 17, 2023 I had a great time there while on vacation this weekend. Even though it was a slow night cause it was Sunday I had a good time, got a dance from a beautiful Cuban girl named Suzie, she was wonderful and friendly, if Im ever in Miami again I would definitely make a stop here . Raul Lopez No Title February 17, 2023 I have visited Gold Rush Cabaret multiple times in my out and about excursions, and I have never been disappointed. The erotic dancers are versatile and beyond courteous. A place to be yourself, Gold Rush Cabaret smashes other strip clubs. This is by far the greatest strip club in South Florida. Michael Anthony Alberta No Title February 17, 2023 Security just threw up Millions of dollars to the garbage telling me that I can’t go in if I don’t wear pants. If I was the owner of the place I just fired those guys, ‘cause wearing any type of clothes shouldn’t be an impediment Jhon Murgueitio Rojas WHATSAPP US For Bookings, Prices and more Infos MESSAGE NOW Or call us +1 347 759-6146 Book Your VIP Table Contact your 24/7 Global Nightlife Concierge for last minute booking and further questions.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Susannah Breslin covers the business of sex. Aug 29, 2015, 08:53pm EDT Aug 31, 2015, 06:23am EDT Share Save This article is more than 10 years old. If you drive north from Miami, Florida, on Interstate 95 to Miami Gardens and make a series of turns, you'll end up at the front door of Tootsie's Cabaret , the biggest strip club in America. On the late Friday afternoon I was there, the massive parking lot was filling up slowly. A valet directed me to the VIP parking, where I was greeted and led down a maze of hallways to an office past a stack of shelves overflowing with a rainbow of Tootsie's T-shirts to the office of Ed Anakar, the director of operations and president of RCI Management Services Inc. In other words, he works for RCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly-traded, Houston-based corporation that until last year was known as Rick's Cabaret. Today, RCI operates over 40 establishments in the hospitality space, among them: Rick's Cabaret and Vivid Cabaret in New York City, Bombshells in Houston and Down in Texas Saloon in Austin, and Club Onyx in Charlotte and The Seville in Minneapolis. You can find RCI on the NASDAQ under RICK. At Tootsie's Cabaret in Miami Gardens, they'll leave the light on for you. (Photo credit: Tootsie's Cabaret) Anakar is 47, lean and intense, and wearing a white shirt and dress pants. For the most part, he is deadly serious. One can imagine his line of work demands it. After all, a career in the gentleman's club business must be akin to herding chickens -- only, in this case, the chickens are fully-nude dancers performing on a stage with a 30-foot stripper pole and the coop is a 74,000-square-foot strip club housed in a gargantuan building that was previously the home of a BJ's Wholesale Club. \"I don't look at it just as an adult business,\" Anakar says. \"This is a hospitality business.\" Between opening at noon and closing tomorrow at six in the morning, he expects to see some 1,300 to 1,500 customers come through the front doors. The stage will host somewhere around 150 women. As Anakar sees it, his clientele makes the pilgrimage here for a \"full entertainment experience -- with a view.\" Lapdances are on the menu, but, he says, it's more than that: \"We have a lot of guys come in here for the company.\" Increasingly, more women and couples are showing up to see the non-stop show. Here, some groups host bachelor parties -- others throw divorce parties. Both Drake (\"I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up / Second floor at Tootsie's, getting shoulder rubs\") and Pitbull (\"Pink pony, scarlet / Tootsies, I love that\") have paid homage to Tootsie's in their lyrics. A full lapdance will cost you $20. What I'm trying to get Anakar to tell me is what he's doing to bring in a whole new generation of young men who may be more inclined to turn to their screens to get turned on than to head to the strip club. But he's not in the porn business , and these aren't cam girls demanding tokens . For better or for worse, he's in the flesh business. I ask him if one day virtual reality or some future tech device we can't yet envision could threaten his livelihood. \"I don't think it beats reality,\" he says. He leans forward to drive home his point to me and underscore what he's selling. In the case of you and your machine, \"You don't have the true fantasy, which is reality.\" From there, we head out to the club. The place is so big they've got a giant room in the back for making the furniture upon which the laps get their dances. One open door reveals endless rows of lockers; sexily-clad dancers mingle in their dressing room. Out on the dark floor, the music is thudding, and Knockers, Tootsie's oversized sports bar restaurant outfitted with more TV screens than I can count, is getting ready to serve Tootsie's Fried Lobster Trail (I tried it -- it's not bad). In the main room, which feels like God scooped up all of Vegas in one hand, shaped it into a ball, and deposited it in Tootsie's, it's hard to miss the grand stage. At any given time, three women are hard at work on it. Typically, the one at center stage is either barely dressed, getting undressed, or naked, and in the wells on either side of the elevated stage and behind the brass tipping rail, two totally nude dancers are working the guys who have tips at the ready. We pass by a giant fake palm. There's a Caesars-esque area called Cleopatra's Barge, a section that's a replica of the Moulin Rouge in Pigalle, and a theater marquee floating above the stage that's promoting an upcoming NFL kickoff party. The bars are fully stocked, and everything is suffused in a red glow that makes you feel like you're somewhere you're not supposed to be with nowhere else to go so you may as well join the others sitting in chairs who are enjoying the spectacle of this X-rated Disneyland. Upstairs, I get a tour of the $300-an-hour sky boxes, and Anakar deposits me in the VIP lounge. Nearby, a woman in a red bikini is hanging upside down from a pole, anchored by one leg, her arms overhead. Her expression is blank. I smile; she doesn't smile back. There are girls in complicated swimsuits, strappy lingerie, and straight up stripperwear everywhere you look. Downstairs, the crowd is mixed: The handsy nerd at the rail, the 50-something businessman still wearing his tie who sits with his chin in his hand, his elbow on the table in front of him, gazing dreamily at the girl gyrating a few feet away, and the 20-something couple at the small table with a bucket of Coronas who don't really look like they've done this before (awkward). On the black leather sofa to my left, a massage girl is sitting on the back of the sofa, giving the guy in front of her a shoulder massage. He's talking to his buddies, seemingly oblivious. Eventually, Kimmy appears and sits next to me. She's worked at Rick's Cabaret and Tootsie's for seven years. \"Everyone's like family,\" she explains. She has dark blonde hair, stands five-nine, and started working in the business at 18. \"I like dancing a lot,\" she says. \"I'm not shy. I have a lot of spunk.\" I ask her how much she expects she'll make tonight. Between $800 and $1,000, she estimates -- that's average. In all likelihood, she'll perform in the neighborhood of 50 lapdances, which sounds like a lot of work to me, but, she insists, \"You don't have to do that much work.\" I ask her what her customers really want. \"Some guys wants love and attention,\" she says. \"Some guys just want to talk.\" Plus, she says, this is really the best place around to get good lemon pepper buffalo wings. So far, she's bought a house and put herself through college working here. \"If you're smart and invest your money properly, this can be a really lucrative career,\" she advises before returning to the hustle.
