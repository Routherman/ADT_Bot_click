Bay 13 is focused on a deliberate and comfortable environment serving quality beer, and quality food with friendly, professional service in a relaxed atmosphere. With the addition of a very deliberate, high-quality, and beer-focused menu, we are aiming to bring something truly unique to the South Florida beer market.

Our Team Nick Sharp - Owner Nick came to Miami in 2012 as an accountant at a dairy commodity trading company. In 2014 with his wife Teresa, opened Threefold Café on Giralda Avenue in the Gables aiming to recreate a small piece of their hometown of Melbourne, which is so heavily served with great coffee and all-day breakfast. Since that time Nick has undertaken a variety of ventures in Miami from Miami Beach to Key Biscayne but his home is definitely Coral Gables where he has four operating locations. Nick is an active member in the community serving on the Executive Board of the Coral Gables Business improvement district as well as a variety of other panels, committees, and task forces. Greg Berbusse - Head Brewer Hailing from Little Rock, AR Greg was recruited to Bay 13 Brewery and Kitchen at the end of 2019, moving down early in the near year of 2020. If Miami wasn’t a large enough shock to the system, the first port of call was being shipped off to Australia to do a 10-day whirlwind brewery tour of Sydney, Canberra, and Melbourne.  Back to Bay 13 to oversee the final (and long) stages of the construction process, Greg was finally able to begin brewing in November for the December grand opening. The starting range was a huge hit with the most common comment being “a menu with beer-flavored beer”!

Owner and Aussie Nick Sharp named his latest gastronomical venture after a section of the Melbourne Cricket Ground infamous for its rowdy spectators. They offer beers brewed in-house, an extensive Australian wine list and three different menus: Lunch, dinner and all-day. âYou can come here and spend $20 and have a couple beers. You can come here and spend $2,000 on wine,â said Sharp during Bay 13âs grand opening weekend. On the east end of Alhambra, directly across the street from the Hyatt Regency, the brewery has both indoor and outdoor seating â and an indoor and outdoor bar. The interior is spacious with the massive steel brewing vats on display. The exterior is inviting, with tables and cushioned chairs on artificial grass or under umbrellas on the patio. âItâs going to be welcoming, itâs going to be fresh, itâs going to be something different in South Florida.â Nick Sharp Owner, Bay 13 Brewery and Kitchen I donât know what I like better about Bay 13: The craft beers or their names. The Old Man is a very flavorful brew. A Belgian-style wheat ale, it has a âfluffyâ mouthfeel. My personal favorite is the Woop Woop. Partially because of its name â how could you not love it? â and partially because of its earthy and herbal notes from Australian hops. Hailing from Arkansas, Greg Berbusse is the head brewer. Unlike the casual pub food served at most breweries, Bay 13âs menu is elevated. It ranges from a zesty watercress salad with soft boiled egg, to fresh scallops served with corn sauce and radish, to strip loin steak that comes with a killer potato puree and a savory brown ale espresso sauce. Hats off to Head Chef Bjorn De La Cruz. Sharp emphasizes Australian hospitality at Bay 13. Whether youâre a day laborer or an investment banker, âItâs going to be welcoming, itâs going to be fresh, itâs going to be something different in South Florida,â he says. ← Gift Shops for Curious Travelers Raquel Regalado → Share This Post: Current Issue City Beautiful 1200 Anastasia Ave. Ste 115.

And maybe avocado on toast… With the move to a brand new city in 2012, owners, Nick and Teresa began searching for the specialty coffee lifestyle as they knew it, from their home, in Melbourne, Australia. In 2014, their first café opened in the Coral Gables neighborhood of Miami. Bringing a tried and tested concept inspired by the Melbourne cafe scene, Threefold Cafe executes breakfast and lunch fare consisting mainly of locally sourced ingredients, which rotates and changes regularly.
