As a guest of Spectrum Resort Orlando, you’re just steps away from the fun and relaxation of the Reunion Resort Water Park. Conveniently located right next door, it offers the perfect combination of family-friendly excitement and peaceful poolside comfort. With splash zones, winding water slides, a lazy river, and plenty of places to relax, it’s an easy and enjoyable way to spend the day without leaving the resort. Lazy River Settle into a complimentary tube and enjoy a peaceful ride along the winding 1000 foot lazy river. As you glide past gentle waterfalls and drift beneath the towering waterslide, the calm atmosphere invites you to slow down and take in the lush surroundings. It’s a perfect way to relax, reconnect with loved ones, and enjoy the warmth of the Florida sun at your own pace. Water Slide For a splash of excitement, head to the waterslide nestled right within the heart of the Water Park. With smooth curves and a quick descent, it’s just the right balance of fun and refreshment. Kids love the ride, and adults often find themselves joining in for one more go. Easy to access and designed for all-day enjoyment, the slide adds a playful touch to an otherwise relaxing setting. Aquatic Playground This vibrant, island-inspired play area is full of interactive fun. Kids can dart through gentle spray zones, climb across rope bridges, and dodge bursts from playful water cannons. Every few minutes, the excitement builds as a giant bucket fills and tips, sending a refreshing splash over the entire structure. It’s an energetic centerpiece made for nonstop family fun. Fun Pool Games Just steps from the pool, guests can take a break from the water and join in on a variety of classic lawn and poolside games. From friendly rounds of ping pong and corn hole to hula hoop challenges, relay races, and oversized Connect Four, there’s something for every age and energy level. Private Cabanas Soak up some sun or relax in your private, shaded retreat. The tranquil poolside cabanas are the embodiment of serenity. Learn More Reunion Resort Pools In addition to Spectrum’s private pool located at our clubhouse, guests also have full access to four additional pools located throughout Reunion Resort. Each one offers its own atmosphere, perfect for seeking a peaceful morning dip, a spot to unwind with a good book, or space for the whole family to splash and play. You’re never far from the perfect place to relax, refresh, and enjoy the moment.

Specializing in golf-centered clubs and resorts, Atlanta-based Kingwood International currently owns and operates Kingwood Country Club & Golf Resort and Achasta Golf Resort community, both in North Georgia, and the eco-friendly Plantation on Crystal River in Central West Florida. The purchase of Reunion Resort from real estate investment firm Lubert Adler was finalized Friday, Feb. 8. “Reunion Resort is a perfect complement to our portfolio of upscale golf communities and resorts,” stated Richard Nasser, president of the Resort Division of Kingwood International Resorts. “With its varied accommodation options, world-class golf and exceptional amenities, Reunion is known as an ideal resort for guests who want to experience everything Orlando has to offer. Our goal is to enhance the guest experience at every turn and drive awareness to the next level.” Kingwood International has plans to make significant investments in Reunion Resort, such as the addition of 1,200 rental accommodations, including a new 400-room hotel with significant convention and meeting facilities to enhance the resort’s condominium and private home rentals. There will also be an expansion of the multi-acre Reunion Resort Water Park, with the addition of a wave pool, new water slide, putt-putt golf and a larger, covered food and beverage offering. Kingwood will enact growth initiatives for Reunion’s Club membership as well, including expanded benefits to add exclusivity and value. “We are excited to add Reunion Resort as a key acquisition in our growth strategy for Kingwood International Resorts,” stated Fred Zohouri, Kingwood’s founder and chief executive. “Our plan is to build upon the successes of Reunion’s leadership and frontline hospitality professionals so we can provide our members and guests with extraordinary experiences.” Reunion Resort features 360 resort-style accommodations ranging from luxury multi-room villas to private three- to 13-bedroom vacation homes, as well as 25,000 square feet of meeting and event space. Widely recognized as a top golf destination, Reunion is the only location in the world featuring three signature championship golf courses designed by golfing legends Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson. Amenities at the resort include seven casual and fine dining venues, including an award-winning rooftop steakhouse, elegant indoor and outdoor meeting space, six hydro-grid clay tennis courts, a full-service boutique spa, 10 community pools, fitness center and a five-acre waterpark.

Reunion Resort Water Park Time to splash in! Reunion Resort Water Park is Reunion’s top amenity destination for guests staying within Reunion Resort. Spread out across five acres of land lies a cluster of thrilling slides, water activities, relaxing lazy rivers, and appetizing dining options for guests to enjoy. Throw on your favorite swimsuits and enjoy the various water activities throughout the water park. From twisty water slides that children and adults alike can enjoy to unwinding as you float down the lazy river, there’s something for everyone to love. Guests can also revel in the zero-entry pool or journey over to the on-site splash pad for the little ones to play at. With so much to do here, you can easily make this single activity part of your entire vacation day. After having a blast in the water, take to the nearby games for extra fun at the water park. Choose from ping pong, billiards, ladder ball, foosball, giant chess, corn hole, and even hula hoop activities. It’s another exciting way to get the most out of your Water Park experience. Guests can enhance their visit to Reunion Resort Water Park by renting one of the private cabanas. Give yourself and your family ultimate relaxation and tranquility with a shaded cabana that not only protects you from the sun but your belongings as well. Please see the Water Park front desk for more information on how to rent your private cabana. With all of the energy used during your exciting day at the Water Park, wind down with a mouthwatering meal or refreshing drink from The Grill at the Water Park. Choose from a list of refreshing signature cocktails, like Coastal Paloma or The Floridian Way, or take a swig at the assortment of beer, wine, and other frozen beverage options. And for the grumbles in your stomach, satisfy your hunger with The Grill’s choice of sandwiches, salads, flatbreads, and family-style baskets. Nothing completes a day at the Water Park better than a meal you can truly enjoy. With so much to do and so little time, make sure to add Reunion® Resort Water Park to your thrilling Orlando vacation itinerary. For Water Park hours, please contact the Water Park front desk at (407) 396-3048. Hours vary by season. Our Address Reunion Rentals 7549 Osceola Polk Line Rd.

(July 23, 2020) – Reunion Resort & Golf Club, a full-service resort in Central Florida, has announced the opening of 7593 Chophouse, the resort’s newest fine-dining restaurant. Located on the main floor of the Grande building, just off resort’s elegant lobby, 7593 Chophouse serves an inspired menu of signature steaks, entrees and other chophouse cuts, and a sophisticated wine list. The restaurant’s culinary team is led by Executive Chef Sabrina Greene. “The name is derived from the resort’s street address – 7593 Gathering Drive – but I noticed another connection that is more my style,” said Chef Greene. “The new chophouse features seven amazing sides, five savory enhancements, nine perfectly selected proteins, and three signature sushi rolls – 7593. And with our great selection of hand-crafted cocktails and select wines, it adds up to the perfect dining experience.” Carefully shaped under Chef Greene’s direction, the menu features starters such as ceviche, crispy pork belly, and an artisanal charcuterie board, as well as hand-rolled sushi and extravagant salads. Catering to fans of Eleven, the resort’s popular steakhouse, which was closed earlier this year, the menu showcases USDA Prime steaks – from a New York Strip and 22 oz. bone-in Cowboy Ribeye, to double bone Elk Chops and the 48 oz. Tomahawk Steak for two. “While there are other dining options at Reunion, the new 7593 Chophouse fills a fine-dining void created when we closed Eleven,” said GM Anthony Carll. “We continue to reimagine every aspect of the resort, including our restaurants, to deliver the most exceptional experience possible for our guests.” Adding an extra touch to the steaks and other cuts, the menu includes seven house-made toppings, including au poivre sauce, bordelaise sauce, creamy horseradish, chimichurri sauce, signature steak sauce, crab Oscar and colossal grilled shrimp. Other main entrees include ossobuco, bouillabaisse and chicken & biscuits, to name a few. Signature sides include lobster mac & cheese, truffle fries and duck fat roasted fingerlings, as well as crispy brussels sprouts, poutine tater tots, baked potato, and a sauté mushroom medley. To accompany their meal, guests can choose from a collection of celebrity-themed cocktails named for notable personalities who were known to have enjoyed a round (or two) of golf and who can be seen adorning the restaurant’s walls – Dean Martini, JFK Cape Codder, Hepburn Toast and Ole Babe Ruth, among others. The restaurant’s visible wine cellar also holds an extensive and intriguing collection of international and domestic reds, whites, and sparkling pours. Crisp white linens, leather furniture and fine dinnerware provide a sense of elegance at 7593 Chophouse, while airy ceilings, oversized windows and lush landscaping outdoors offer a relaxed and welcoming feel. While the venue can accommodate up to 104 guests, the restaurant is operating at a limited capacity to meet current social distancing protocols. The private Palmer Room can seat 16 guests, with seating for 10 in the semi-private Watson Room. 7593 Chophouse is open on Friday and Saturday evenings from 5 to 10 p.m. Reservations are required, and available on Open Table. Other dining venues currently open at Reunion Resort include, the Clubhouse and Grande Lobby Sushi Bar. For more information on 7593 Chophouse, visit ReunionResort.com .

Read More Reunion® Resort Nearing Completion of Extensive Golf Course Enhancement Project Reunion® Resort Nearing Completion of Extensive Golf Course Enhancement Project ORLANDO, FLA. (Sept. 16, 2019) – Reunion® Resort & Golf Club is nearing completion of an extensive renovation project encompassing all three of its signature courses. Started in May 2019, the $800,000 enhancement includes complete upgrades to bunkers and landscaping across all greens and is scheduled to be complete this fall. All courses have remained open throughout the project. “We are continuously improving the resort experience here at Reunion and our world-class golf courses were the next project on the list,” stated property General Manager Kevin Baker. “Our popular courses haven’t seen this scale of renovation since the early days of LPGA tournaments at our complex.” The project is being overseen by Florida-based ONEGOLF, Inc., which boasts an impressive 20-year track record in golf construction on courses from the Bahamas to South Korea. The enhancements at Reunion include a robust landscaping design and upgrades to drainage lines and bunkers to prevent washouts and damage to the fairways. The Nicklaus course portion of the project is unique due to the nature of the subsoil on which the course was built. New bunker liners will create a barrier between the course’s clay and sand mixture and bunker sand to help prevent contamination. The Reunion team has also been working with the Nicklaus design team to reduce the size of the bunkers to improve playability and allow for more efficient maintenance. Work on the Arnold Palmer course is complete, with only a few bunkers remaining on Jack Nicklaus, and renovations to the Tom Watson course are expected to be completed by October. “Response from our members and guests so far has been overwhelmingly positive,” stated Baker. “They notice the improvement to the look and play of the courses and are pleased with the end result.” Recognized by Golf Digest (2018) as one of only six of the “Best Golf Resorts in Florida,” Reunion’s three courses offer something unique during each round. Designed by legendary greats, the courses are of championship level with recent enhancements taking them to the next level of experience. Known for its Parkland-style smooth and flowing layout, the Jack Nicklaus course is as deceptive as it is beautiful, with long horizon lines and elevated tee boxes and greens. Highlighted by fast, firm and wide-rolling fairways, the 7,154-yard, par-72 Tom Watson course is as much about strategy as it is about length. And, at the 6,916-yard, par-72 Arnold Palmer course, players experience rollercoaster-like terrain where dramatic elevation changes – some up to 50 feet in places – create a unique variety of risk/reward shots. In addition to the three signature golf courses, guests at Reunion Resort enjoy an array of amenities, including six hydro-grid clay tennis courts, a five-acre waterpark, 10 community pools, a full-service boutique spa, and seven casual and fine-dining venues. The property features 360 resort-style accommodations ranging from luxury multi-room Villas to three- to 13-bedroom vacation homes and was named a 2019 AAA Inspector’s “Best of” Housekeeping hotel. Read More New Clubhouse at Reunion® Resort’s Nicklaus Course Opens New Clubhouse at Reunion® Resort’s Nicklaus Course Opens ORLANDO, FL (Dec. 4, 2018) – Reunion® has opened a stunning new clubhouse at its Signature Design Nicklaus Course. Located on over three acres, the new 12,000 square-foot clubhouse features panoramic views of the course and includes a state-of-the-art fitness center, men’s and women’s locker rooms and showers, a golf lifestyle retail space, an event lawn for group functions and special events, and an upscale sports bar called “Traditions,” complete with an open kitchen and outdoor terrace with views of the 18th green. A tribute to Jack Nicklaus’ masterful layout, the new clubhouse includes furnishings, artwork and memorabilia related to Nicklaus’ decorated career. “We are confident that every member and guest will enjoy this distinctive golf experience,” says Reunion Resort’s General Manager Kevin Baker. “It is always our desire to provide the best in service, facilities and playing conditions. This clubhouse provides an intimate and refreshing location to gather with family and friends, or share the triumphs of a day of championship golf at Reunion.” The new clubhouse is part of a multi-pronged improvement plan at the Nicklaus Course. Before the construction of the clubhouse began, the 17th and 18th holes were re-routed to elevate the finishing experience. Significant bunker improvement work has just been completed, while several spectacular homes have now been built in the surrounding Bear’s Den community – creating a true enclave for golfers. The clubhouse was inspired by the rich heritage of Mediterranean Revival architecture in Florida and in particular the work of Addison Mizner. It features large French doors opening to terraces with dark wood roof overhangs. The roof is shaped with barrel tiles and walls of rough stucco that provide depth and texture, along with ornamental ironwork and cast stone window frames. The interior design is characterized by rich woods and contrasting light walls, textural fabrics, and natural earthy colors such as olive, terracotta, and soft blues. The restaurant floor mimics terracotta tiles found in Mediterranean manors, while the rich millwork with iron metal detailing and beamed ceilings ensures each guest feels a luxurious sense of place. The clubhouse’s dining experience is an upscale sports bar called Traditions. Serving American regional cuisine, the menu is seasonal and local with farm-to-table elements. The bar includes a signature drink menu, including craft cocktails and signature barrel-aged bourbons. The open-air kitchen and service style is designed to be friendly and welcoming, appealing to both members and the local community. On weekends, Traditions offers live musical entertainment making it a perfect gathering place for celebrations large or small. All of the doors to the dining terrace, which overlooks the 18th green, open to allow the entire restaurant to enjoy an afternoon breeze during nice weather months. Opened in 2006, The Nicklaus Course was designed to flow smoothly and gently from tee to green. A target, parkland-style course, it was designed to be a player’s course rather than what is referred to as “resort golf.” While the 7,244-yard layout is not exceptionally long by today’s standards, postage-stamp greens, forced carries that lead to fairway targets sometimes only 50 yards wide and a fair amount of trouble for wayward shots give the course plenty of bite. The Nicklaus Course remained open throughout the Clubhouse construction process. Additionally, Reunion’s two other Signature layouts, the Watson and Palmer Courses, also continued to accommodate guest and member play. Reunion Resort features 360 resort-style accommodations ranging from luxury suites and condos to multi-room villas and private 3-to-13-bedroom vacation homes. Recognized as a top golf destination, Reunion is the only location in the world featuring three signature championship golf courses designed by golf’s greatest legends: Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Tom Watson. The amenity-rich resort also features eight casual and fine dining options including an award-winning rooftop steakhouse, elegant indoor and outdoor meeting spaces, six hydro-grid clay tennis courts, a full-service boutique spa, 10 community pools, and a 5-acre waterpark including slides, a water playground, and a 1,000-ft. lazy river. With various real estate and membership opportunities available, guests can stay for a weekend or become members for life.
