Beer About Mayport Brewing Co. Watch out Jacksonville! There is a new brewery in town – Mayport Brewing Company! Located in Jacksonville, Florida, Mayport Brewing Co. is celebrating its grand opening today so we had to stop in and give them a proper review. Upon entering Mayport Brewing Co. you are immediately hit with a super clean aesthetic that looks more like a fancy, upscale bar than a brewery but that isn’t a bad thing at all. Mayport Brewing is super spacious inside and there is plenty of seating available – they have two bars available, couches, chairs, little tables sprinkled throughout, and a massive outdoor beer garden area. That being said, we were there at 5:30 p.m. during their grand opening and we couldn’t move about the brewery bar freely as it was absolutely packed. I know that is great news for them because it seems like they have a ton of local support but for us it meant waiting about 20 minutes to get two beers. It surely won’t be like that all the time so I will give them the benefit of the doubt but the cocktails are what was killing them as they take longer to make and look up should the bartender not know how to make something. Anyways, let’s move on with the review! Duckpin Bowling – Mayport Brewing Co. The adult games are a pretty cool addition to the brewery as well. I had never heard of Duckpin Bowling until I visited Mayport Brewing but I am definitely a fan now – it is basically like a handheld, mini version of bowling – we will definitely be going back to give it a shot once the crowd that was there during the grand opening has subsided. Bumper Pool – Mayport Brewing Co. In addition to duckpin bowling, they do have a shuffleboard table (my favorite game) ,  traditional pool table as well as a bumper pool table which I had never seen and it looks quite interesting. Okay, now that we’ve gone over the overall look and feel of Mayport Brewing Co. it’s now time to dig into the most important part, our review of the beer! Mayport Brewing Co. Beer Beer on Tap – Mayport Brewing Co. While the name suggests it is a brewery, Mayport Brewing Co. does not brew beer on site but they do have 6 of their own beers on tap as well as a ton of guest taps with some impressive beer that you don’t find too often – they had four different beers from Maine Beer Company which is awesome. Below you can find the complete tap list during their grand opening and the 38 different beers they had on tap: Tap List – Mayport Brewing Co. Flights of beer are not yet available as it is their grand opening but will be in the future. Erik and I wanted to try as many of their beers as we could but we could only get one round as the wait was just too long during the grand opening to go back for another. We will definitely be visiting again to try out some of the guest taps and the remainder of their beers. Being that Erik and I both like IPAs we went with the two that Mayport Brewing Company had to offer, let’s take a quick look at what we thought about them: Porch Pirate Hazy Porch Pirate Hazy – Mayport Brewing Co. Type: Hazy IPA ABV: 6% I ordered their hazy IPA as that is one of my favorite styles of beer and it was pretty tasty I must say – I am looking forward to see what other IPAs they release in the future. Tim Toddler’s DIPA Toddler’s DIPA – Mayport Brewing Co. Type: Double IPA ABV: 8.0% Erik ordered this one which is definitely a west coast style DIPA and he enjoyed it while I will take the hazy for sure – it definitely goes down smooth for a double IPA though so be careful with this one. Tim Despite the chaos of it being the grand opening, I can see Mayport Brewing Co. being a spot we keep an eye out on their tap list for the crazy guest taps they have. I’d be more than happy to stop in after pizza and a beer at Reve Brewing which is right down the road to have a few hard-to-find beers and get in a game of duckpin bowling at Mayport. It’s worth mentioning that with the fancy aesthetic and adult games comes the unfortunate fact that it is 21+ only – no kiddos or dogs allowed. I know this may cause a bit of an uproar for some and coming from someone that completed the entire Jax Ale Trail with my 16–month old I get it but I also understand that Mayport Brewing Co. wants a more adult atmosphere and that is 100% okay – get a babysitter and come check this place out!

The Review Mayport Brewing Co. 4.5 Score Mayport Brewing Co. is the newest brewery to open up in Jacksonville, Florida and has a lot of potential. While I would call it more of a bar with beer on tap, that shouldn't deter you from checking this place out as they have 30+ different beers available, some of which are super hard-to-find and worth the visit. Stop by to get in a game of duckpin bowling while you sip on some craft beer from all over the country.

Although he's a Nebraska native, Garrett, his wife and two children are K-State fans in training. Jake Voegeli Sales & Marketing A former K-State football player from Wichita, Kansas, who bleeds purple with his wife and daughter, Jake's journey into craft beer began in college after committing himself to trying a new six pack each week. Jake loves to challenge his palate with hoppy IPAs, sours and barrel-aged stouts, but also loves a well-crafted, delicate pilsner or a traditional English brown ale. An experienced salesman and marketer both in the craft beer and spirits industries, you'll mostly see Jake up front slinging beers or chatting with guests about beer, K-State football, his favorite Ryan Bingham album or his daughter Chloe.
