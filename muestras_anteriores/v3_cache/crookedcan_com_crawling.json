Get the full story behind our incredible crew that's been serving up superior craft beers, craft cocktails and good vibes to the Columbus community since 2020. How the Can Became \"Crooked\" The Crooked Can journey kicked off with a handful of business and personal trips from Columbus to the Orlando area where the original Crooked Can Brewing Co and Plant Street Market is located.Â The founder, a NW Ohio native and a lifelong friend and college buddy to us, showed us their creation.Â After a few years of discussions and development, we decided to go ahead and figure out how to recreate that magic in our own back yard and Crooked Can Ohio and the Center Street Market was born.Â This allowed us to keep the integrity of our product, though different, sharing our core recipes and consistency, all while remaining locally owned and operated which is important to us.Â It has also enabled us to work alongside the amazing LOCAL artisans within the Center Street Market. Together we have made this a unique experience in Â the heart of the OH-IO. Crafting Community, One Pint at a Time More than just brewers, we're a passionate team of beer enthusiasts dedicated to uniting people over delicious craft brews. From our unique, craveable recipes down to our laid-back taproom vibes, everything we do is an invitation to hang out and be happy. Planting Roots in Hilliard's Good Soil After exploring brewery space all over C-bus, it was clear that the charming, close-knit community of Hilliard was our spirit city. The warm welcome we received from day one affirmed we'd found our forever home to grow some seriously hoppy roots. The Heartbeat of Local Flavor In 2020, we expanded our community hub by opening the Center Street Market -- a vibrant collection of 8 amazing local food vendors. This delicious cornerstone has become a beloved meet-up for catching up with friends over craft brews and epic eats.

The Crooked Can Brewing Company is rooted in the founders’ passion for delicious craft beer. This local craft brewery was built inside the Plant Street Market, an indoor Farmers’ Market consisting of over 20 vendors that focus on local artisan products including retail, food, and beverage. The theme to this unique concept was to create a casual social gathering place for family and friends. The brewery’s culture fosters a free-spirited, laid back approach by enjoying the little things such as a good beer in great company to create a purposeful way of life. Crooked Can’s venue space has a flexible layout which features an indoor brewery and multiple tap rooms, an indoor market and multiple outdoor patio spaces that can host up to 2,500 reception style. 12,000 sq ft Indoor Space 2,500 sq ft Private Event Space 8,000 sq ft Patio Space 2,500 Guests Guest Reception Located in the Historic District of Downtown Winter Garden, Plant Street Market is one of the best new places to host events in the Greater Orlando area. Anchored by Crooked Can Brewing Company , guests enjoy over 15 unique craft beers on tap including multiple local favorites. Whether you are hanging out inside the authentic taproom surrounded by amazing stainless steel brewery equipment, or relaxing on the oak-lined brick paver patio, there is a comfortable spot for everyone. Plant Street Market is like an indoor farmer’s market consisting of over 20 vendors that focus on local artisan products including retail, food, and beverage – a unique experience bringing together elements of quality, craft, local, and fun! From groups of 10 guests to parties of up to 2500 guests, Crooked Can Brewing Company / Plant Street Market is the perfect place for your corporate event. Crooked Can & Avenue Event Group AEG teamed up with Crooked Can within 6 months of them opening their doors in March 2016. Crooked Can hosted 3 events the first 6 months which were mostly handled by in-house staff. AEG made them aware that their brewery would be a great place to host events, but they didn’t see the true value in increasing the utility until they started seeing more traction behind their brand. Once they made the commitment to collaborate with AEG they increased from 3 events in 6 months to 45 the following year.  We have consistently hosted over 50 events per year since! 275% Increase in bookings from 2016-2019! How We’ve Contributed To Crooked Can’s Success AEG has had a dedicated employee working inhouse at Crooked Can since Day 1. This team member is responsible for selling and managing events as well as coordinating with of the vendors at Plant Street Market. We host weekly meetings to inform the owners and managerial team of upcoming events, build marketing strategies, and discuss any issues or updates with vendors at the market. Once we partnered with Crooked Can, we decided to not only connect them with the perfect clients and host awesome events, but build and manage a website to serve as a tool to increase brand awareness and generate leads. The website ended up becoming so much more! The Crooked Can Website won the award for “Best Website” in the publication Unique Venues for 2018. We like to think it’s because it is a state of the art system that combines 3 different websites into one extremely powerful digital tool to include: Plant Street Market (and its 15 vendors), Crooked Can (including their tap rooms, beers, and history) private events and Private Events. We are Different Because We are Invested When AEG signs on a new venue we are fully invested. Not only do we facilitate event bookings, we manage all marketing and sales tools to ensure each venue is constantly visible to our clients. We dedicate our time to ensure each venue is increasing event sales while creating memorable events for everyone. Testimonial “They [AEG] helped us market and organize our event capabilities. They worked hard to bring us clients that were interested in a unique event opportunity. They also took total ownership in managing the client’s expectations from A-Z, making it easy for our staff to help support them and offering clients a world-class experience.” - ROBERT SCOTT Founding Member, Crooked Can Brewing Co.

See below for types of engagements that excite me these days. CHIEF OF STAFF & Operations Support for startups I have spent my entire career building companies and entrepreneurs in which I am personally or financially invested.  I’m usually looking for people and ideas that push the envelope, challenging the prevailing norms of their industry. See below for types of engagements that excite me these days. Revenue-First, Fundraising-Lite Ventures Having done the venture thing, I’m solidly in the camp of entrepreneurs who know the value of securing paid customers early and before investors find comfort in a business. The solid, profitable  businesses run by people who know the value of their equity are very interesting to operators like me. I write small checks (<$25K) and/or add value within the business. Chief-of-Staff Engagements Not only is it lonely as a founder, but you are functionally irreplaceable – the business dies without you.  Many founders thrive with proxy expertise to run projects, meet strategic goals, manage a growing team and other demands on the executive(s). I don’t do coaching – I’m allergic to the idea. It’s sleeves-up, in-the-business work or nothing for me. A Chief of Staff is practical, applied, multi-disciplinary, and capacity-building for founders. I enjoy this work immensely. Spin-Outs / New MarketS / Major pivots Many excellent companies struggle to replicate prior successes in emerging markets and products. The ingredients are often there, but a capable partner to translate the team and offering into a compelling innovation can be valuable. Examples include hardware companies creating a value-added software solution, a platform company creating an allied consulting practice, or a product company turning on ecommerce for the first time. Embedding a practiced entrepreneur can unlock significant potential for emerging opportunities. Add me to your team. Existential Start-Up Mode If a founder can avoid the faux-reality of “Shark Tank” entrepreneurialism, they might find themselves with the 99% of founders wanting to start a real business with personal or borrowed capital. The stakes couldn’t be higher for these people – avoidable mistakes can be deadly to these ventures. I refer to this stage as “existential” business-building – knowing and feeling the rhythm of your business, having to make ends meet to unlock the next incremental opportunity. I help first-time entrepreneurs have enough confidence to make the “jump” by building operating models, validating their offerings (up front and over time) and giving them just enough operational support to avoid the common pitfalls. Bring me on to support your venture. Starting something? Doing it your own way? mark@crookedventures.com Starting something? Doing it your own way? mark@crookedventures.com Starting something?

And like all former psychotherapists, Kyle loves to listen. You could say that’s what inspired him to study sound. You’d be wrong though. It was early 2000s Long Island punk music that did it. (Obviously.) Kyle got his undergrad at UVA and his masters at Hunter College in NYC. He soon began working as a full-time psychotherapist while simultaneously recording bands in his Brooklyn-based recording studio. From there, he mixed for various TV shows, recorded and produced bands, post-mixed films and Internet media, and sound designed as a freelancer and staff engineer in both NYC and LA. In 2016 Kyle moved to the west coast to become a full time Californian. Kyle is also an avid TV-watcher, news-reader, dog-haver, and, totally without bragging, has a lot of plants.

Matt DeGroot He/him/his VP, Production Matt combines his love of cinema and politics to bring you video content—allowing the Crooked hosts to prove they’re more than just a pretty voice. After surviving childhood in the Steve King district of Iowa and five years in D.C.—where he became as comfortable producing an animated short about civil service reform as he was being shoved into a broom closet with Oliva Newton-John by secret service escorting Laura Bush through the Kennedy Center—he escaped to Los Angeles, where he spent the next five years at Buzzfeed trying on rompers, convincing Rob Lowe to be a TV court judge, and traveling the world meeting Olympians and eating ridiculously expensive food. To counteract the hours spent watching movies with his husband, Patrick, he gets his heart racing by hiking with his dog, Jolene; playing on a Hogwarts-themed dodgeball team; and watching far too much MSNBC.
