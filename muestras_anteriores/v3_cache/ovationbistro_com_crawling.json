We look forward to serving you and thank you in advance for giving us the chance. Our names are Joel & Fernando and we own and operate the Ovation Bistro & Bar Restaurants in Polk County. We do it together with our awesome managers and Ovationers, which work so hard to serve the best meals in Polk County. We grew up in Polk County and having worked hard all our lives (not complaining). Our family was a migrant family that moved and worked in the fields all across this great country of ours. The season would determine where we would be, up north in the summer months, Indiana or New York. In the Florida orange groves during the rest of the year, we never complained and in fact are still very proud of work that our parents did to provide for us. We have black and white pictures of them working in the fields in every one of our restaurants. To remind us, what hard work looks like and to remind us that in the United States anything is possible. We were both born and raised in Haines City, FL and both graduated from Haines City High and it was always a dream of ours to have our own business in the area. Always being a have not, we thought, it would be cool to have something one day. After high school, we both joined the military. We both served in the Army and both are Combat Veterans. We actually both served together in Afghanistan and after returning back home in 2006, we both went back to work as cooks and then managers at a big Australian themed steakhouse. This is where we learned our way and the ins and outs of the restaurant business, eventually running our own locations. Managing a restaurant is hard work and long hours, but also fun. Having a passion for BBQ and steaks and enjoying nice wines and whiskies… we asked ourselves, “why can’t we go somewhere to get real good BBQ and have a nice glass of wine or stiff drink?” So we decided one day, while we were smoking some brisket at home that we were going to open our own restaurant, one that was BBQ based but felt like a steakhouse and not like a quick service restaurant. Our new restaurant would not only have great BBQ, but a comfortable atmosphere, a sizeable wine list, full bar, specialty coffees and desserts, we told ourselves, this was in late 2014.

We look forward to serving you and thank you in advance for giving us the chance. Our Story Hello, Our names are Joel & Fernando and we own and operate the Ovation Bistro & Bar Restaurants in Polk County. We do it together with our awesome managers and Ovationers, which work so hard to serve the best meals in Polk County. We grew up in Polk County and having worked hard all our lives (not complaining). Our family was a migrant family that moved and worked in the fields all across this great country of ours. The season would determine where we would be, up north in the summer months, Indiana or New York. In the Florida orange groves during the rest of the year, we never complained and in fact are still very proud of work that our parents did to provide for us. We have black and white pictures of them working in the fields in every one of our restaurants. To remind us, what hard work looks like and to remind us that in the United States anything is possible. We were both born and raised in Haines City, Florida and both graduated from Haines City High and it was always a dream of ours to have our own business in the area. Always being a have not, we thought, it would be cool to have something one day. After high school, we both joined the military. We both served in the Army, and are Combat Veterans We actually both served together in Afghanistan and after returning back home in 2006, we both went back to work as cooks and then managers at a big Australian themed steakhouse. This is where we learned our way and the ins and outs of the restaurant business, eventually running our own locations. Managing a restaurant is hard work and long hours, but also fun. Having a passion for BBQ and steaks and enjoying nice wines and whiskies... we asked ourselves, “Why can’t we go somewhere to get real good BBQ and have a nice glass of wine or stiff drink?” So we decided one day, while we were smoking some brisket at home that we were going to open our own restaurant, one that was BBQ-based but felt like a steakhouse and not like a quick service restaurant. Our new restaurant would not only have great BBQ, but a comfortable atmosphere, a sizeable wine list, full bar, specialty coffees and desserts. We told ourselves this in late 2014. We did it! We jumped off the big ship onto a small raft and the Ovation Bistro & Bar was born! We opened the first location in a little strip mall in Davenport. By grace and hard work our raft is still floating all these years later. We have opened two more locations since 2014 and we have been blessed to receive the support of the local communities that we are in, Davenport, Winter Haven and now Lakeland. Serving More Than Just Meals: How the Ovation Bistro Foundation Gives Back At Ovation Bistro & Bar, great food is only part of the story. Through the Ovation Bistro Foundation, giving back to the Polk County community isn’t just something we do, it’s something we believe in. To date, the Ovation Bistro Foundation has contributed over 200,000 meals to Feeding America Tampa Bay , helping fight food insecurity across Central Florida. But our impact doesn’t stop there. We’ve supported dozens of local charities, awarded scholarships to students, and donated food to high schools, the Sheriff’s Office, and community organizations across the region. From serving BBQ to first responders to helping students achieve their dreams, our mission is simple: be a place that brings people together, inside and outside our restaurants. Thank You For Your Time We are in the restaurants on days that end in “y”; so chances are, if you come by we will be there!

This is illustrated by nothing better than the diverse cuisine that you can find throughout the city. Ovation Bistro is an amazing restaurant where you can see many of these cuisines come together on one menu. You can find all types of food here, but it is an absolute must-visit if you are looking for smokehouse cuisine. Incredible Food The menu is extensive and diverse to the point where you can fall in love with something new each and every time you come back. You can never go wrong with the ribs or the steak, as they are all made from the highest quality cuts of meat and cooked to perfection. Combination plates featuring these, along with brisket and chicken, are some of the most popular items ordered. But specials like Pork Shank Osso Buco and New Zealand Lamb Chops will change your appreciation for food. It is for the quality of these menu items that Ovation Bistro has been voted the #1 smokehouse in all of central Florida. While the menu is constantly packed with unique and delicious meals, the rotating chef selections and specials are what keep people coming back again and again. To complement the amazing food served in the bistro, you will also find a meticulously crafted drink menu. You can find a wide selection of local craft beers and classic domestics on tap, and you can find wine from all over the world. But the specialty cocktails offer something truly unique, like their take on the Long Island Iced Tea in the Ovation Iced Tea and the Blackberry Agave Margarita. You cannot go wrong with this drink menu. Much More than a Great Menu The quality of Ovation Bistro goes far beyond delicious food. The experience of enjoying a meal here is made all the sweeter by the friendliness and attention to detail of the wait staff. The philosophy of inviting and friendly service is very apparent in each and every interaction with all staff, from the bussers to the general manager. Call in for a reservation at (863) 354-6967 or send them an email at davenport@ovationbistro.com to give them some feedback on your experience.
