Fionn is connected to many of the legends of the Fenian Cycle. He first came to prominence after catching and eating the Salmon of Knowledge. Another important legend tells how Fionn met his first wife Sadbh while hunting. She had been transformed into a deer by a druid and after Fionn, caught her she turned into a beautiful woman. She bore Fionn a child, Oisin , before befing transformed again into a deer and separating Fionn from his son for many years. Another tale tells of how Fionn in a jealous rage, pursued the lovers Grainne and Diarmuid across Ireland after they had eloped together. But the most famous legend of Fionn Mac Cumhail surrounds the Giants Causeway in Country Antrim . The story goes that Fionn built the causeway to get to Scotland and battle with a rival giant called Benandonner. When he got there he found that the Scottish giant was asleep but also far bigger than himself, so Fionn returned back across the causeway. When Benandonner woke up he came across the causeway intent on fighting Fionn. Fionn's wife dressed up her husband as a baby and when Benandonner arrived she said Fionn wasn't home and to be quiet not to wake up the baby. When Benandonner saw the ‘baby' he decided that if the baby was that big, Fionn must be massive. So he turned tail and fled back across the causeway ripping it up as he went. All that remains are the ends, here at the Giant's Causeway and on the island of Staffa in Scotland where similar formations are found.

      "text": "Monitor email sending using Amazon SES event publishing - Amazon Simple Email Service Monitor email sending using Amazon SES event publishing - Amazon Simple Email Service Documentation Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide How event publishing works with\n                configuration sets and message tags Fine-grained feedback for email\n                campaigns How to use event publishing Event publishing terminology Monitor email sending using Amazon SES event\n            publishing To enable you to track your email sending at a granular level, you can set up Amazon SES to\n        publish email sending events to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon Pinpoint, Amazon Simple Notification Service,\n        or Amazon EventBridge based on characteristics that you define. You can track several types of email sending events, including sends, deliveries, opens,\n        clicks, bounces, complaints, rejections, rendering failures, and delivery delays. This\n        information can be useful for operational and analytical purposes. For example, you can\n        publish your email sending data to CloudWatch and create dashboards that track the performance of\n        your email campaigns, or you can use Amazon SNS to send you notifications when certain events\n        occur. How event publishing works with\n                configuration sets and message tags To use event publishing, you first set up one or more configuration\n                sets . A configuration set specifies where to publish your events and\n            which events to publish. Then, each time you send an email, you provide the name of the\n            configuration set and one or more message tags , in the form of\n            name/value pairs, to categorize the email. For example, if you advertise books, you\n            could name a message tag genre , and assign a value of sci-fi or western , when you send an email\n            for the associated campaign. Depending on which email sending interface you use, you either provide the message tag\n            as a parameter to the EmailTags field of the SendEmail API operation or add the message tag to the\n            SES-specific email header X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS . For more information about\n            configuration sets, see Using configuration sets in Amazon SES . In addition to the message tags that you specify, SES also adds auto-tags to the messages you send. You do not need to perform\n            any additional steps to use auto-tags. The following table lists the auto-tags that are automatically applied to messages you\n            send using SES. SES Auto-Tags Auto-tag name Description ses:caller-identity The IAM identity of the SES user who sent the email. ses:configuration-set The name of the Configuration Set associated with the email. ses:from-domain The domain of the \"From\" address. ses:outgoing-ip The IP address that SES used to send the email. ses:source-ip The IP address that the caller used to send the email. ses:source-tls-version The TLS protocol version the caller used to send the email. ses:outgoing-tls-version The TLS protocol version that SES used to send the\n                            email. Fine-grained feedback for email\n                campaigns The ses:feedback-id-< a or b > tag is an optional message tag that you\n            can think of as a hybrid or semi-automatic tagâwhile it's similar to the\n            auto-tags discussed in the previous section, the difference is that you must manually\n            add it and use the ses: prefix key. You can use up to two of these tags\n            defined as ses:feedback-id-a and ses:feedback-id-b . When you specify these tags, SES automatically appends them to the standard Feedback-ID header which is used in providing delivery statistics, such\n            as complaint and spam rates, as part of a feedback loop (FBL), see Feedback loops . The Feedback-ID header is comprised of the identifier, SESInternalID , used by SES for collecting complaint\n            information, and the static tag, AmazonSES , identifying SES\n            as the sending platform such as: FeedBackId:feedback-id-a:feedback-id-b:((SESInternalID):(AmazonSES)) These optional feedback ID tags are offered as a way for you to generate fine-grained\n            feedback, such as for messages you send as part of an email campaign. You can use ses:feedback-id-< a or b > by specifying it as a message tag in the EmailTags field of the SendEmail operation request as shown in the following\n            example: { \"FromEmailAddress\": \"noreply@example.com\",\n  \"Destination\": { \"ToAddresses\": [\n      \"customer@example.net\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"Content\": { \"Simple\": { \"Subject\": { \"Data\": \"Hello and welcome\"\n      },\n      \"Body\": { \"Text\": { \"Data\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\"\n        },\n        \"Html\": { \"Data\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"EmailTags\": [ { \"Name\": \"ses:feedback-id-a\",\n      \"Value\": \"new-members-campaign\"\n    }, { \"Name\": \"ses:feedback-id-b\",\n      \"Value\": \"football-campaign\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"ConfigurationSetName\": \"football-club\"\n} If sending in raw format, you would add ses:feedback-id-< a or b > as a message tag to the\n            SES-specific header X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS . The ses:feedback-id-< a or b > message tag can also be tracked in\n            Amazon CloudWatch by specifying it as a CloudWatch value source just like any other message tag, see Adding a CloudWatch\n                Event Destination (Additional charges apply, see Price per metric\n                    for CloudWatch .) How to use event publishing The following sections contain the information you need to set up and use SES\n            event publishing. Setting up event\n            publishing Working with event data Event publishing terminology The following list defines terms related to SES event publishing. Email sending event Information associated with the outcome of an email you submit to\n                        SES. Sending events include the following: Send â The send request was successful and Amazon SES \n            will attempt to deliver the message to the recipientâs mail server. (If account-level \n            or global suppression is being used, SES will still count it as a send, \n            but delivery is suppressed.) RenderingFailure â The email wasn't \n                sent because of a template rendering issue. This event type can\n                occur when template data is missing, or when there is a mismatch between\n                template parameters and data. (This event type only occurs \n                when you send email using the SendTemplatedEmail or SendBulkTemplatedEmail API operations.) Reject â Amazon SES accepted the email, but determined \n            that it contained a virus and didnât attempt to deliver it to the recipientâs mail server. Delivery â Amazon SES successfully delivered the\n                email to the recipient's mail server. Bounce â A hard bounce that the recipient's mail server\n            permanently rejected the email. ( Soft bounces are only\n            included when SES is no longer retrying to deliver the email.\n            Generally these soft bounces indicate a delivery failure, although in some\n            cases a soft bounce can be returned even when the mail reaches the recipient\n            inbox successfully. This typically occurs when the recipient sends an\n            out-of-office automatic reply. Learn more about soft bounces in this AWS\n            re:Post article .) Complaint â The email was successfully delivered \n            to the recipientâs mail server, but the recipient marked it as spam. DeliveryDelay â The email couldn't be delivered \n            to the recipientâs mail server because a temporary issue occurred. Delivery delays can \n            occur, for example, when the recipient's inbox is full, or when the receiving email \n            server experiences a transient issue. Subscription â The email was successfully delivered, but \n            the recipient updated the subscription preferences by clicking List-Unsubscribe in the email header or the Unsubscribe link in the footer. Open â The recipient received the message\n                and opened it in their email client. Click â The recipient clicked one or more\n                links in the email. Configuration set A set of rules that defines the destination that SES publishes\n                        email sending events to, and the types of email sending events that you want\n                        to publish. When you send an email that you want to use with event\n                        publishing, you specify the configuration set to associate with the\n                        email. Event destination An AWS service that you publish SES email sending events to. Each\n                        event destination that you set up belongs to one, and only one,\n                        configuration set. Message tag A name/value pair that you use to categorize an email for the purpose of\n                        event publishing. Examples are campaign/book and campaign/clothing . When you send an email, you\n                        either specify the message tag as a parameter to the API call or as an\n                        SES-specific email header. Auto-tag Message tags that are automatically included in event publishing reports.\n                        There is an auto-tag for the configuration set name, the domain of the\n                        \"From\" address, the caller's outgoing IP address, the SES outgoing IP\n                        address, and the IAM identity of the caller.
