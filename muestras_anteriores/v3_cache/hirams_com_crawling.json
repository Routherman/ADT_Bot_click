Hiram's Resort founder. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email SEBASTIAN – Tom Collins, one of the men who changed waterfront property forever in Sebastian, died unexpectedly Saturday. The resort, sandbar, and full-service marina has made Capt Hiram’s one of Florida’s most unique and beloved destinations. Collins, 69, built the property to honor the memory of Sergeant Hiram Collins, a brave World War II soldier and great-uncle, who was killed at Normandy Beach. The evolution of Capt Hiram’s as a waterfront resort and restaurant is a unique story. The property was purchased by Collins in 1986, who partnered with Martin Carter and Jimmy Hoffman, to open what was then known as Sebastian Inlet Marina. Since then it has grown from a small marina into the area’s largest waterfront resort, restaurant, and sandbar. Capt Hiram’s River Raw Bar opened in 1987 with just 28 seats and has expanded continuously over the years, now accommodating more than 500 guests. In the mid-1990s, the Sandbar was added, and that casual part of the operation has continuously expanded. Most recently they have added the Coral Bar, Scoops, Bimini Beach and the Grand Sand Bandstand. The marina has also evolved over the years, growing from a facility with 14 boat slips to today’s full-service marina, with 60 slips. Hotel rooms were the next logical step, originating in 1994 with the construction of four Captain’s Quarters rooms, located over the ship’s store. The success of these rooms led to the development of the Riverfront Building, which opened in March of 2004. In 2016, the resort built another new 16-unit, two-story building. Sebastian Daily would like to extend our condolences to Tom’s family and friends. FEATURED EVENTS To add your event, call 772-925-5221.

If you’ve never been upstairs at Captain Hiram’s, in the Tiffany room, you’re missing the boat (pun intended!) The panoramic view of the Indian River Lagoon, with the waters in their shimmery-best, is a beautiful sight, and bonus points for being able to enjoy it in the luxury of air conditioning on a sweltering July evening. Although wine pairing dinners at Hiram’s aren’t new per se, (they have a handful under their belt already), the news is they are settling in now on a quarterly schedule. The next one, by the way, will feature California Wines and will take place on Thursday, October 17th. At $75 per person all-inclusive, I believe it was an amazing value! Such a refreshing thing to be able to report, given this economy we all live in today. Here’s a peek at what we devoured! Welcome Course: Gerard Bertrand Cremant de Limoux Brut and Brie en Croute, topped with honey, dried cranberry, and pecans. I believe every good wine event begins with bubbles, nothing else says, “Welcome! Enjoy! Cheers!” quite like it. The creamy brie in the puff pastry was cleansed off of the palate nicely with the sharp acid in the bubbles. First Course: Bertrand Picpoul de Pinet and Salad Nicoise. In all my years hosting wine education and tasting events, I had never heard of the French varietal “Picpoul.” Obviously, this got my attention! Not only did I love it, it was the favorite of the night, not only for me, but most everyone else at our table of eight. I decided to purchase six of them to take home (sorry, not sorry!) This southern France varietal’s name translates to “stings the lip.” Although that didn’t actually happen, it’s name references the grape’s mouthwatering high acid. The salad was presented beautifully, with it’s chilled shrimp, boiled egg, potatoes and green beans in a light vinaigrette. Second Course: Foillard Beaujolais (100% Gamay) and Chicken Veronique. This light bodied red can be enjoyed on its own or with some very versatile pairings. The aromas of fresh cut violet, iris and peony flowers wrapped in cherry, raspberry, and plum (with subtle background notes of potting soil) are paired with a tarragon based cream sauce atop a tender chicken cutlet. Third Course: Lazaret Chateauneuf du Pape with Boeuf Bourguignon Beef Stew. This wine’s wide array of aromas and flavors are reminiscent of a Provencal marketplace, with a rich and round texture. Sipping on this alongside the comfort and homey nature of the stew was very satisfying. Tender beef, red wine sauce, carrot, mushroom, onion, and garlic… need I go on? Dessert Course: Hampton Water Rose’ with Vanilla Crème Brulée: All good things must come to an end, and I was happy to see one of my favorite go-to wines in the lineup. This wine is a collaboration between rocker Jon Bon Jovi, his son, and the same French winemaker mentioned above, Gerard Bertrand. A crisp, refreshing Rose’ is a hallmark of Summer, as is anything with whipped cream and berries, so the Vanilla Crème Brûlée was the perfect sendoff at the end of the evening.
