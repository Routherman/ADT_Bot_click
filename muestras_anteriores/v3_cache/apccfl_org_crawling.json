Settled in 1884, incorporated as a town in 1886 and later as a city in January of 1926, Avon Park is the oldest city in Highlands County, Florida, and named after Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Avon Park is home to the South Florida State College main campus. Main Street retains a WW2 vintage Americana ambiance rich in history of United States agriculture and citrus productivity, as well as, its love of baseball (Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees trained here in the early 1900’s and our local high school has won 8 state championships). Avon Park is also where “Brown and Serve” rolls were invented. Avon Park has a population of nearly 11,000 people and welcomes over 800 businesses (home-based and brick and mortar). Avon Park is located five miles from Sebring, Florida – and about 45 minutes south of Lake Wales, Florida, off US HWY 27. About an hour north of us on US HWY 27 is I-4 & US HWY 27, exchange at Davenport, Florida. The “Mile-Long Mall” in the heart of “The City of Charm”, was once occupied by many thriving boutiques, antiques/arts & crafts vendors, department and grocery stores. These businesses were frequented by decades of loyal and inspired consumers – many were stationed here living or working with the US Air Force Base that closed its public/ primary operations in 1992. Today, downtown is ripe for growth and revitalization. The Hotel Jacaranda, the Diving Girl, Little Italy and 18 East restaurants have become popular tourist and dining destinations. A block away on Main Street is Donaldson Park – located on the grounds of beautiful Lake Verona and its public park, tennis courts, beach, and newly constructed lunch pavilions. Are YOU a trusted builder seeking new clients by creating opportunities for homeowners? Are YOU interested in starting a NEW BUSINESS and helping to build stronger commerce in Avon Park and fill vacant buildings? Your ideas will be welcomed. Many developers and civic-minded individuals have already shown interest in creating additional museums, an art-walk with crafts, food and beverage vendors, specialty shops and business offices, a spa, a wellness and fitness center, health and organic foods & pharmacy, a water splash park or even a professional sports team! If YOU or someone you know is interested in starting a new business, then please contact the City of Avon Park for information on how to acquire a business license. Once you obtain a business license with the City of Avon Park ( https://www.avonpark.city/community/page/business-application-forms ) and file appropriate paperwork with SunBiz ( https://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/ ) to verify your business with the State of Florida, your enterprise is ready to become a member of the Avon Park Chamber of Commerce, a non-profit 501 (C) 6 membership business organization. Through fundraisers, community events, marketing efforts, monthly sponsorship networking luncheons, and access to employer/employee development training, programs offered through APCC memberships, can help coach you to grow your business and facilitate business opportunities with other APCC members, the City, County governments, and others as a network of friends and potential clients. Executive Summary The executive summary is often considered the most important section of a business plan. This section briefly tells your reader where your company is, where you want to take it, and why your business idea will be successful. If you are seeking financing, the executive summary is also your first opportunity to grab a potential investor’s interest. The executive summary should highlight the strengths of your overall plan and therefore be the last section you write. However, it usually appears first in your business plan document. Write a business plan Download Forms Occupational License Join the chamber What to Include in Your Executive Summary Below are several key points that your executive summary should include based on the stage of your business. If You Are an Established Business , be sure to include the following information: The Mission Statement – This explains what your business is all about. It should be several sentences to a paragraph. Company Information – Include a short statement that covers when your business was formed, the names of the founders and their roles, your number of employees, and your business location(s). Growth Highlights – Include examples of company growth, such as financial or market highlights. Graphs and charts can be helpful in this section. Your Products/Services — Briefly describe the products or services you provide. Financial Information – If you are seeking financing, include any information about your current bank and investors. Summarize future plans – Explain where you would like to take your business. With the exception of the mission statement, all of the information in the executive summary should be covered in a concise fashion and kept to one page. The executive summary is the first part of your business plan many people will see, so each word should count. If You Are a Startup or New Business If you are just starting a business, you won’t have as much information as an established company. Instead, focus on your experience and background as well as the decisions that led you to start this particular enterprise.  Demonstrate what you have done thorough market analysis. Include information about a need or gap in your target market, and how your particular solutions can fill it. Convince the reader that you can succeed in your target market, then address your future plans. About Us Located at 28 East Main Street, the Chamber is right in the heart of “The City of Charm”.

Twelve awards will be presented at the luau-themed banquet with students from Memorial Elementary School performing on steel pans. There are four new awards being presented including: Touch of Class, Veteran’s Advocate, Young Entrepreneur and Community Involvement. “We have individual awards, group awards and what I would like to call unique awards,” Executive Director of the Avon Park Chamber of Commerce Kamla Long said. The Touch of Class award is presented to an individual who has “elevated the standard and experience for consumers in Avon Park.” Long said that she felt folks drive through Avon Park, they see empty buildings and the recipient strives to be an exception to that. The Veteran’s Advocate award is dedicated to someone who spreads awareness of services for veterans and provides care for those veterans in need. The Community Involvement award is for an organization that has shown outstanding support for the community. “We have several businesses that participate in providing sponsorships and support for events for nonprofits for individual needs in the community,” Long said. “And this organization that we would like to give this award to, they show up every single time, every time you turn around, you see their name. Long said they had a number of young entrepreneurs that started businesses, and some stood out. The award is to showcase that there’s room for young entrepreneurs in Avon Park. “Come on out and if you’ve got an idea and a dream just come do it,” Long said. “It can be a success.” It is $55 per ticket to attend the banquet. Those interested in attending the banquet, visit apccfl.org . Call 863-453-3350 or email info@apccfl.org for more information. The Avon Park Chamber of Commerce is located at 28 E. Main St. Their hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. from Monday through Friday. They’re closed on the weekends.

Chambers of Commerce are membership driven organizations in support and promotion of your business relationships. Chambers create opportunities to network with people that have similar goals and concerns in serving Avon Park and the Highlands County region. As a noted member of our directory, on social media platforms and other event publications, members gain important visibility and brand strengthening. Google and other popular search engines recognize Chambers as reputable sites in key word searches and SEO (search engine optimization). Members are given business referrals and can sponsor events that assist them with their public relations efforts, visibility, branding and marketing efforts. APCC helps to promote a business’ voice with local, regional governments and business communities. As a member of your local US Chamber of Commerce you are: associated with a historical United States business organization. The Avon Park Chamber of Commerce was established in 1904 and is aligned with credibility and positive community visibility. Statistics show that when consumers know that a small business is a member of their local chamber of commerce, they are 44% more likely to think favorably of it and 63% more likely to purchase goods or services from that company. Together, we are the Chamber. We are ‘builders’ of the community. You create an environment for conversation and action. As an Investment Partner, your input and feedback to the Chamber will be integral in our planning to fulfill our vision and strategy for economic growth. We will provide proper recognition for your support in our community efforts as well as enlist your wisdom as part of our Educational and Leadership series. This level offers your business the opportunity to invest locally and ‘serve above self’. Your logo will be displayed at events, all promotional platforms and your organization will be recognized as a Chamber builder. Your organization would be eligible to apply for a Chamber board seat as one becomes vacant.
