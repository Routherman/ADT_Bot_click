Shrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home. Hurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”. Here at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer award-winning cocktails , like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time. Join us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off. Oh! And, we hope you’re not afraid of ghosts—cause we’ve got one. Rumor has it, our restaurant is haunted. She’s a heartbroken woman still pining for her lover who never returned from sea. Can you hear her crying? Stop by and you may feel her sadness or even hear her slam the bathroom door...!

Shrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home. Hurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”. Here at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer award-winning cocktails , like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time. Join us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off.

Shrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home. Hurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”. Here at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer award-winning cocktails , like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time. Join us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off. Oh! And, we hope you’re not afraid of ghosts—cause we’ve got one. Rumor has it, our restaurant is haunted. She’s a heartbroken woman still pining for her lover who never returned from sea. Can you hear her crying? Stop by and you may feel her sadness or even hear her slam the bathroom door...!

Shrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home. Hurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”. Here at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer award-winning cocktails , like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time. Join us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off. Oh! And, we hope you’re not afraid of ghosts—cause we’ve got one. Rumor has it, our restaurant is haunted. She’s a heartbroken woman still pining for her lover who never returned from sea. Can you hear her crying? Stop by and you may feel her sadness or even hear her slam the bathroom door...!

Shrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home. Hurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”. Here at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer award-winning cocktails , like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time. Join us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off. Oh! And, we hope you’re not afraid of ghosts—cause we’ve got one. Rumor has it, our restaurant is haunted. She’s a heartbroken woman still pining for her lover who never returned from sea. Can you hear her crying? Stop by and you may feel her sadness or even hear her slam the bathroom door...!

Knowing that the special would increase the wait time we arrived expecting the very long wait.  Unbeknownst to us, they do take reservations so if possible make a reservation to avoid a long wait.  They outside bar has beautiful water views, making our wait time bearable.  All of the food and drinks we ordered were very good.  Lots of fun, tropical mixed drinks for the 21+ crowd.  My husband and daughter had all you can eat crab legs.  The kitchen sent them out in clusters of 3 per person and you could request another batch from the server over and over until you were full.  I had shrimp and grits which was very delicious.  We also had crab dip as an appetizer (very good).  I wish I could remember the server's name because she was absolutely awesome!  Overall we really enjoyed our dinner here and will certainly go back if ever in St. Augustine again.

Chris Taylorsville 30 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles St. Augustine Getaway Sep 2022 • family We have visited St. Augustine several times, however had was not aware of this waterfront restaurant. Nice views overlooking the marina, nice breeze while dining out on the porch. Inside and outside dining available. A bar out on the deck. Tonight, Wednesday they had a local musician entertaining guest with songs and requests. He interacts with the patrons very well. Wait staff was courteous, friendly and helpful when we had questions about the menu or needed other items. This time of year it wasn’t very busy so there was no waiting. Food was great. Shrimp appetizer is amazing. Shrimp cocktail was almost a meal in itself.  My wife ordered steamed oysters and clam chowder soup. Our son ordered the shrimp seafood boil and it was more than he could eat, good portions. Recommend this location if your in the area for food and entertainment if it’s a night the musician is performing.

Jun 2023 • family Some in our group had done a chartered fishing boat that morning, and the charter company helped to clean the fish and put it in our cooler - they recommended coming by here to have the staff cook it. We called ahead and they took a reservation for our group of 18 and accepted our fish upon arrival. We didn't really know what to expect, but they cooked our fish three ways (fried, seared, blackened) and it was a hit! We really enjoyed getting to try our catch and have a few drinks. The restaurant itself was a little hot and they seemed to be out of a lot of sides, but that's the only complaint we had.

When the waitress finally came back to check on us we had muddled the our lobster stating to how it was just not ok. She did remove one from our bill but the other 2 were not offered even a substitute. Unfortunately we are done with the vibe.

At 7 pm they were out of oysters, disappointing! Our waitress did apologize many times for this shortcoming.\nLet me give a great review on the Tuna Poke Bowl. I made a change, instead of Teriyaki glaze, I asked for Key Lime and Rum glaze (they use on another dish). As we were drinking Rum Runners, so this blended perfectly. Tuna was perfectly cooked and was a nice portion.\nWe had told numerous people about ayce crab legs and now we have to recall the idea of meeting there.

Stephanie B 720 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles One of our favorite places to eat in St Augustine. Pet friendly covered patio. Mar 2024 • family Of course we went back again on this vacation to St Augustine. We really like their food. Definitely one of our favorite places for cocktails, appetizers, and/or dinner. Covered outdoor pet friendly patio. We go on sunny days, rainy days, cloudy days, chilly days, pretty much any day.  We went there twice on this vacation.\n\nJake was our server. He was very attentive, friendly, and quick with refills and drinks. The mussels and creamy crab stuffed oysters were a huge hit. The other specialty oysters were good but the crab stuffed ones blew the other ones away. If there was an option to just order those, we’d get them every time. \n\nThe hubby and nephew both really liked the shrimp and grits. The mahi over rice was great, and the pot roast was cooked very well, but needed some seasoning/flavor. Not sure what type of Caesar dressing they use for the salad but it’s excellent. The cocktails are always well made and they have a great beer selection. Read more Written March 28, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

UKR2AMR Florida 7 contributions 0 2 of 5 bubbles Bland boil but delious dip Dec 2023 • family We made reservations and after a \"short wait\" we were seated. The establishment was very crowded, we guess because it was a Friday night and also because of the holiday.\nWe were greeted by our server and we ordered two beers. When she returned with our beverages we ordered an appetizer, Hurricane Crab Dip and our entree, Shrimp Boil.\nThe Crab dip was delicious! We couldn't get enough of it. The shrimp boil on the other hand was mediocre at best. The Oysters were not opened and we were not given anything to open them with, very few muscles a few potatos, some sausage and plenty of shrimp. After dropping off our meal we never saw the waitress again. We had no where to put the shells, skin, etc. We were never asked about drink refills.\nWe understand that it was a busy night but the service was horrible. The boil was not as expected, it had NO FLAVOR. Compared to the dip it was bland. I would not recommend this establishment to any one. Maybe it is fine for just grabbing a drink but not for dinner. Our tip to the server reflected her service. Read more Written December 23, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Dinah W 2 contributions 0 1 of 5 bubbles Disappointed for the last time. Mar 2023 • couples No. Food is horrible. We ordered nachos with chicken. It arrived cold, chicken was dried hard on chips, not much taste at all. We each ordered a bowl of clam chowder. It arrived cold as well. If it had been hot, It would have been pretty good. We have been here several times. Today is our last visit. Don't waste your time out money unless you are just going to drink with friends.

Ben Anderson 6 contributions 0 1 of 5 bubbles This place continues to get worse each year.  This year was the last visit Oct 2022 • none This last visit was our last, and we used to love this restaurant and location.  This last visit, the waiter did not take off our charge for the shrimp appetizer as we had asked and given him the coupon.  We asked if they had fresh fruit as a side and they said yes!  The fresh fruit was a sealed Dole fruit container that you get from the store.   They were out of chips, so we could not get the appetizer we wanted, or even fish and chips.  The quality of food and employment here is not worth the trip.  If you want a good meal and good atmosphere go to Sunset Grille, Conch House, or Harrys!\n\nHurricane Pattys is past its prime.

Space Man 1 contribution 0 1 of 5 bubbles Portable potty restrooms!!!! Dec 2021 • couples Dinner was only fair with snow crab over cooked an cornered with melted butter. Ever tried to crack crab cover and slick with butter on the outside? You need a lot of napkins with only a few small ones provided. \nAfter eating I needed to use the mens room and WASH my hands. Unable to find, i asked an employee where it was located, was told it was outside, at the end of the ramp to the right. I went outside and found a long ramp to the right, poorly lit, no signs. At the end of the ramp across a gravel drive we’re 2  blur portable potties, one handicapped, no signs no light. Inside, no light, no running water, standard PP. \non the way back, I saw a trailer potty unit on a trailer. Could not tell what it was from the ramp because agai no signs no lights, yes it was dark and front doors were facing 90 degrees away from the ramp and about 30 feet from it.\nComplained to water, manager came over, I expressed my concerns about the restrooms, refused to pay the 18% up charge for our party of 9. Manager threw me out. Glad to say I have been thrown out of much better establishments. \nI am sure he does not care but this Coloradian won’t be back\nAsk to use the restroom before you eat!!!

Fish was like eating at Capt Ds  never offered a drink refill. Never checked on.  Took forever to pay our check.  As a local we have many options.

The food is disappointing.\n\nThe grilled mahi taco was extremely bland and cold.  I don’t know if they failed to season and heat it or if it’s always terrible.  There should have been some sauce and pr at minimum a piece of lime.  But there wasn’t.  \n\nTacos at home are cheaper and taste better.\n\nThis dish was served with multi-colored nachos, but no salsa, cheese or sauce of any kind.\n\nThe crab cakes were mediocre at best.  Minimal crab meat.  A nice remoulade sauce would have been much better than the jarred cocktail sauce it was served with.\n\nMy in-laws split a fish and chips meal which they liked.\n\nInside of the dining/bar area is not well maintained or clean.\n\nThe nicest thing about Hurricane Patty’s is the sign out in the main road.\n\nOk For frozen fried seafood/bar for the d and if you’re already hammered.  Probably ok for beers too, especially for the young college crowd.  But I wouldn’t go back.\n\nToo many other good choices locally to settle.

William G St. Augustine 652 contributions 1 2 of 5 bubbles Food was ok but service.... Dec 2021 • none Have you ever been to a restaurant where the waiter comes out and treats you great and starts your order and then.... the waitress / waiter comes out for the table next to you and starts to tell them about all the specials (which you never heard about)? That was the start of our visit...\n\nHave you ever placed your order (appetizers) and then waited a looong time, while the table behind you (yea - the one that knew the specials) - got the same appetizer a good 10 minutes before you? \n\nHave you ever gotten a cob salad - with no dressing after waiting a lot longer than the table behind you? So long you had to go and ask if they forgot?\n\nHas the waiter ever said he was sending the manager over, but the manager never showed?\n\nHave you ever had the waiter run after you when you left cash on the table cause you had enough and then he comes yelling across the parking lot \"HEY! Did you still want to talk to the manager?\" We just shook our heads and \"no need\".\n\nHave you ever had that same waiter return a minute later and hand you back most of your tip and say \"You don't need to leave this\"? \n\nWe didn't tip much, but we did tip. We realize the issues aren't all his problem.\n\nIn any case, the food (other than the salad) was all very tasty. The chicken tacos were very good. The Tuna Nachos were chips with some tasty tuna. The crab dip and the fried pickles were awesome. Read more Written December 5, 2021 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

FLtrotter St. Augustine 359 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Good local place, rustic setting Oct 2024 • couples We’ve been to HP several times and it’s mostly been good. This time I had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes and it was great, lots of flavor. I always get the Minorcan chowder and is the best I’ve had, I can taste the spicy datil peppers and there’s the right amount of sweet. There is sometimes a band going on and the marina setting is great. The restaurants not a fancy setup but feels right, a little taste of older FL.
