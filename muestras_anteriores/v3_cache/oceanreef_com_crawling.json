Done All , Member Stories Homecoming ORC | November 4, 2021 ACCOUNT CALENDAR AND EVENTS CLUB LIFE QUICK LINKS Homecoming by Terry Baxter Winston waddled off the plane and took in a deep breath of sea air. His tongue rolled out, his ears went up, and his tail wagged. Even Winston knew: Home! Fair Patricia thinks home is New Hampshire where we have lived for twenty-five years. Of course, she loves it and has nested. But we actually spend more time at Ocean Reef than New Hampshire, and, if home is where the heart is, then Ocean Reef is home for me. Every Ocean Reef Homecoming brings a flood of memories and an overload of welcome new sights to assimilate – friendly faces that I cant wait to see (both staff and Members), and construction projects that were only partly along when we departed in the spring, but now ready for their debut. Starved after a long day of travel and lugging baggage, and not sure what was open, we dashed off to the Burgee Bar. The menu was extensive, the servings were enormous, and the beer was cold. Island time settled in. The next morning we went to the beautifully renovated Ocean Room to catch Craig Horowitz’s last day as manager after twenty-seven years. We felt lucky to be there to wish him goodbye. Breakfast was delightful as always, and the new manager, Kieran, was capable and attentive. Chef Josh surprised us with a “dessert” of hot beignets, the irresistible sweet fritters topped with powdered sugar and made famous in New Orleans. I had never noticed they were hidden under the “sides” in a corner of the Ocean Room breakfast menu. I am afraid I will become a hopeless addict. The new Reef Lounge looked so inviting, we returned that evening. Everyone is an interior design expert, so opinions were exchanged on the décor. I immediately loved it. By 5:30 the room was packed to capacity. The new seats are comfortable for a leisurely cocktail and small plate or sushi, and I look forward to trying the cigar porch just outside. Chef Josh (who must live in the kitchen)(he also does Reef Eats) still serves my favorite (boom boom chicken) and has added a similar riff on shrimp that I can’t wait to try. Fair Patricia stuck with her reliable sliders, which Josh said were the best sellers. The evening was filled with a heart-warming parade of friends and renewed acquaintances. Home indeed. The next night I sat alone at the sushi bar at the Islander (Pat was still busy unpacking). I had another happy culinary delight. Chef Kareem has somehow made the lobster bisque even more velvety and delicious, and the old stand-by, Melanie’s Roll, will be another nice reminder of the Horowitz family’s legacy. The landscaping is gorgeous, familiar faces abound, and there is no snow in the forecast – a pretty good start for our first weekend.

Done All , Tennis and Games Making a Difference: Kevin Fish Ocean Reef Administrator | December 13, 2019 ACCOUNT CALENDAR AND EVENTS CLUB LIFE QUICK LINKS Making a Difference Kevin Fish By Gertrude Mann, Member Since 1974 One of the busiest places on The Reef these days is the Tennis & Games Center. Just pass by any morning. You’ll probably see golf carts, cars and scooters filling the parking spaces, and lots of activity inside on the courts. Tennis Committee Chairman Kevin Fish is enthusiastic about what’s going on with games and lessons for all. He talks about his job as newly appointed Chairman and why he and his wife Sandra can spend three hours every day happily playing tennis. He says, “Jimmy Morton and his staff are phenomenal. We’ve played at many tennis centers in our travels. None can compare with what we have here. I didn’t play a lot of tennis while growing up. My interests were football and baseball, but now tennis is both a passion and a pleasure. We took a lesson from Jimmy in 2013 and knew we’d found our new home. We rented for a while and then bought our house on Cinnamon Bark. We spend the season here but take our boat to Nantucket and Newport for sport fishing in the summer. I learned how to fish from my father, the late Edward Fish.” An early memory of Ocean Reef was of a boat trip to Key West with his father and little brother. Kevin remembers returning to the old Medical Center for an emergency with his brother’s finger, after which his father, a Club Member, bought a boat slip and a house. It was 1981. Kevin recalls an Ocean Reef with few of today’s facilities and amenities. He says, “The Burgee Bar was a hut with a few plastic chairs and a pinball machine. We came often from our home in Boston. I always loved Ocean Reef and admired the people who worked here.” Kevin’s goals as Chairman for tennis are to work closely with his dedicated committee to continue to serve the Members with an excellent program. He constantly talks to players, gets their ideas for new experiences, and conversely, wants to hear about what isn’t happening that might enhance the Tennis Center. Kevin credits Director Jim Morton for listening to all comments and implementing changes. He says the Morton Machine generates the energy and excitement of playing tennis at the Center. It is due to Jim’s dedication to the Members. “It’s all about the Members,” Kevin says. “We want to do the right thing for them.” Kevin reiterates the excellence of the Tennis Center staff. They include Jim Morton, Director of Tennis, Justin Romero, Head Tennis Pro, Alex Henderson, Assistant Pro, Bradley Mixson, Assistant Pro, Spencer Newman, Assistant Pro, Michael Balcom, Head Pickleball Pro, Maintenance Staff- Jesus Quinones, Supervisor, Jesus Gonzales, and Joel Perez, Tennis Pro Shop- Giselle Turner, Supervisor and Buyer, Anayeli Galindo, and Jennifer Martinez. A new tennis initiative of a Tournament between Associates and Members is open to all. This past October, there were 20 players in each category. Forty players enjoyed the fun of the game and the delicious lunch, sponsored and provided by Kevin Fish. Our Tennis Chairman sums up his role when he says, “Dedicated leadership surrounded by good people brings good results. Come and play with us. You’ll find a warm welcome at the Tennis & Games Center.” Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

Done All , Stories , Traditions 9 Frequently Asked Questions About the Ocean Reef Dress Code Ocean Reef Administrator | October 28, 2019 ACCOUNT CALENDAR AND EVENTS CLUB LIFE QUICK LINKS Dear Joan the Shopper – 1. Q. Collared Golf Shirts seem to be a uniform at Ocean Reef. I’m a 40-year-old man with a 13-year-old son, when and where must we wear collared shirts? A. The Ocean Room requires a collared shirt at all times. After 5 p.m. all other OR dining venues (with the exception of the Burgee Bar and the Raw Bar) expect you to arrive “collared”. Long pants or walking length shorts should also be part of your uniform. This goes for your son as well as you since all dress code rules apply to children over 12… Collared shirts (tucked in) are also required at the OR practice range and golf courses. 2. Q. I have no objection to jackets and ties, I’m just confused about where I should wear them? A. The CH Prime restaurant in the Golf Clubhouse requires a jacket in season (November until Memorial Day). Recently the rule has been modified so that during the summer months, only a collared shirt is required at CH Prime… Jackets are suggested for the Grand Seafood Buffet and other special dinners in The Ocean Room… There is no rule that says you must ever wear a tie, though I personally feel a tie or an ascot add a nice creative touch to a gentleman’s attire. 3. Q. I am a 58-year-old woman who, thanks to Pilates and our wonderful Fitness Trainers, favors a bikini for beachwear. I am confused by the Dress Code term “full-coverage” bathing suit, what exactly does that mean? A. The ORC Board has clarified that rule stating women may “wear one-or two-piece suits with appropriate coverage.” I think that means that your bikini tops should not be too revealing and the bottoms should not be too scant. Keep the forbidden thong in your bureau drawer and remember to wear your cover-up before lunching at Palm Court. 4. Q. I’m a guy who loves to jog at Ocean Reef and I never understood the rule in the Dress Code that says “shirts worn by gentlemen within the community must have sleeves.” A. You aren’t the only one to question that rule. Happily, it has now been changed to sleeveless shirts manufactured specifically for athletic activity (e.g. jogging, biking, working-out) can be worn in the general areas of the Club’s outdoor space. They are a “no no” in restaurants and at any other ORC indoor facility (with the exception of the Member Fitness Center and the Marina Fitness Center). 5. Q. I’ve seen a few young men here at The Reef for Spring Break and they are wearing those awful tank top undershirts. I hope Ocean Reef is banning those. A. An amendment to the Dress Code says that only tank tops manufactured for athletic activity can be worn at the pool, beach and Beach Grill areas of Buccaneer Island. And if you are caught wearing any style tank top after 5 p.m., the Dress Code Police will turn you into an Iguana. (Just kidding about the consequences but not about the rule.) 6. Q. What’s the latest official word on wearing jeans at the Ocean Reef Club? A. Nothing has changed. Only smart long denim jeans, no cut-offs, rips or tatters… (Grandmothers’ alert: be sure to tell your young granddaughters once again that their “short short short” shorts will not cut it at Ocean Reef.) 7. Q. My cell phone is my most important accessory, but I have heard that it can’t be used in any of the Club’s restaurants. Suppose I have an important call. A. If your cell rings and it is a call you feel you must take, leave your table, walk out of the dining area and answer your phone… Also please remember to treat the Fitness Center like a restaurant. Talking on your phone is also prohibited there. 8. Q. I just learned to play Pickleball. Any special OR policies about what to wear on the court? A. Unlike the Dress Code for Tennis, which specifies appropriate tennis clothing and footwear, you can play Pickleball in fitness attire and footwear. Swim trunks and non-tennis tee shirts are not allowed. Pretty much anything else goes – unless you are playing croquet (which always involves wearing white). 9. Q. I’m a relatively new Member and I just wondered what exactly is the purpose of having a Dress Code at Ocean Reef Club? A. I like that question, maybe because when we moved to The Reef in 1999, I failed to understand why there should be a rule about the length of my shorts or a requirement that my husband Arthur wear a jacket to the Seafood Buffet. Then a tennis friend, a longtime Member of OR, told me that I should be grateful for those restrictions. “You aren’t at a Caribbean resort,” she said. “Ocean Reef is a club and clubs have standards and rules. Part of your identity as a Member is that you follow them. A club without traditions is a resort.” … That answered my question. I hope it answers yours.

Done All , Stories US Flag Protocol for Ocean Reef Club Members Ocean Reef Administrator | October 28, 2019 ACCOUNT CALENDAR AND EVENTS CLUB LIFE QUICK LINKS Displaying the American Flag is a common, proud sight as Members travel about The Reef. Homes, business owners and clubs often erect flag poles and fly US Flags to provide their homes and our community with an obvious sense that “Here we honor our country.” With that noble objective comes a sacred responsibility to observe the protocol associated with that intention. It’s the protocol of saying, “Good Morning to you” and the smile that you render when someone says, “Good Morning” to you. Failure to return the greeting and smile is a snub. Failure to follow flag protocol is considered akin. If you fly the US Flag, you must lower it at sunset and raise it again at 8 o’clock in the morning – a solemn protocol called “Colors”. You must also raise your flag completely and return it to “half mast” in periods of national mourning. These periods can only be proclaimed by State Governors or the US President and are often violated by clubs and local organizations, with good intentions, when a popular leader or member dies. Luckily for late risers, you may elect to properly illuminate your flag at night and fly it night and day. Be especially attentive to potential noise that flag halyards can make in certain winds and wind speeds. The advent of synthetic fibers has vastly increased the life of well-made flags. However, none are totally resistant to weather and sunlight and eventually become frayed so as to become useless. When this happens, the US Flag must be replaced and the retired flag properly disposed of by burning. Burning is best done with the flag properly folded in a neat, clean cardboard box outdoors in a metal bucket or pail. You can use an ounce or two of charcoal lighter fluid to dampen the box and ignite it with a long gas match. Many use the moment as a solemn ritual, perhaps with family to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. “Flag Day” (June 14 th ) or “Independence Day” with family are days that usually work well and teach respect for our flag. The photograph shows the nautical flag mast near the Raw Bar that allows the display of the US Flag seemingly displayed incorrectly below the Ocean Reef Club famous blue burgee flying high above. Three nautical flag masts dominate the entrance channel into Ocean Reef Harbor and all three position the US Flag below either the Ocean Reef Club Burgee or the Ocean Reef Yacht Club Burgee at the yacht club’s Quarterdeck Room above the dockmasters office. This positioning is perfectly correct as the position of the US Flag at the top of the “gaff” angled yard is the position of greatest honor and mimics the aftermost position of all large national flags of all sailing vessels from the days of sailing warships when the immediate nationality of the vessel was paramount from long distances. Nautical flag masts have “spreaders” to each side that can contain useful information using burgees or alphabet letter flags. The spreader on the right or “starboard” is the side of greater honor. Thus we see the local US Coast Guard Flotilla flag on the right honoring its association with the USCG. The Club’s burgee at the top designates the owner of the mast – your Ocean Reef Club that is spelled out, flag-wise, on the first mast entering the harbor. The protocol and study of flags is called Vexillology. Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

About the Club How big is Ocean Reef? The land the Club occupies is approximately four miles long and a mile wide. This encompasses 2500 acres.

With a shopping village and all the conveniences of a big city wrapped in a small town atmosphere we have many Members that have decided to make this their home.

From local seafood and vegetables grown right down the road to internationally acclaimed chef wine dinners the array of dining options seems limitless. Getting There Does the Club have any debt?

Ocean Reef has a long tradition of excellence and value. The protection of these core values is evidenced throughout the community, facilities and services. Beyond some of the intangible assets lies the Members’ physical asset of their home. To preserve and enhance the Member’s assets, the Ocean Reef Club offers Vacation Rentals. For the Equity Member, while not in residence, participation in the vacation rental opportunity offers asset protection through the Club’s extensive resources while Social Members and Guests are provided the continued pleasure of experiencing the unique lifestyle afforded only through the Club’s world-class amenities and services. Vacation Rentals is Club owned, Club managed and is committed to providing Membership excellence in every aspect of the relationship. Every Vacation Rental residence has an on-premise, dedicated account specialist ensuring the attention to detail and guest experience is never compromised. Participating Equity Members appreciate the seamless billing, as warranted, through their Member account, flexible owner usage, bulk purchasing opportunities, on-site reservations, pre- and post- occupancy inspections, generous Owner Referral commissions and integration into the broad based, global Ocean Reef marketing plan. In-residence Members and Guests enjoy 24/7 support by the Front Desk and Bell Stand, full-service housekeeping, after hours Resident Manager and an on-site engineering team – all staffed by Club Associates. Your Club has established brand standards and no other team is more prepared to preserve these standards than your Ocean Reef Vacation Rentals’ team. Vacation Rental General Questions Are there any special benefits or advantages for those participating in the Ocean Reef Vacation Rentals’ program? Ocean Reef staffs an on-site Manager on Duty (MOD), 365 days a year to handle after hour emergencies as well as Guest and Owner concerns. Ocean Reef has experienced maintenance personnel on call daily and holidays to quickly resolve any concern and to ensure the highest level of Member service. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can I personalize my unit? While we are happy to make recommendations, we encourage you to make your residence ‘your own’. One of the interesting nuances of the Club’s collection is each residence is individually owned and, as such, offers a unique experience. We do, however, suggest the removal of sentimental décor items prior to opening your residence to a Member/Guest. If you would like to have these types of items when occupying your residence, please feel free to do so. Prior to your departure, simply store them in your owner’s closet for their safety and to avoid mishaps. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can I place restrictions on my rental unit? By default, all Ocean Reef residences are designated as non-smoking residences. To maximize your exposure, we encourage you to designate your residence as “Pet Friendly”. Knowing Ocean Reef is a pet friendly destination should come as no surprise. However, did you know many Ocean Reef Club Members pre-plan and seek pet friendly experiences? According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, a full 67% of American households have a little companion in their home. Certainly not all of these families travel with their pet, but this request is becoming more and more prevalent in the luxury travel markets. Were you aware that, unless you have instructed otherwise, your Ocean Reef residence is marketed as ‘No Pets’? If you are nodding your head, then you have automatically eliminated a substantial portion of the potential Member/Guest travelers from enjoying your residence. As demonstrated, pet owners may be willing to pay a little more for the pleasure of toting Rover along with them when they travel. One might also argue that the duration of the stay may be longer as the Member/Guest isn’t so concerned about returning home quickly to bail out their loved one from puppy ‘jail’. Indeed, damage to your residence by a pet may be a valid concern. Understanding our number one priority is to protect your asset; we have implemented and adhere to a very strict Pet Policy. To start, any Member/Guest bringing a pet into a Vacation Rentals’ residence is charged a pet fee. This is not a deposit but rather a fee so we may professionally clean the residence upon departure. Next, our Housekeeping Teams are in the residence daily and they are trained to identify any issues within the home. Finally, your property manager will preview the residence immediately upon Rover’s departure to ensure there is no damage inside the home. Naturally, any damage becomes the responsibility of the Member/Guest. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How can we control occupancy in our residence? Your Club carefully manages occupancy levels beginning with how we market a residence, to reservations, to check-in and while providing daily services. At any time, should we have a concern, we immediately address this with the Member/Guest. ORCA allows occupancy up to two per bedroom and two ‘at large’. Thus, a two-bedroom residence would customarily provide occupancy up to six. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can I rent my unit myself while on the Ocean Reef Rental Program? Due to the amount of effort and resources that goes into marketing and managing your residence, we ask for an exclusive arrangement. One of the exciting features of our program is the Referral Program. You may refer a fellow Member or Guest to the Club and, when they secure a reservation to enjoy your residence at the prevailing rental rates, you will enjoy a more generous portion of the rental fee. Vacation Rental General Questions Why Ocean Reef Club Vacation Rentals? A partnership with Ocean Reef Vacation Rentals means that you have chosen a quality experience, supported by the depth and breadth of the Club. This is what sets Ocean Reef apart from any other rental management company. We invest in the resources necessary to ensure the finest experiences. Ocean Reef Members and Guests have established service and quality expectations and no other team is prepared to meet and exceed these expectations. In addition, Members and Guests enjoying a Vacation Rentals’ residence receive exclusive benefits, while in residence, which increases the perceived value proposition. Your Vacation Rentals’ department is Club owned and managed. Thus, by working with the Club’s rental program, you are enhancing the value of your Club. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can I set my own rates for my unit? Ocean Reef employs two full-time Revenue professionals who monitor demand and occupancy and establish rates based on these factors and various trends in the luxury travel industry. Rest assured, these Associates understand the travel patterns of your fellow Members, Guests and Group travelers. The success of the effort is driven by offering dynamic rates and, more importantly, Member value. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Should we make our boat dockage available? Some residences certainly provide boat dockage. In some cases, such as a condominium, boat dockage is available, but ‘unassigned’. In short, this simply means the Member/Guest may have the ability to enjoy boat dockage but it is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and is not guaranteed. If boat dockage is desired, we encourage the Member/Guest to contact us for guidance. If the residence they are considering has unassigned boat dockage, we will provide the contact information for the neighborhood association’s dock master. For larger boats, Members/Guests may also work directly with the Ocean Reef Marina. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can I, or my contractors, gain access to my unit if I don’t have a reservation? Our policy is never to disturb a Guest or compromise their stay. Thus, we simply ask that you contact our office to ensure the residence is vacant. We recognize the desire to access your residence at various times to inspect it, change décor or retrieve items from your owner’s closet. We also understand the need for outside contractors or vendors to access the residence. To gain access to your Ocean Reef residence, simply call our office and, if vacant, we will provide a loaner key. Should your contractors or vendors need a significant amount of time in the residence, please contact us to schedule a maintenance block in order to accommodate the work needed. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How does Housekeeping work? While a Guest is in residence, we provide daily housekeeping (trash and tidy). The fee for this service is in the Club’s share of the rental revenue. The Guest may, for an additional fee, request full-service housekeeping, if they wish. When the Guest departs, your Housekeeping team provides a ‘departure clean’, which is a full-service effort and readies the residence for the next arrival. As well, the fee for this service is in the Club’s share of the rental fee. While a residence Owner is in residence, housekeeping services are only provided upon request, and for the appropriate fee. When the Owner departs, your Housekeeping team provides a departure clean and the fee for this service is conveniently billed to the Owner’s Member account. When an Owner has a non-paying Guest enjoying the residence housekeeping services are only provided upon request, and for the appropriate fee. When the Guest departs, your Housekeeping team provides a departure clean and the fee for this service is conveniently billed to the Owner’s Member account, or to the Guest’s credit card, whichever is indicated on the Guest Sponsorship Form. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How does Ocean Reef decide which units are rented first? When a Member/Guest is exploring options, your Lodging Reservations’ team will diligently work to fulfill specific requests (i.e.: residence size; location; pet friendly, interior features; view orientation; etc.). Often times, a Member/Guest will request a specific residence. Not surprising, if the Member/Guest previously had a wonderful experience, they will work to replicate this experience – starting with the same residence. The Reservations’ team is well versed with the subtle nuances of each residence including sleeping configurations and bathroom footprints. In some cases, we have the pleasure of personally previewing residences with a Member/Guest. As you can imagine, this truly helps ‘sell’ the residence. Consideration is also given as it relates to the Club’s standards. To ensure we exceed a Member’s/Guest’s expectations, we will first offer the stay in a Premium residence. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How is damage or theft in my unit handled (include damage waiver)? Ocean Reef has developed a very detailed housekeeping inspection process to protect your assets. After room attendants clean, trained “quality control” supervisors ensure cleaning standards are met and check for any damages. One of the growing business segments in the Vacation Rentals’ industry is Damage Waiver Insurance Policies. In short, the Guest is usually asked to pay a nominal fee, usually between $50 and $75 per reservation, to avoid being charged for lost or broken items while enjoying a residence. These policies historically carry a small deductible and provide a profit to the agency offering the coverage. Your Club explored this practice and elected not to implement such a program. This decision was unanimously agreed upon by the Club’s Executive Leadership. Our primary objectives remain the protection of your asset and enhancing the value of your Club. Here is how we intend to accomplish this: First, during the time a Member/Guest is enjoying your residence, the Club will pay for any lost or broken items. You will no longer be charged for the missing fork, broken coffee pot, and so on. Of course, the Member/Guest will remain responsible for any intentional or malicious damage and this service will not include issues considered normal wear and tear. Second, the cost for this service will not be seen in the Member/Guest folio. And, you will not receive a charge for this service in your Member Account Billing. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How much is the Management Fee and what does it include? The Club offers a fair and equitable rental environment for all Members. The standard relationship provides 60% of the rental fee to the residence Owner. There are some variances with this arrangement that can be personally discussed with the Vacation Rentals’ team. From the Club portion of the rental fee, they facilitate a comprehensive advertising and marketing effort. In addition, the Club employs a professional Lodging Reservations’ team who is fully-trained on how to ‘sell’ the Ocean Reef experience. Beyond these items, the Club offers Members and Guests the depth and breadth of the entire Club (i.e.: Housekeeping; Engineering; 24/7 Front Desk and Bell Stand; Concierge services…just to name a few of the services available). Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What happens if I want to enjoy my residence and there is a Member/Guest reservation in place? In some rare instances, we might be able to relocate the reservation. If we are not able to relocate the reservation, we must honor the Member/Guest reservation. Understanding we may secure Member/Guest reservations up to 12-months in advance, we encourage you to look forward, even beyond the 12-months’ window, and secure your Owner’s use dates. This will ensure you are able to enjoy your Ocean Reef residence during those special dates. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How often can I use my unit? As far as Ocean Reef is concerned, this is your residence and you should have the pleasure of enjoying it as you wish. The rental agreement does speak to minimum availability to be eligible for the Club’s program. Should these restrictions not match your desired usage, however, simply let us know so we can explore options. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How often do I receive rental checks? The Club operates on a calendar month fiscal period. At the end of each month, your Member Accounting team performs their audit, closes the month and rental checks and statements are disbursed usually the second week of the following month (i.e.: rentals during January are paid around the second week of February). Your statements will include each nightly rental revenue, the Engineering fee, any Housekeeping charges and any adjustment (i.e.: mechanical/appliance repairs, etc.). Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How much rental revenue can I expect? As you can imagine, we have the rental history for most neighborhoods and residence types. While we cannot guarantee rental revenues, we can provide historical data, which will give you an estimate of what you may expect. Rental revenues are always determined by economic factors beyond our control. In addition, how a residence Owner uses their residence (personal use and Guest use) will certainly impact their rental revenues. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How will my residence compare to the other residences in the program? Ocean Reef has established Standards, which help set expectations for Members and Guests. We use the terms ‘Premium’ and ‘Deluxe’. While some of the parameters are subjective, the guidelines are very precise and fair. Your residence will be evaluated based on these Standards. All residences will be treated and rented using the same parameters that apply to comparable residence types in our existing collection. Your residence will “compete” equally for Member and Guest rentals with like rated residences in our active inventory. For a complete explanation of the Standards, please give us a call. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How will the rental activity compare to activity experienced outside the Club’s program? Keeping in mind your Vacation Rentals’ department is Club owned and managed, it is safe to presume the majority of the Club’s rental activity will originate through your Lodging Reservations’ team. In addition, there are significant advantages for those Members working through their Club. First, the Member will enjoy a 10% discount, while in residence, on all Club managed food, beverage and retail outlets. Next, these members enjoy daily Housekeeping services, 24/7 Front Desk services and the full support of the Club’s Engineering team. While the other agencies do a fine job, none can provide the rental activity and support as realized with the Club’s program. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs If I need to take my residence out of the rental pool for renovations, what should I do? We congratulate you on your desire to make enhancements within your residence. So we may work around any pending reservations, please call us in advance of scheduling your work. Your Vacation Rentals’ team will then work with you and your contractors to provide keys to access your residence. When your enhancements are complete, we will coordinate any cleaning that may be required.  We will also schedule an updated professional photo shoot, if necessary. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What costs will I be responsible for as an Owner? Equity Members participating in the Club rental program will be responsible for normal wear and tear, furniture and appliance replacement, housekeeping fees for Owner’s stays (i.e.: departure clean), the annual Housekeeping Deep Clean service, the annual Engineering fee, non-routine maintenance, and interior upgrades including painting and upholstery cleaning. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What insurance, beyond what my association carries, do I need to participate in the rental program? Please review your policy with your insurance provider to ensure you are comfortable with your coverage. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What rates will be charged to rent my unit? Our proposed rate structure is determined annually each year. In order to achieve the highest occupancy percentages, average daily rates, and to secure the best overall rentals, a variety of pricing options are available to Members/Guests. Your Club employs two full-time Revenue Managers that monitors occupancy and demand. In addition, they watch trends in the luxury travel industry to ensure they anticipate needs and expectations. Ocean Reef will use its best pricing judgment in an effort to secure consistent levels of occupancy. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Who is my contact when I need assistance with issues relating to my unit? While you are certainly free to call on any of your Vacation Rentals’ team, we will designate an Associate to be your Member liaison. This Associate will become intimately familiar with your residence including the subtle nuances that make it special. This Associate will keep you informed of concerns related to your residence and will be responsible for managing your asset with the upmost care and diligence. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How can I access my unit? Ensuring security and privacy for our Members and Guests is paramount. If you wish to access your residence, please first contact the Vacation Rentals’ office to ensure the residence is vacant. Please keep in mind we often secure a last minute reservation. As a result, even if your residence did not have a reservation in place a few days ago, there may be a Member/Guest enjoying your residence today. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can a Member/Guest request an early check-in or late departure? By definition, check-in is after 4pm and check-out is before 11am. In the event a Member/Guest is requesting an early check-in or late check-out, defined as (check-in between 11am and 4pm; check-out between 11am and 6pm), the Member/Guest will be charged 50% of the daily rate for this convenience. In the event there is an arrival on the scheduled date of departure, the late departure request will be respectfully denied. And, should there be a Member/Guest departing that conflicts with the early check-in request, it is likely the request will be respectfully denied. Often times, a Member/Guest asks for access to a residence in advance of check-in so they may place some of their perishables in the fridge. While every effort is made to accommodate these requests, we must provide the Club’s teams (i.e.: Housekeeping, Vacation Rentals and Engineering) to facilitate their tasks before we are able to allow access to the residence. As a courtesy, the Bell Stand and Front Desk will assist in storing the perishables prior to check-in. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Can a Member/Guest enjoy access to the golf cart bay, garage or Owner’s golf cart? The short answer is likely no. The golf cart bay and garages are usually reserved for the Owner’s personal use only. Should a Member/Guest wish to enjoy a golf cart during their stay, we would introduce them to the Club’s Golf Cart Rental team for assistance. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Would it be of value if we included our personal golf cart with our residence? We suggest you keep your personal golf cart locked in a safe place while you are not in residence. Should a Member or Guest wish to enjoy a golf cart, while here at Ocean Reef, we will introduce them to the Club’s Golf Cart Rental department. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Should we provide the ability for the Member or Guest to charge their golf cart? This is a commonly asked question and we believe offering cart charging is a thoughtful feature. We recognize this is not always possible. Thus, if the Member or Guest is renting a golf cart from the Club, they are free to return the golf cart as often as they wish and exchange it for a fully charged golf cart. For the convenience of the Member or Guest, the Cart Rental team is also more than pleased to bring the fully charged golf cart to the residence they are enjoying and handle the exchange for them. In most cases, there is a small fee for this personalized service. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Is it recommended we heat our swimming pool? If so, what is the correct temperature? All swimming pools are required to be heated between December 1 and approximately April 15 (we allow the weather to dictate exact dates). The standard temperature is 85-degrees. While the Member/Guest, on occasion, may request the pool to be heated beyond this point, we discourage this as a higher temperature tends to strain the pool equipment. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Where does a Member/Guest pick up a key when they arrive? This is a common question and, while it seems to be a burden, we ask that all Members and Guests, to ensure the highest level of key integrity, pick up the residence key at the Front Desk. Knowing who is in residence is a very important safety/security initiative. The Front Desk is open 24/7 for the convenience of all Members and Guests. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How often does Housekeeping come and what duties do they perform? While enjoying a Vacation Rentals’ residence, Members and Guests appreciate the high level of Housekeeping services provided through the Club. This service includes daily housekeeping, which includes emptying the trash cans, removing the soiled towels and replacing with fresh towels and making the beds. Every fourth day, Members and Guests receive full-service housekeeping. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Are we required to allow a Member/Guest access to our residential elevator? We recommend you keep the elevator for your personal use only. There are special circumstances, however, when it makes perfect sense to permit access. Should a Member/Guest be traveling with an elderly or special needs’ family member, we feel it would be appropriate to allow access to the elevator. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs We purchased a few items for our Ocean Reef residence. May we ship them to Vacation Rentals? You are free to send your items to us at 35 Ocean Reef Drive, Suite 200, Key Largo, Florida 33037. If needed, we would be pleased to bring your items and place them in your residence prior to your arrival, or place them in your Owner’s closet. When shipping items, please inform us in advance so we are prepared for the delivery and include your name on the shipping label to ensure we place the items in the proper residence. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How are rental taxes handled? Members and Guest pay the prevailing tax rates above the daily rental rate. These taxes are held by Ocean Reef and disbursed, as instructed by the appropriate tax authorities, on behalf of the residence owner. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How may I secure Owner’s use reservations or alter a reservation that I already made? To ensure your request is handled promptly and accurately, we recommend you send your desired dates, or changes, to your Lodging Reservations’ team via their group e-mail address: Reservations@OceanReef.com . The Reservations’ office is staffed Monday through Friday from 8am to 7pm and from 8am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. For each individual reservation, you will receive an e-confirmation within 24-hours. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How will I know what my pending reservations are for my residence? You are free to call on us any time and we would be pleased to share this information with you. Please keep in mind that your fellow Members and Guests are rather active so the pending reservations are certainly subject to change. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Is it possible to have a long-term rental in my residence? By definition, we consider a long-term rental any reservation longer than 28-days. As a courtesy to you, the residence owner, we will tentatively accept the long-term reservation, pending your approval. We appreciate that many of our Members value use of their residence above the rental revenue. We remain committed to ensuring your satisfaction. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How does the Engineering Plan work and may I call to request a repair? Each Vacation Rentals’ is supported by the depth of the Club’s Engineering department. This is one of the most comprehensive, and economical, protection plans in the industry. In short, we become your first line of defense. Should any issues arise, we will immediately dispatch an Engineering Associate. Most issues can be quickly resolved. In the event, however, the issue be above our team’s skill set, we will engage the preferred vendor of your choice. This service is available while your residence is vacant or while you, your Guest or a rental Guest is enjoying your residence. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Does the Engineering Plan include installation of some interior items? One of the benefits our Members enjoy is complimentary installation of many commonly replaced items including light fixtures, plumbing fixtures and ceiling fans. In the event the requested work is outside the Engineering Plan, labor will be billed at a substantial discount off the standard fees. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Does the Club require specific kitchen and housewares inventory? As you know, the Club has established brand standards and we ask that each residence adhere to these standards. While you are not required to use a particular type of kitchen and housewares inventory, we will provide a summary of the items we ask that you consider offering in your residence. Your Club has thoughtfully assembled a comprehensive kitchen package inventory, which is available for you to purchase. This high quality package seamlessly transforms your kitchen to a comfortable and impressive presentation. The purchase of the package includes delivery, set-up and the removal of any of the old inventory you do not wish to retain. In addition, should we need to replace a missing or broken item, we carry surplus inventory and can respond quickly to bring your kitchen inventory to full complement. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Does the Club assist in other purchase? As you can imagine, the Club has great leverage and purchasing power. As a result of this strength, the Club offers bulk purchasing on items such as electronics, appliances and bedding. While there is seldom substantial savings when we purchase one item, we often facilitate ‘flash sales’, which provides impressive values to our Members. By working through the Club on purchases, in addition to the savings a Member may realize, they enjoy the convenience of the Club handling everything from the ordering, delivery, set-up and the removal of the old inventory, if warranted. Members also enjoy the pleasure of all purchases billed through their Member billing account. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs When I remodel, what should I do with my old furnishings? A member may dispose of their old furnishings in any manner they wish. If desired, we can facilitate the disposition to an agency of your choice, or we can simply contact a local source, such as Habitat for Humanity. Usually, these agencies provide a tax receipt for the Member’s personal use. If the Member is not concerned with the tax benefit, one option is to donate the asset to the Club. The Club disposes these furnishings in a variety of ways. The Club supports many charitable organizations and these furnishings help to support these organizations. On occasion, the Club will host Associate lotteries and allow the Associate to take possession of the furnishings for their personal use. Many Associates support family abroad and they ship these furnishings to their extended family. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs I am trying to sell my residence. May I still participate in the Club’s rental program? They say, ‘everything is for sale.’ By this philosophy, our entire collection of Ocean Reef residences is on the market. While we recognize this isn’t the case… we do recognize some of our Members are actively trying to sell their home or condominium. In the event you are considering selling your residence, please let us know. You are certainly welcome to participate in the Club’s rental program while you are attempting to market your residence. We will work in tandem with your real estate professional to ensure we remain a trusted resource and will work to be certain your residence is always looking its best. Please keep in mind that it is important to disclose to the buyer that you are working with the Club so they know there may be some pending reservations, which we may not have the ability to relocate. Disclosing this information will assist in a seamless closing, without compromising the integrity of the Club. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs I have a caretaker for my home. May I retain this person or will I need to release them when I enter the Club’s rental program? While many Members rely on the Club’s Vacation Rentals’ team to be their property managers, some continue to employ a caretaker for their residence. We respect these relationships and are proud to share that we have worked with most of the professional real estate caretakers here at Ocean Reef. Whether it is something as simple as coordinating professional furniture cleaning or a comprehensive residence enhancement, the end goal is to protect the Member’s asset and enhance the value of the Club. The Member’s trust in both the caretaker and the Vacation Rentals’ team is supported by open and transparent communications between all involved. If you currently employ a caretaker please let us know what responsibilities your caretaker will assume so we may work to exceed your expectations. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How will you intend to ‘market’ our Ocean Reef residence? We are often asked this question. Vacation Rentals is Club owned and managed. Thus, you enjoy the depth and breadth of the Club’s global advertising and marketing Plan. This alone is enough to drive the highest levels of desired occupancy and a very respectable daily rate at the Reef. However, generating interest is only the beginning. Your Vacation Rentals’ team is determined to showcase your Ocean Reef home in the best possible way. We are pleased to share that we enjoy an alliance with the foremost, industry provider of on-line visual marketing services. In addition to world-class photography, this partnership will provide interactive floor plans and video of each new residence. As a Member or Guest is considering their accommodations’ options, they will be engaged in a cutting-edge, user-friendly experience. Not surprising, some Members and Guests prefer to personally preview residences before they select. Your Vacation Rentals’ team is well prepared for this opportunity and are often in the field showcasing our collection one residence at a time. Rest assured, we work hard to showcase the subtle nuances and special features of each residence. In closing, we diligently work to be completely transparent with our marketing. As a result, whenever there are changes in a residence (furnishings or décor), we engage a professional photographer to capture the new features. After all, we want to exceed the expectations of each and every valued Member and Guest. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs Why do you require that participating Members allow up to three complimentary nights in my residence to promote the Club? In some instances, we are provided an opportunity to showcase the Club, and more specifically, the Vacation Rentals’ program. This opportunity may originate from a large group or a VIP. While we traditionally provide lodging at the Inn, we are occasionally able to convince the planner to consider a Vacation Rentals’ residence. This often translates into future measurable values at very respectable rental rates. Rest assured, we would never compromise the trust you have placed in your Club’s rental program. We will surgically evaluate these opportunities and only extend this gift when we determine the long-range net return to you and the Club warrants the courtesy stay. It is important to share that these complimentary nights do not accumulate, or roll over. Each fiscal year begins anew. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What is meant by ‘luxury linens’? Our goal is to align the standards within the Vacation Rentals’ program to that of the Inn. Should your Lodging Leadership staff elect to elevate the linens used in the Inn rooms in an effort to elevate Member/Guest experiences, it would be our intent to replicate their decision. At this time, the Inn is not considering using luxury linens. In the event, however, this situation changes, the Club may ask each participating Member to absorb a small portion of this linen fee. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs May I cancel the rental agreement whenever I wish? The rental agreement automatically renews August 1 of each year. If you wish to not continue with your Club’s rental program, you simply need to send us a short note, at least 30-days prior to August 1, indicating your desire to pull your residence from the program. Please keep in mind that there may be some pending reservations, which we may not have the ability to relocate. We will ask that you honor these pending reservations. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What is Travel Agent commission? There are two areas here: real estate and travel agent commissions. It is rare to see much travel agent activity in the vacation rentals’ environment but your Club does work hard to nurture the relationships we have with the area real estate professionals. The end goal is for the agents to refer their Member clients to the Club for their visits. When they do, we provide a commission to the agent, which reduces the gross rental revenue (prior to the shared arrangement). We offer between 10- and 15%-commission on the rental (not to exceed the first 14-days). Vacation Rental Owner FAQs I was told there are new ORCA rental rules. What exactly does this mean? In an attempt to build brand integrity within the Club, ORCA is asking Members to adhere to strict regulations as it relates to rentals. While some of the language is simply common sense (i.e.: noise, parking, etc.) there are some changes that directly impact the residence owner. We believe the most important point to consider is, whenever a residence owner is involved in a rental relationship, they must designate a rental manager who must be available 24/7 should there be any issues with the Member/Guest or within the residence. In the case of your Club’s Vacation Rentals’ program, we are pleased to share that your Club’s team is available 24/7, 365 days a year, which ensures any concerns are swiftly addressed. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs I was asked to put bed encasements on my beds. Why is this? This is simply a proactive step to ensure we keep pests out of the Club. You should take comfort in knowing that we currently do not have bed bugs and, by the thoughtful use of bed protectors, we can continue to stand proud. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs How will we know what other Members/Guests think of our residence? Ocean Reef Club has been built on traditions of excellence. Further to this point is the Club’s commitment to exceeding each Member and Guest’s expectations. For this reason, the Club solicits feedback from all our Guests on their visit. The survey is extremely comprehensive and covers every aspect of the Club experience including the processing of the reservation, arrival experience, food and beverage venues, recreation, retail and so much more. The in-residence portion of the survey explores the Member/Guest experience with lighting, technology, kitchen inventory, furniture, comfort and housekeeping. We thoughtfully peruse every survey and use this feedback to better understand how we can elevate the Member/Guest experiences. Should the information we learn be of value to you, as the residence owner, we immediately share this with you so we may work together to achieve higher levels of satisfaction. Vacation Rental Owner FAQs What is the $25 daily fee a Member and Guest is asked to pay? The daily service charge is $15 for one-bedroom residences and $25 for residences two-bedrooms and larger. This daily fee is often confused with a housekeeping fee. However, this is a Club fee that is received and disbursed to the Club’s hourly Associates, as outlined in the Club’s Human Resources compensation plan. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Are residences personalized? One of the interesting nuances of the Club’s collection is each residence is individually owned and, as such, offers a unique experience. We do, however, suggest the residence owner remove sentimental décor items. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Are there restrictions on residences? By default, all Ocean Reef residences are designated as non-smoking residences. Some residences are designated as “Pet Friendly”. Understanding our number one priority is to protect the Ocean Reef assets; we have implemented and adhere to a very strict Pet Policy. To start, any Member/Guest bringing a pet into a Vacation Rentals’ residence is charged a pet fee. This is not a deposit but rather a fee so we may professionally clean the residence upon departure. Next, our Housekeeping teams are in the residence daily and they are trained to identify any issues within the home. Finally, a property manager will preview the residence immediately upon Rover’s departure to ensure there is no damage inside the home. Naturally, any damage becomes the responsibility of the Member/Guest. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs How is occupancy in residences determined? Your Club carefully manages occupancy levels beginning with how we market a residence, to reservations, to check-in and while providing daily services. At any time, should we have a concern, we immediately address this with the Member/Guest. ORCA allows occupancy up to two per bedroom and two ‘at large’. Thus, a two-bedroom residence would customarily provide occupancy up to six. And yes, children are people too so they are included when we consider maximum occupancy. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs How are rental rates determined? Ocean Reef employs two full-time Revenue professionals who monitor demand and occupancy and establish rates based on these factors and various trends in the luxury travel industry. Rest assured, these Associates understand the travel patterns of your fellow Members, Guests and Group travelers. The success of the effort is driven by offering dynamic rates and, more importantly, Member value. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Is boat dockage available? Some residences certainly provide boat dockage. In some cases, such as a condominium, boat dockage is available, but ‘unassigned’. In short, this simply means the Member/Guest may have the ability to enjoy boat dockage but it is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and is not guaranteed. If boat dockage is desired, we encourage you to contact us for guidance. If the residence you are considering has unassigned boat dockage, we will provide the contact information for the neighborhood association’s dock master. Unauthorized vessels will need to be immediately relocated. For larger boats, Members/Guests may also work directly with the Ocean Reef Marina. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Can a Member/Guest request an early check-in or late departure? By definition, check-in is after 4pm and check-out is before 11am. In the event a Member/Guest is requesting an early check-in or late check-out, defined as (check-in between 11am and 4pm; check-out between 11am and 6pm), the Member/Guest will be charged 50% of the daily rate for this convenience. In the event there is an arrival on the scheduled date of departure, the late departure request will be respectfully denied. And, should there be a Member/Guest departing that conflicts with the early check-in request, it is likely the request will be respectfully denied. Often times, a Member/Guest asks for access to a residence in advance of check-in so they may place some of their perishables in the fridge. While every effort is made to accommodate these requests, we must provide the Club’s teams (i.e.: Housekeeping, Vacation Rentals and Engineering) to facilitate their tasks before we are able to allow access to the residence. As a courtesy, the Bell Stand and Front Desk will assist in storing the perishables prior to check-in. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Can a Member/Guest enjoy access to the golf cart bay, garage or Owner’s golf cart? The short answer is likely no. The golf cart bay and garages are usually reserved for the Owner’s personal use only. Should a Member/Guest wish to enjoy a golf cart during their stay, we would introduce them to the Club’s Golf Cart Rental team for assistance. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Is golf cart charging available? This is a commonly asked question and we believe offering cart charging is a thoughtful feature. Please understand, however, this is not always possible. Thus, if the Member or Guest is renting a golf cart from the Club, they are free to return the golf cart as often as they wish and exchange it for a fully charged golf cart.

In most cases, there is a small fee for this personalized service. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Are swimming pools heated? If so, what is the correct temperature? All swimming pools are heated between December 1 and approximately April 15 (we allow the weather to dictate exact dates). The standard temperature is 85-degrees. While the Member/Guest, on occasion, may request the pool to be heated beyond this point, we may decline this request as a higher temperature tends to strain the pool equipment. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Where does a Member/Guest pick up a key when they arrive? We ask that all Members and Guests, to ensure the highest level of key integrity, pick up the residence key at the Front Desk. Knowing who is in residence is a very important safety/security initiative. The Front Desk is open 24/7 for the convenience of all Members and Guests. Upon departure, all keys should be returned to the Front Desk. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Will we have access to the residential elevator? In most cases, the residential elevator will not be available for use. There are special circumstances when it makes perfect sense to permit access. Should a Member/Guest be traveling with an elderly or special needs’ family member, please contact us so we may explore the elevator usage together. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs We like to travel with special kitchen items. May we ship them to Vacation Rentals in advance of our arrival? You are free to send your items to us at 35 Ocean Reef Drive, Suite 200, Key Largo, Florida 33037. If needed, we would be pleased to bring your items and place them in your residence prior to your arrival. When shipping items, please inform us in advance so we are prepared for the delivery and include your name on the shipping label to ensure we place the items in the proper residence. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs How are rental taxes handled? Members and Guest pay the prevailing tax rates above the daily rental rate. These taxes are held by Ocean Reef and disbursed, as instructed by the appropriate tax authorities. Vacation Rental Guest FAQs Is it possible to enjoy a long-term rental in a residence?

We appreciate that many of our Members value use of their residence above the rental revenue.

Done All , Dining , Food and Beverage The Burgee Bar Team ORC | March 25, 2020 ACCOUNT CALENDAR AND EVENTS CLUB LIFE QUICK LINKS The Burgee Bar Team by Jody Steele Both Cody Evesque, Chef de Cuisine, and Sergey Berkebile, Sous Chef of the Burgee Bar, arrived at Ocean Reef Club about seven years ago. They definitely have found their home at the Burgee Bar. Their enthusiasm for their capable team and the camaraderie they have established has helped to make Burgee Bar the place to be. Chef Cody hails from South Carolina where he started working in food service at age 14, moved on to restaurant and kitchen management, and after honing his skills in a variety of types of cuisine, he came to The Reef. He is proud to share that his staff makes almost everything served at the Burgee Bar, except desserts. Almost two years ago, Chef Cody expanded the “kitchen” by adding an outdoor smoker for brisket, ribs, chicken and a huge favorite – prime rib on Tuesdays. As our new restaurant take-out process becomes part of our routine, Chef Cody will keep the popular smoker working to provide BBQ ribs, pulled pork, and prime rib for your dining pleasure. Sergey first came to The Reef as part of his internship in culinary school. He grew up working in the family restaurant in Pittsburgh. Smitten with Ocean Reef, he returned after graduation to stay. He shared that the team at the Burgee Bar is another family for him. What should I order… The menu at the Burgee changes about three times a year based on feedback from diners and the ingenuity of the chefs. Chef Cody calls it a mix of Southern style cooking, BBQ, and Asian Fusion. Next season, you will see the return of fish and chips, a new small filet, and amazingly, a cauliflower steak. Of course, the BBQ menu continues to tantalize us all with specials nightly and delicious Burgee sauces. Earlier this week the Burgee team, along with the entire Food & Beverage department, had to make a major adjustment to their operation and modify menus for the new take-out and delivery service. Cody and his team pared the menu down slightly but assure me Member favorites remain. This energetic team has a huge work ethic and creative spirit that really works. Although they won’t be able to come out and greet you at the tables for a little while, try the curbside pick-up or delivery, they are working hard behind the scenes in our new, but temporary, ORC world.

Done All , Club News , Food and Beverage Dreams Come True at Port O’Call ORC | November 20, 2020 ACCOUNT CALENDAR AND EVENTS CLUB LIFE QUICK LINKS Dreams Come True at Port O’Call by Micah Winecoff, Port O’Call Manager It’s hard to believe it was 2014 when Beverage Director Sean Carroll trained me to take the helm of Port O’Call. At that time, a wine and spirits shop with a wine bar was simply a concept. As the shop became busier over the years and we appropriated Wyatt Hosmer from the Recreation Department to join the team, the three of us continued to daydream about expanding from the 200 square feet space that we occupied. I don’t think we’ll ever forget the day Club President Alex Tonarelli told us a larger space in the Fishing Village could become available. We were speechless as we realized our dreams of expanding the shop were coming true. After what has been a unique summer for us all, it is with great pleasure that we introduce your new and improved Port O’Call Wine & Spirits, located in the former Leggiadro space overlooking the Marina. First & Foremost With the expansion, Port O’Call remains first and foremost a retail wine and spirits shop. Over the past 6 years I’ve loved learning your preferences and providing necessary variety, ensuring your house is well stocked with great wines for yourselves and your parties (although these days they’re more socially-distanced gatherings). Now we have more space available to stock a wider selection of wines. As always, we keep our wine prices extremely competitive and offer delivery services on all case orders. Your convenience is our goal so feel free to stop by to talk shop or call in and email your orders (305-367-5999; poc@oceanreef.com ). Expanded Offerings & Team In addition to the expanded retail offerings, we now have a beautiful new bar where we serve wines by the glass, including 16 high-end selections and a variety of other great values. Additionally, there are 4 beers on tap that will rotate various microbrews throughout the season. Most of the beers will be locally sourced as Florida has a plethora of great breweries. Our Culinary Team has curated a cheese and charcuterie board to pair with your favorite wines by the glass or cold beer as well. To enhance outdoor seating availability, the Port O’Call Patio features new lounge-style furniture and seating has been added under the covered deck near the shop. This is the perfect spot to sit, relax and imbibe in a premium beverage of choice while overlooking the beautiful Marina. We have also brought in some new faces to Port O’Call that may be familiar to you. Darren Daniels, who worked last season at the Burgee Bar, and Todd Mincemoyer, who you may recognize from Clubhouse Prime, are joining our team this year. With the additional staff, we’re able to expand our hours of operation to 11 a.m. – 8 p.m. seven days a week. Safety Reminders When visiting the shop, we ask that you please wear your mask and maintain proper social distancing to ensure the safety of yourself and your fellow Members. At this time, bar seating is limited and gathering in groups will not be permitted. We are only able to provide service while you are seated at the bar or one of our many outdoor tables. As safety is our number one priority, all tastings are postponed until further notice. For many of you and certainly for our team, Port O’Call’s expansion has been a long time coming. We are poised and eager to wow you with our new options. Please stop by and see us anytime as we relish the opportunity to introduce you to our new store. Cheers from Port O’Call!
