Those who withstand the ebbs and flows of staffing changes, rotating menu items, and evolving landscapes are a testament to the perseverance and resilience that only a select few embody. And behind every renowned restaurant lies a few essential elements that catapult it to iconic status. Consistency is at the forefront, and a few signature menu items will ensure folks return again and again. Throw in a unique customer experience and a robust behind-the-scenes operation that readily adapts to changes, and you’ve got all the makings for something exceptional. In short, you’ve got The Boathouse Oyster Bar , an iconic Destin hotspot that resonates far beyond its physical presence on the Destin harbor. Humble Beginnings at The Boathouse Founded in 1986, “The Boathouse” in Destin started as a small, unassuming bait shack on the harbor. Nestled amidst tiny cottages and a few bars, many of which began as former residences, The Boathouse quickly became a focal point for anglers eager to snag pompano, grouper, cobia, tuna, and dozens of other species inhabiting the local waterways. In those days, fishermen backed up to The Boathouse dock, and employees scooped bait into their boats. They would then head out for a long day of fishing in the shallow coastal waters, nearshore reefs, and the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Those who were successful would sell their catch and return the next day, hoping for another fruitful day on the water. If The Boathouse owners weren’t around, fishermen would grab their own bait, maybe a six-pack or two, scribble their name on a couple of dollars, and staple them to the wall for reimbursement. It was an honor system built on trust, reflecting the tight-knit, trustworthy fishing community that characterized those early days on the harbor. This simple yet honorable tradition embodied the camaraderie among anglers and community members living off the water, showcasing mutual respect for this small fishing village that was, and remains, the heart of Destin’s maritime culture. Destin’s Evolution and The Boathouse Legacy Businesses have come and gone through the years, the weather has altered the landscape, and infrastructure changes have reshaped the community. No more a sleepy fishing village, Destin has grown exponentially through increased tourism and a thriving fishing industry, now hosting several world-class fishing tournaments and boasting the largest charter fishing fleet in Florida. Swelling each summer as tens of thousands descend on its sandy shores for sun-soaked days and boundless outdoor adventures, Destin becomes a hub of activity. With the completion of the Destin Boardwalk in 2012, Harborwalk Village, as it’s known today, is busy year-round, with shops, water sports, and family-friendly restaurants and activities luring visitors to the Destin harbor each season. Through it all, The Boathouse has remained steadfast, weathering the test of time and evolving into one of Destin’s favorite hangouts alongside the community it proudly serves. Current owners, Missy and Chris Schofield, continue to serve ice-cold beer, fresh oysters, and incredible views, just as they did when they bought this family-friendly restaurant back in 2018. And fishermen still share tall tales with fellow patrons each evening while listening to live music and watching the sun sink into the harbor at day’s end. The Destin Boathouse Menu From the catch of the day to simple yet tasty dishes, The Boathouse consistently offers food that resonates with its customers. You’ll find nothing pretentious here, just good eats in a cozy spot that feels like home with a view. Missy started working at The Boathouse in 1998, serving stints as both bartender and line cook, and her philosophy of preparing scratch-made food still resonates today. “We started by putting dishes together with only fresh ingredients we could utilize in more than one way,” says Schofield. You’ll find the flat iron steak on melt-in-your-mouth sandwiches and tacos, while the smoked tuna dip is available as an appetizer, a refreshing salad, and served open-faced on an onion roll. Crafting each tasty morsel from high-quality ingredients means every bite is fresh, flavorful, and authentic. Popular items include hand-pattied hamburgers, prime rib sandwiches, and cajun-style hot-boiled peanuts, washed down with a Boathouse Breeze or what Missy calls their “house wine,” a Busch Light . But the gumbo, available for takeout in sizes from pints to gallons, and the oysters, served raw, steamed, baked, and chargrilled, continue as mainstays, consistently landing them on “Best Oysters and Gumbo” lists for the past 30 years. Entertainment and Events at The Boathouse in Destin At The Boathouse, it’s not just about serving tasty seafood; it’s about having fun, listening to live music nightly, and giving back to the community. Many signature events help raise money for local charities, including Road Dogg Rescue, Food for Thought, and Children in Crisis. The Boathouse offers a  lineup of Slacker events geared towards embracing life’s lighter side. Locals on the Harbor occurs the first Friday of every month, encouraging visitors and locals to come out, enjoy a free beer, and spend some time on the harbor. The Slacker 0.5K offers a little amusement regarding fitness, featuring light-hearted challenges like donut hole eating and oyster shooting. June brings the Forrest 5K Run/Walk and Kid’s Fishing Day, treating 50 kids to swag, lunch, and six hours of fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Whether dressing in costume for the annual Turkey Trot and Dock the Halls or participating in the many fishing tournaments The Boathouse hosts and sponsors, it’s all about bringing folks together, having a blast, and making a difference in the community—all while soaking up those sweet Destin vibes by the water. Visit The Boathouse in Destin on Your Next Trip As new chapters unfold, this family-friendly restaurant remains a local joint, offering delicious seafood, breathtaking views, and a relaxing time for all. They’re open seven days a week, and you’ll probably see the same staff each time you visit, as most have worked here for years. With room for about 100 patrons, you’ll no doubt make a new friend, whether at a table, watching a game on one of over a dozen TVs, or outside on the dock.  And you can guarantee dollar bills will still be hanging, hundreds of them now, charming reminders of visitors commemorating special events at The Boathouse, including birthdays, anniversaries, or a first (or tenth) trip to Destin. If you’re looking for a  place to kick back, savor fresh seafood, and soak up laid-back vibes by the water, try The Boathouse. More than a destination, it’s an experience and a must-see on your next trip to Destin !

But did you know about the exciting and lively entertainment that awaits once the sun goes down? After enjoying any of our outdoor water activities here at Crab Island Watersports , we recommend you continue to explore and treat yourself come the end of the day. As with this beauty of a beach, you’ll be amazed at the effervescence of Fort Walton Beach at night time. Whether you want a chill evening in a cool bar sipping on a signature cocktail at the beach front or if you’re seeking something more lively, there is no shortage of pubs, clubs and bars, dancing, live music and even games for those who continue to seek stimulation late at night. Looking for something more substantial than just a drink? Fear not, there are many incredible restaurants in and around the Fort Walton Beach area, including the amazing Broadwalk on Miracle Strip Parkway on Okaloosa Island. With many bars and restaurants serving fresh seafood and a great many other types of food that you can choose from. Now, because there are simply too many  incredible places on this wondrous island, it’s unlikely that you will have the chance to experience them all (this upsets us too, but it’s true), that is if you’re only here for a limited time on vacation. This is why we have taken it upon ourselves to narrow down our list to just a few of the very best places to spend a fun night on your visit to Okaloosa Island. Boathouse Oyster Bar Visit their website (opens in a new tab) This Okaloosa Island oyster bar is considered a hidden gem, and the locals quite literally try to keep this place a secret. Boathouse Oyster Bar has had its spot on the Destin Harbor for over 30 years, serving the freshest oysters, cold beer and entertaining their loyal customers with live music every day of the week. Their oysters and gumbo have been voted the best, however, their menu is not limited to only those fresh sea delicacies. At this Boathouse bar you can also get your hands on some delicious burgers, sandwiches, salads and other warm hearty meals whether you prefer seafood, meat or none of the above. The daily live music, usually commencing from 6:30PM onwards, consists of local bands with original styles and songs. Some weekends hold special music events in store with bigger shows and well known artists. Rumor has it this place had a famous visit once from modern country music icon Keith Urban as well as other well known musicians. Here’s an extra piece of information, this bar has dollar bills, bras and hats hanging from the ceiling. Not only hanging from the ceiling, the ceiling is in fact made up of those objects. This is based on a trend going around in Florida beach bars that indicates, the bars with this theme of decoration are usually the most fun and lively bars. This place is a must! Be it for the delicious fresh (and best) oysters, the original  live music or cheeky decor trend…you’ll regret not going. Their business hours? From 11 till Late! Location : 288 Harbor Blvd, Destin, FL 32541 Contact : (850) 837-3645 Al’s Beach Club and Burger Bar Visit their website (opens in a new tab) This is the place that keeps on giving. Al’s Beach Club and Burger Bar have really set the bar high. Whether you’re looking for somewhere to enjoy with family, friends or your partner, there is A LOT of entertainment to be had at this ideal location at the beachfront within Okaloosa Island Boardwalk. From live music, fireworks to movie nights at the beach, this is another spot you will not want to miss. Ground fresh daily, from special selected cuts of beef, hamburgers are Al’s specialty. In case this is not your preferred protein, they also have a chicken or tuna burger option, which are prepared with equal amounts of TLC as the beef ones. Vegans don’t worry, Al’s have also thought of you with a plant-based burger option! You can accompany these premium patties with some of their smooth and crunchy homemade french fries, cajun or regular style, some colossal onion rings or sweet potato fries with maple dijon dipping sauce. Yum-my! Delicious fresh salads are also on the menu. There’s a section on the menu for the little ones too (12 or under), where they can choose from more adequate portions for their belly, from mac and cheese, a fresh burger slightly more plain (for a younger palate) or chicken tenders. Handspun milkshakes with fresh ingredients and local craft beer also add to the many reasons we love this bar so much. Every day of the week they have exciting evening entertainment. From fireworks to movie nights, live music and other shows, we believe you will definitely find the right entertainment to fit your mood at Al’s. Live music is a given every night of the week, from solo artists to bands playing blues, jazz, classic rock, indie-soul, contemporary, country and pop. Surround yourself with friends and family and watch the night sky light up on the waterfront, as fireworks blast off from the pier. You can observe this spectacle whilst enjoying a meal seated at our bar or grab a drink and root your feet in the sand as you observe the brilliant Okaloosa Island fireworks. Catch this exclusive display on Wednesdays from 9PM. Now to our favorite part: Movie night at the beach! Family-friendly films are screened on a large inflatable screen one day a week, typically Tuesdays from 8PM. We recommend grabbing some burgers and milkshakes (or why not a beer) from Al’s and then plonk yourself into the sand in a nice comfy spot to enjoy the movie. Did we mention, the movie is FREE? If you want to plan a visit to Al’s but are aiming to enjoy a specific music genre or other event, we recommend you check out Al’s Beach Club and Burger Bar site where they keep an organized calendar of every day’s event and performing artists. You can check out which talent will be performing their music and which movies will be screened, as well as other activities. Location : 1450 Miracle Strip Parkway SE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548 Contact : (850) 226-4100 The Block Visit their website (opens in a new tab) The exterior of this joint won’t strike you as anything out of the ordinary, but step inside and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the diversely fueled atmosphere. The Block is made up of 3 distinct clubs, impeccably merged into 1. The three divisions of this club  are Country Block, Sports/Karaoke Block  and Cell Block. Let’s start with the Country Block side of things. We’re sure you`re great at using your imagination, but it is our pleasure to give you direct insight. Country music. Dancing to live bands. A rough and rowdy mechanical bull called Sugar. Do you have the courage to get up on that bull? The Sports/Karaoke Block is nothing short of pure entertainment. You can catch all the latest sports relaxing at the bar with a cold one and shoot some pool in between. Alternatively show off your vocal talents or just simply sit back, relax and bask in the other local legends of karaoke. With their award-winning drink specials we’re sure you’ll muster up the courage to do some singing with friends. The party aspect is in no way absent from this club! You’ll enjoy the Cell Block if you’re looking to dance the night away. You’ll need the energy to keep up with our locals as they hype up to the best dance and party music, including some pop and rock, all accompanied by a spectacular lighting show. One more thing: As if this club wasn’t diverse enough already, The Block has integrated live comedy specials every Saturday night, with nationally touring comedians, some of which have appeared on Comedy Central, HBO and other channels and programs. Doors open at 6PM and the shows start at 8:15PM. Our conclusion: This multi-ambience club is an ideal choice for many reasons, but especially if you’re looking at staying out after hours.

Offering a chill place to “shuck and suck” with live entertainment, this beach bar with a water view has been a local fave for over 30 years! Open every day from 11 AM to 2AM (except on Mondays when they open at noon), it’s the perfect spot to experience the Florida vibe, and as usual, dress code is flip flops and tee shirts! Boathouse Oyster Bar in Destin – Located at 288 Harbor Boulevard in Destin From the outside, you may be excused for thinking the Boathouse Oyster Bar resembles a fisherman’s shack. Created of weathered boards and unpainted trim, it’s designed to make everyone feel relaxed and at home! A large covered patio area and a simple bar allow guests to enjoy their meals and drinks out by the water and puts them in a better position to take in the tunes; live entertainment adds to the summertime forever vibe! Inside, the walls are covered in dollar bills and baseball caps left by previous patrons, while wood floors, vinyl chairs, and weathered tables continue the impression of a well-loved fisherman’s shack or shanty! The Menu Famous for its award-winning gumbo and oysters, the simple menu makes us very happy. With the exception some appetizers, a chicken dinner, and a prime rib meal, it features seafood, seafood, and yes, you guessed it, MORE seafood! To be honest, our favorite appetizer is not technically seafood related, but you can add shrimp to the Trailer Park Nachos if you want to stay with the theme. From there, although the prime rib is simply delicious, we think you will not be happy unless you order one of their famous buckets! All the buckets share the same fresh ingredients—snow crab clusters, shrimp, crab claws, mussels, oysters, beer, or champagne—the prices only vary due to size. The Jumbo Bucket features what seems to be a hefty price tag of $395, at least until you see that the bucket will serve from 8 to 10 people, creating a party you will never forget! Also offering an oyster brunch from 11 AM until 3 PM on Sundays, the Boathouse Oyster Bar has something to offer every member of your family! Of course, if you’re more in the mood to spend some time kicking back with your friends on a warm Florida evening, The Boathouse Oyster Bar can accommodate that moment as well. This eatery is a particularly popular one amongst locals and visitors alike for its amazing Happy Hour options that you just won’t want to miss. From incredible prices on beer to handcrafted cocktail selections that promise to delight, Happy Hour enjoyed here is one that’s likely to bring you back time and again. When that moment is paired with live musical performances…all the better! Nearby Places to Explore After a Meal The fun atmosphere, amazing menu selections, and savory beverage options at The Boathouse Oyster Bar make it a fan-favorite stop with good reason. That said, a meal or drink enjoyed here can easily be followed up with a visit to nearby fun attractions thanks to the restaurant’s prime location in Destin. Luther’s Pontoon, Waverunner, and Kayak Rentals sits just down the road so if you’re in the mood to get out on the water in style, this is the place to be! They’re open until 5:30 pm each night of the week, so there’s plenty of time to fit an on-the-water adventure onto your post Boathouse itinerary. It’s also entirely possible to take a stroll down to the Heron Harbor Marina is you’re feeling like you could benefit from a fresh air walk after a delicious meal. This marina is a great place to watch the waves roll in or just as easily watch the boats sail by.
