The par-71 course, which measures 6,846 yards from the back tees, opened in 1990 and was designed by Lloyd Clifton. The architect routes through the course through century old oaks covered by Spanish moss, tall Cypress trees, numerous ponds, lakes, and beautiful wetlands.? The course has five sets of tees, starting at 5,104 yards, so it's set up for every level of golfer. The front nine, which is a par 36, is the longer of the two nines at 3,551 yards. It's also where you will find the no. 1 handicap hole, the 443-yard, par-4 third hole. The straightaway hole is not only long, but it's narrow, tree-lined all the way to a green protected by large bunkers. Most of the lakes are located on the back nine. In fact, the largest is between the par-5 first hole and the par-18th, where tee shots lost to the right will find the water. One of the prettiest holes on the course is the 185-yard, par-3 13th, which is all carry over a portion of a lake to the green. In addition to the golf course, Kissimmee Bay Country Club also offers a driving range, short-game area, and practice putting green. Lessons are also available. The club also has its own golf museum as well as a well-stocked golf shop, restaurant, and banquet facilities in the clubhouse. more...

Perfect every aspect of your game! Every golfer has their strengths and their weaknesses. Show your strength on the course but be sure to work on your weaknesses at our practice facilities. Improve your swing on our impeccably-kept driving range or perfect your short game at our putting green or chipping areas. Or better yet: do both! Warm up before your game or de-stress by hitting a few buckets of balls after work. Make it a social event and invite some colleagues from work or bring your grandkids. There are dozens of reasons to take advantage of our practice facilities but you only need one! State-of-the-art practice facilities for your enjoyment. We pour every ounce the same level of dedication into maintaining our practice facilities as we do our golf course. That’s why we’re proud to say that our driving range is 100 percent grass. The views are just as spectacular as the main course, too. Nestled among the cypress and the oak trees, the practice area is designed to ensure that you’ll love every minute of your practice time while you’re here with us. Chipping and putting areas also receive the same level of care. Members are often surprised to hear that our staff replaces the grass in the short game practice area whenever it starts to become worn. That way, when you arrive for your practice session, you’ll always assured of fresh, good grass so you can maximize your practice time. We know your schedule is busy and your practice time may be limited, so it’s important to us that everything is perfect for you and all our guests upon arrival. What are your golfing goals? We’ll help you get there! We’ve been helping golfers of all levels improve their game for a very long time. That’s how we know that everyone has an inner golfer just waiting to come out. Whether you’re a beginner or an old hand at golf, there’s always room for improvement. And of course the best way to tap into your potential is to practice. Practice facilities give you the opportunity to focus on your target areas without feeling the pressure of competition out on the course. Swing, chip, or putt at your own pace to your heart’s content: you’ll see results! And if you’d like to take your game to the next level, remember there’s always someone to offer advice and tips here at Kissimmee Bay Country Club. Stop by the Pro Shop to speak to our friendly staff — they’re always happy to talk shop!

From the moment you arrive here and step foot onto our beautiful grounds, you’ll know that you are someplace very special. When the architects of Kissimmee Bay Country Club’s golf course carved the fairways out of the Florida landscape, they kept all the natural beauty intact. Surrounding the fairways, look for oak trees that date back a hundred years — a rarity in this region. And what gives the course its true Florida charm are the stands of stunning cypress trees, which were preserved from the surrounding landscapes when the course was built. Blend in some classic palm trees to anchor and frame the view and the result is a spectacularly beautiful golf course. It’s easy to see why Golf Digest nominated the course as one of America’s “Best New Courses.” Unique Challenges at Every Turn The course is designed with special attention to detail. There are many design elements to many of the world’s top championship golf courses, including the unique water challenges. Immaculate Playing Conditions We love the game of golf as much as you do, which is why we devote so much attention to the upkeep of our course. From the grass that blankets the course to the marble-white sand that fills the bunkers, it’s all kept up in immaculate condition for the enjoyment of our members and guests. So you’ll find not just breathtaking beauty when you play at Kissimmee Bay, you’ll also find the right conditions for playing your best game every time. Opportunities for Every Golfer Golfers of all abilities will find our course to be accommodating to their own level of play. Our Gold level features 6,830 yards, par 71 play and a challenging slope rating of 132. Besides Gold, there are four other levels of play, all at par 71. They range from 6,317 yards and a slope rating of 123 to 5,104 yards with a very easy slope rating. With five different options, you get to decide how difficult you want the course to be. We invite you to play the course at Kissimmee Bay Country Club. We hope that you will take the opportunity to play our beautiful course here at Kissimmee Bay Country Club. Located just 25 minutes from downtown Orlando and 30 minutes from the airport, it’s not just beautiful and very well-kept, it’s convenient, too. We invite you to stop by and play a few rounds — and if you do, please spend a minute or two in our Pro Shop. We’re always here to answer questions and discuss everyone’s favorite subject: golf!

Kissimmee Bay Country Club Kissimmee, Florida lies just south of Orlando and is located near the Orlando area theme parks. Remington Golf Club and Kissimmee Bay Country Club are located in Kissimmee and just 15min from the Orlando Airport. Both are popular golf venues for many Orlando area golfers. African American Golfers Digest recently visited both courses. I met with the courses’ management representative ChiPing Cheung and Director of Golf John Thomas. Layouts of the courses are unique and provide a different challenge for any golfer. Both courses feature aqua golf driving ranges. Some part of Kissimmee Bay Country borders Lake Tohopekaliga (also known as Lake Toho) which provides a picturesque backdrop for some of its back nine holes. Moss covered oaks and plenty of water provide a pleasant yet challenging golfing experience. My favorite hole on Kissimmee Bay is hole number 15. It is a par 4 beautiful layout with water along the right side all the way to the green. A hazard along the left side and unpredictable winds from Lake Toho makes this a spectacular but treacherous hole. Kissimmee Bay opened in 1989 and is a Lloyd Clifton design. Remington Golf Course, Kissimmee, FL The Clifton, Ezell & Clifton Golf Design Group also designed Remington Golf Club, which was built by Clubcorp and opened in 1996. Remington is known for its smooth fast tiff eagle greens. Many improvements were evident at Remington during my visit. Food service is “par excellence”. The golf experience at both courses is referred to as “World Class Golf at hometown prices”. Remington is home of the “All Day pass” which provides breakfast sandwiches, golf and lunch replay specials for one very competitive price. Mr. Cheung, a Cal Berkeley Engineering graduate who has enjoyed a long career on Wall Street, has been involved with the courses development for the past two years. His love for the game is reflected in the enthusiasm he displays for the success of the courses. He mentioned there are many planned improvements scheduled for both courses. A remodel of the Remington clubhouse was completed since my last visit there. All area African American Golf groups (Tri City Golfers, Pro Duffers Orlando and John Mann’s Pins and skins group) frequently schedule both courses throughout the year. Kissimmee Bay and Remington, as do most Orlando courses, cater to a diverse clientele. Ownership is making a special effort through their relationship with African American Golfer’s Digest to attract more African American golf groups. Kissimmee Bay and Remington offer a special invite to these groups who visit the Orlando area. Whether your group is planning a winter, summer or mid-season golf outing in Orlando, please make sure to include these courses on your itinerary. You may contact the courses directly at (407) 344-4004 to customize a package for your travel group.
