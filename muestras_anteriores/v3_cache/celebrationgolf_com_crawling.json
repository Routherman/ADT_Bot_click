We pay respect to Elders past, present and emerging and recognise their connection to the land. Tree sculpture Thanks to some creative thinking, Eastwood Golf Club now boasts one of the most distinctive natural landmarks of any course in Australia. Adjacent to the 1st tee stood a large Cypress tree that posed a safety risk due to its condition and was earmarked to be removed. However, rather than electing for full removal, the Club recognised an opportunity and instead opted to turn the surviving trunk into a unique work of art. With the assistance of sponsorship from two members, Mike Rawlinson and Roger Earle, the Club commissioned renowned chainsaw sculptor Rob Bast to create a wood carving with the intention of becoming a feature landmark at the course. The design features a golfer with golf bag and clubs, accompanied by birdlife. The project commenced in March 2015 and took two weeks to complete. “The sculpture is simply stunning. Rob did an amazing job and exceeded all our expectations. The skill and level of detail that has gone into the work and what he was able to achieve using chainsaws as his tools is quite incredible,” he comments. “We always thought our course here at Eastwood was special, but we now have a landmark that is truly unique. It has become a major talking point amongst members and guests. Everyone who comes here makes comment on it and usually stop to take photos at the first tee.” contact MEMBERS Quick Links Golf Shop Membership Functions & Dining Lawn Bowls About Us Areas We Serve Eastwood Golf Club Liverpool Rd, Kilsyth 3137 Email admin@eastwoodgolf.com.au Phone (03) 9728 2944 Course Hours Mon to Tue: 07:00am - 05:00pm Wed to Sun: 07:00am - 06:00pm Follow us: Bistro Hours Lunch: Tuesday – Sunday : 11.00am – 2.00pm Dinner: Thursday, Friday : 5.30pm – 9.00pm © Copyright 2025, Eastwood Golf Club | All Rights Reserved | Terms & Conditions |"

Since opening for play in 1996, Orlando golf hasn’t been the same.

Welcome to Celebration Golf Club, one of Orlando’s premier golf facilities. It’s here that you’ll do more than play a course—you’ll feel what it’s like to play the final course co-designed by the renowned masters of golf course architecture, Robert Trent Jones Senior and Junior. In designing Celebration Golf Club an Orlando golf course, their combined talents created a course unlike any other in the nation. It’s lush, almost like a natural park with undulating swells and topography, a course reflective of the very best of every course they have created around the world. IT’S YOUR SHOT!

The staff was so friendly and helpful. Went for a golf outing and it was put so well together. I recommend this place beyond many others in the area. The course was fantastic, tough holes and a lot of water and trees. The greens were true and fast. I cant wait to get down there again and play!”  – Kyle M. Katrin Craft October 3, 2023 ★★★★★ “If you are in the Orlando area for business or pleasure, this course is a must play course. From the dropping off of your clubs, to check in, Range and Starter (especially Paul from Las Vegas) , this place is first class. The course was a bit wet after getting 3-5 inches of rain the weekend before. So it was cart paths only. That was the only negative the whole round. The greens were immaculate and fairways and tee boxes were lush. A must play course in Orlando.”    – Paul L. October 4, 2023 ★★★★★ “My wife and I played Celebration GC for the 3rd time and we both agree that this is one of our favorite courses to play. We try to play a different course in Central  Florida each week. The course is challenging, in excellent condition with quick greens and good fairways. The staff was very friendly and make us feel welcomed We will be back.”       – Paul P.
