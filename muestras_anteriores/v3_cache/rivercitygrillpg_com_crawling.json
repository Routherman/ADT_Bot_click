DOING Our Part TO GIVE BACK Founders Paul and Connie Brady have been in the restaurant business all their lives. Paul started out washing dishes over 30 years ago. He played several key roles at Victoria Station where he\n                                            learned the art of cutting steaks and cooking prime rib. He then opened several Chili's restaurants and went on to help develop the Olive Garden restaurants all over\n                                            the Western United States. Paul ran the Chuy's family of restaurants before he and Connie started River City\n                                            Grille.

MEET Our Team Will DeShazo General Manager Michelle Murray Manager OUR Awards DONATION Requests River City Grille responds to as many donation requests as possible. However, due to the\n                                        frequency and volume of requests, we are, unfortunately, not able to fulfill all requests. The earlier you submit\n                                        your request, the more likely we are to be able to donate to your cause - we request at least 60 days notice.
