Sandoway Discovery Center, offers a glimpse into South Florida’s fragile marine and freshwater environments through educational exhibits and programs. The nature center opened its doors in 1998 and quickly captivated the interest of students, teachers, naturalists, community leaders, visitors and residents of Delray Beach and surrounding communities. The unique facility is an exciting hands-on learning experience, which focuses on Florida’s fragile ecosystems and their inhabitants. Visitors of all ages can get an up-close view of some of Florida’s native and invasive reptile species, meet sharks and other fish at the center’s 15,000- gallon reef pool, explore Southeast Florida’s largest shell collection and join us for special events such as Earth Day and beach clean-ups. The center’s children’s activity room is a great spot to read stories, learn about the life cycle of a butterfly and look at interesting things under the microscope. The observation deck, butterfly garden, and dune exhibit also allow visitors to learn about our unique coastal environment. Sandoway Discovery Center is an historic home where one can experience Delray’s rich natural history through a self-guided tour. The open-air porch, Dade County pine floors, Bald Cypress ceilings, French doors and arched window on the staircase, are just some of the architectural details that evoke impressions of early beach-front living. The nature center’s activities include daily shark and stingray feedings, aquarium feedings, animal encounters, field trip and outreach programs, beach clean-ups, butterfly garden, live animal exhibits, and more. The Friends of Sandoway House Nature Center, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public about Delray’s coastal and marine ecosystems as well as Florida’s natural history all to benefit future generations.

Saturday September 18st from 8am-10am Download Volunteer Form Home • About • History History Sandoway was built for retired produce broker J.B. Evans from Deerfield Beach in 1936.  It is believed that Mr. Evans commissioned local architect Samuel Ogren to design the house as a retirement home.  Mr. Evans was appointed as Lieutenant-Colonel and Personal Aide to Florida Governor Fred P. Cone in 1937.  The position was honorary and consisted of accompanying the Governor on state and ceremonial occasions.  Sandoway is listed in the master site file Inventory of Historic Structures by the Florida Department of State and is also listed in the City of Delray Beach’s Local Register of Historic Places as well as National Register of Historic Places. All of the restoration work done by the Friends of Sandoway House in 1997-98 met the standards prescribed for the rehabilitation of an historic structure as called for by the United States Secretary of the Interior. Sandoway provides cultural significance as it exemplifies the historical, political, economic, and social trends reflected in Delray Beach during the Great Depression .  Designed in a unique style adapted to both the local climate and socio-economic conditions of the nation, the house provides significant clues about the values, lifestyle and social consciousness of the upper-class citizens moving to Delray Beach during the 1930s. In 1995, The Friends of Sandoway House Nature Center, Inc. was formed with the express purpose of restoring the beachfront property for use as a nature museum highlighting marine and coastal life and natural local vegetation. The County of Palm Beach owns the property and leases it to the City of Delray Beach, who, in turn, sublets it to the Friends of Sandoway House. The building and property were opened to the public in May 1998. They started conducting programs for school children during the summer, as well as guiding many families of children and adults through the exhibits and other nature programs offered by the museum. ** Reference ** Sandoway Designation Report, City of Delray Beach Historic Preservation Board, 1996 Want to make a strong impact?
