This month we are highlighting Cueni Brewing Co., pronounced “Q - Knee”, in Downtown Dunedin. When we arrived, the owners, Bren & Jon, were working hard as usual. We were welcomed by the bartender, not to be confused with the owner, Jon aka “ ”Berger.” Immediately we ordered the Florida Beer Flight, consisting of a selection of 13 delicious brews hand picked by Berger and handmade in house. The beers were served on a custom “Linchenberg Figures” flight board which was made by local artist Eric Binkey, owner of Electric Art by Eric. The board is made by applying an electrical current through the wood which leaves unique burn patterns. You have to see it for yourself! Eric also makes the custom beer taps and ring toss games found on the tables. Going outside to the patio area, Bren & Jon shared with us a little about their history. In 2011, their brewing story began with Jon developing a hobby for brewing beer in his kitchen in Powell, Ohio. His hobby started evolving and soon their home became overrun with brewing equipment. They had everything from a room dedicated for grain to chest freezers for fermenting and serving beer. Jon took roughly five years to master his craft. Consistency is one of Jon’s primary focuses. Every time you come to Cueni and order your favorite beer, it’s going to taste how you expect it to. Jon’s obsession with beer derived from his love for Belgian beer, and it’s no surprise that Cueni won Gold for their Belgian 3 Way (Belgian Tripel) in 2018. The development of Cueni’s location was drastic. When they first leased the building, it looked like a condemned building. Jon shared with us that the building didn’t even have running water, instead they had to use a garden hose as a substitute. Business was up and running by November 2016. Cueni opened with four of their first public brews and the remaining taps were filled up by fellow brewers. Cueni has now evolved into making and selling all their own beer. Amazingly, most all of their beers gluten-reduced. This means people with gluten intolerances, like Bren, can enjoy a tasty brew. Jon experimented with different enzymes, brewing processes and several blind taste tests to perfect this. We can guarantee, you won’t be able to tell a difference. Gluten-reduced beer also means you don’t have to leave feeling bloated after a few delicious brews. A few of their popular beers include the HOPscotch IPA (Kyle’s favorite), Aloha Wit (Rachel’s favorite) & the “Move Over I’m Cordial” (Bill’s favorite) which is a Cherry & Vanilla Milk Stout. Jon and Bren are extremely charitable and giving to their community. Bren is always finding ways to support all kinds of local causes. In fact, Cueni was one of our beer providers at our Eat Drink Local section of the Bluegreen Hope Spot festival. They also will highlight a cause by brewing a special beer for it. Right now, Jon and Bren are raising awareness for The Pink Boots Society for Women with their InCOLDnito which is a Cold IPA made with Pink Boots Hops. Other Charity work includes donating every month to either UC Davis, helping with living costs for women going through cancer, Palm Harbor Cares, Suncoast Animal League and more! Cueni is made up of the friendliest staff, every time you stop by Jon & Bren or any of the amazing bartenders, such as Berger, will welcome you as if you were family. While you’re there, make sure to check out the beautiful artwork outside on the patio. Right now, there are two wonderful murals by local Dunedin Artists @KayCoastal and @TheRealMelPoz. If you want to take something home, there’s plenty to choose from at Cueni. There are custom glasses, beer to-go in Crowlers (32 oz.) and Growlers (64 oz.) and stickers. The stickers are free, but they accept donations to be applied to whichever charity they’re currently sponsoring. Cueni also hosts a variety of events that include occasional cooking classes and every Thursday is a beer and Bible study. Make sure to follow them on Facebook to get the latest on their events. Check out @outandaboutdunedin on IG and FB for upcoming events. Including the launch of Cueni’s new beer, Curious Gourd Pumpkin Ale at their “Halfway to Halloween” event, coming April 27th. Located just off the Pinellas Trail at 945 Huntley Ave, Dunedin, FL 34698 their hours of operation are Tuesday through Thursday 3 to 9 pm, Friday and Saturday noon to 11 pm, and Sunday noon to 8 pm. Stop by and tell them The BP Team sent you! Did you know? While the two are similar in color, Stouts and Porters are actually quite different. A Stouts flavor profile is more “roasty,” bitter & sweet. While Porters are more mild and not as bitter.
