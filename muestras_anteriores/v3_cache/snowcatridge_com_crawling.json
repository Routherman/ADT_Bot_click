We want you to have the best day ever! Founded in 2012 by Mike Deacon and Tim Robinson, High Sierra Snowcat was providing a human-powered overnight backcountry experience with the convenience of arriving via snowcat. Drew Layman purchased HSS after more than a decade of experience as a ski patroller and ski guide all over the world. Under this new ownership, HSS will continue to provide high-quality guided adventures with a new focus on cat-skiing throughout the terrain. Located on the East Side of the Sierra Nevada, High Sierra Snowcat combines the use of snowcats, ski touring, and yurts to provide a safe backcountry experience in some of the wildest terrain left in California. We operate within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest with nearly 9,000 acres of skiable terrain across multiple basins surrounding Virginia Lake. We operate under an Outfitting and Guiding permit issued by the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. Our Guides Drew Layman – Owner and Lead Guide Drew is an AMGA Certified Ski Guide, giving him access to guide a wide variety of worldwide locations but he chooses to call the Eastern Sierra home. Before settling in the Eastern Sierra, Drew guided human-powered, cat, and heli-skiing in Alaska, Nepal, Pakistan, Colorado, and Utah. Drew has led multiple successful commercial and personal expeditions to the Himalayas and Karakoram Ranges, Icefield Range in the Yukon, the Kluchevskoy Group in Northeastern Kamchatka, and ski traverses in California. Although he is always scheming the next far-off land to go ski in, he continues to return to the Eastern Sierra year after year. He can’t get enough of the massive descents and generally sunny weather that the Sierra offer and he can’t wait to share it with you! Drew is also an avid climber with multiple significant mountaineering ascents in the Sierras, Cascades, and Alps in his repertoire. He spent much of his youth rock climbing with his family before moving into the back of a Honda Pilot to achieve several big wall ascents of El Capitan in Yosemite. Since then he has spent time developing crags in multiple areas around the U.S. Finally, Drew considers himself a well-rounded outdoorsman with time spent as a competitive mountain bike racer, Class V raft guide, wilderness firefighter, SAR team member, and most recently as a paragliding pilot. Drew can’t wait to share his passion for skiing and vision for High Sierra Snowcat with you and looks forward to the opportunity to experience the High Sierra with you! Certifications AMGA Certified Ski Guide American Avalanche Association Pro II Certification Wilderness EMT Wilderness First Responder PSIA Level 1 Ski Instructor Resort Level Avalanche Forecaster and Route Leader Tessa Andrzejczak – Operations Manager Tessa Andrzejczak is High Sierra Snowcat’s Operations Manager and part of the Guide Team.

She discovered a passion for skiing during college. Since then she has gone on to explore mountains in the High Sierra, New Zealand, and remote corners of Alaska. Tessa’s other love is whitewater rafting, during the summer she can be found as the River Manager for Pangaea River Rafting on the Clark Fork River in Montana. She has a passion for sharing her love of the mountains with others. Whether you interact with her via email, in the front seat of a snowcat, or skiing down a deep powder run her love of the mountains is truly infectious.

He loves spending time with his wife and two children, Laurel and Lundy. Jamie enjoys skiing, hiking, playing hockey and disc golf. Jamie operated snowcats for Mammoth Mountain for 17 years. “Even after all that time, it still impresses me what snowcats are able to do. I am looking forward to being able to build new roads that will get skiers higher up the mountains, which will mean more runs and more fun for everyone.” Mike Mourar – Guide Mike grew up in Pennsylvania where he learned to ski on the icy slopes of the Northeast. He has spends most winters in the Lake Tahoe area and his summers are spent chasing rivers around the Pacific Northwest. Mike learned to guide while studying Outdoor Adventure Education at Feather River College and Southern Oregon University.  “Skiing is my greatest passion, I am fortunate to get to call the beautiful Sierra Nevada Mountains home.” Certifications American Avalanche Institute Pro 2 AMGA Ski Guide Course AIARE Course Leader Wilderness First Responder Bachelor of Science in Outdoor Adventure Leadership Associate Degree in Outdoor Recreation Leadership Molly Massena- Guide Molly originally hails from Eastern Washington where we grew up skiing at a little mom and pop resort on the Idaho-Montana border. Her previous career in Finance didn’t quite scratch the itch, and Molly has now been working in the snow world for 9 years. Her work and play has taken her all over the country as well as internationally. Feel free to ask her about skiing in Japan! She has lived in Mammoth Lakes for 5 years now and when she’s not sliding on the white stuff she works as a rock climbing guide in the area.
