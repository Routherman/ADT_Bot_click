The brewery was founded in 2015 and we are still independently owned and operated. No giant corporate ownership here. Since our opening we have grown significantly, but not without taking the time to make sure everything was done correctly. Quality is always our first priority. Deliberate Growth We have made sure to grow our distribution foot print slowly and organically. We want to watch that our beer is always handled properly and gets to our customers brewery-fresh. We will continue to be thoughtful about where and when our beer is available. Since opening We have doubled the size of the production area in the brewery. Now we have over 15,000 sq. ft of production space! With that we quadrupled our brewing space. We now have the capacity to brew over 5000 barrels a year. That is over 10,000 kegs of beer! True to Our Principles As we have grown, we still have the same high level of standards that we started with on day one. Buy the best north American made equipment, buy the best brewing ingredients available and maintain a happy company culture to make the best beer possible. It is very important to us to know where our equipment and ingredients come from, and also to maintain relationships with those producers. We are proud to go the extra mile. Consider things that normally get outsourced internationally like tap handles. Ours are hand made in Alabama. Some of our stainless steel tanks are built right here in Florida. This is not common in the industry, and also very costly, but it is very important to us. All of the water used for our beer goes through a very thorough purification process before it meets hops and malt. Reverse osmosis takes roughly 95% of the impurities out and then it goes through a UV sterilization process. Once the water is ready it’s time for the freshest hops and ingredients from all over the the world. From Pacific Northwest hops to locally roasted coffee, only the best ingredients make their way into Copperpoint beers.
