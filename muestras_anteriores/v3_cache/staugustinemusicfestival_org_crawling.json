EMMA’s mission is to offer quality music and dance performances by national and international artists. They also aim to encourage interest in classical music and to provide opportunities for the youth of St. Johns County. EMMA accomplishes this by offering school concerts in local schools and funding requests from music teachers for instruments and equipment. Historic Florida Militia The Historic Florida Militia (HFM) is a non-profit umbrella organization supporting re-created historic interpretive units and representing a number of cultures and time periods. \"We are not street performers, we are educators. We are not parades, we are historic programs. This is not an exercise in free speech, this is an opportunity to educate. We are not promoting a political agenda, we are promoting the city's history through a practical and factual teaching method\". Crisp-Ellert Art Museum at Flagler College Built in honor of Dr. JoAnn Crisp-Ellert and her husband, Dr. Robert Ellert, the Crisp-Ellert Art Museum offers Flagler College students and the Northeast Florida community a venue for fostering knowledge and a deep appreciation of contemporary art. As an educational resource for the College, the Museum exhibits regional, national and international artists, and provides opportunities for critical engagement and exposure to a variety of exhibitions and personal interactions with visiting artists. The Museum challenges students, the Flagler community and the public to cultivate individual creativity, critical reflection, historical consciousness and respect for the free exchange of ideas. In this spirit, the Museum also hosts public programs, including artist talks, readings, panel discussions and film series that provide a platform for vital interdisciplinary dialogue.

Musical icons including Bob Dylan, Stevie Nicks, John Legend, Robert Plant, Aretha Franklin, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt and hundreds more have taken the stage. Although, The St. Augustine Amphitheatre is now best known as a world-class music venue, it was constructed for a singular purpose - as the stage and setting for a symphonic outdoor drama by Pulitzer-prize winning playwright, Paul Green.
