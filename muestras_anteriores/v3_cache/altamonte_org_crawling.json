Factors include but are not limited to; the number and type of vendors, event hours and projected attendance figures. Personnel costs are applied to the total cost payable to the City. The City will determine staffing requirements for the anticipated trash generated from the event and provide trash receptacles and clean up staff during and after the event. Position or Equipment Fee Park Rangers $20 per hour, per person Garbage Truck $200 Recycle Truck $200 Street Sweeper $200 Security The City and the Altamonte Springs Police Department (ASPD) expressly reserve the right to determine all security and safety requirements for any event at Cranes Roost Park. They will determine the number of officers and appropriate time frames for each officer based on the applicant’s information. The City reserves the right to require the use of private security to supplement police staffing. Applicants are responsible for all security costs. The ASPD is responsible for determining all security at road closures and within the event site. Considering factors include nature of the event, attendance and if alcohol is present. The police officer fee is $35 per hour, per officer for a 3-hour minimum and a higher fee per hour if a police vehicle is used during the event. These fees are subject to change. A private security company is assigned to the rear entrance/exit of the Altamonte Lakeside Office Park, which is located across from the park’s amphitheater for events requiring closure of Cranes Roost Boulevard. Said company is used to monitor barricades at the intersections of Cranes Roost Boulevard and Uptown Boulevard and Cranes Roost Boulevard and Festival Drive from the start of set up, during the event and until Cranes Roost Boulevard is reopened to vehicle traffic. The applicant is sent a contract from the security company and is responsible for paying this fee prior to the event. Two overnight security staff are required for multi-day events. Events needing an overnight road closure are required to have two overnight security personnel. The City, in conjunction with the Seminole County Fire Department (SCFD), reserves the right to determine all emergency medical services for any event. The SCFD determined whether EMS must be on site and uses the nature of the event, attendance estimates and the presence of alcohol as determining factors. Applicants are responsible for this cost and must pay SCFD directly prior to the event. If the ASPD or SCFD feels it is necessary to place additional staff after the event has started, the event promoter is charged for these services.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why. 4. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies. 5. Online Analytics and Advertising. 6. Information We Disclose. 7. International Users. 8.

Contact Details. 15. Privacy Contacts. Introduction; Scope of this Policy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Governmentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, \"Schooljobs\", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use . Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in the Terms of Use . Any dispute related to privacy is subject to the Terms of Use and this Policy, including limitations on liability. This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion. We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below. Where We Are a Service Provider Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information or your precise geolocation information for timeclock tracking, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a \"data processor\" or \"service provider\" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Any use of analytics or engagement technologies that process personal data, including tools that analyze user behavior or associate usage with identifiers, are implemented solely as a data processor or service provider in these scenarios, and such data is not used by NEOGOV for its own commercial purposes. Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you. For example, a Customer may choose to enable collection of biometric or precise location data for its employees using our time and attendance product. We process such data only at the direction of that Customer and do not use it for our own purposes. Further, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services. Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer. Personal Data We Collect About You and Why. In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year.

Among other reasons, we use various cookies and other tracking technologies to provide our Services, authenticate users when visiting our Services, for security purposes (e.g., to prevent fraudulent use of the Services and protect our Services generally), track your preferences, provide personalized recommendations of content, features, and Services, deliver more relevant ads to you as you browse the web, including ads on websites and applications other than on our Services, and help us understand how our websites and communications are being used. For more information on Cookies see the “Cookies and similar Tracking Technologies; “Do Not Track” section immediately below. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include: A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things. HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Microsoft Edge , Google Chrome , Mozilla Firefox , or Apple Safari ). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services. Online Analytics and Advertising Online Analytics We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Hubspot, LinkedIn, Hotjar, Gainsight and others. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. In some cases, we may also associate analytics and usage data with identifiers such as your name or email address, but only as needed to enable our Customers to analyze user engagement, feature usage, or onboarding effectiveness. These tools are used solely on behalf of our Customers to support the Services they direct us to provide.  For example, we use Gainsight to support in-product analytics and engagement, on behalf of our Customers, and subject to our role as a service provider. Tailored Online Advertising We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. These third-party advertising technologies may include Google Ads, DoubleClick, Twitter, AddThis, ShareThis, and others. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.  If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.  You can also use the options below in the \"Rights Regarding Your Information\" section below. Please note that you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.

Notice to California Residents If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information. Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.

Additional California Privacy Rights In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.” The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA. Shine the Light California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at privacy@neogov.com . Do Not Track Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here . Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR. Data Controllers and Processors. Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing. Lawful Basis for Processing. For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including: Consent. In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy. Legitimate Interest. We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests. Performance of a Contract We process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service. Other Legal Bases. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims. Automated Decision Making and Profiling. We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you. Data Security and Integrity. We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us. Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password. Retention and Removal. For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law. Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application. Right to Revise.
