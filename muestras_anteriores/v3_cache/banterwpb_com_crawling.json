That’s CUPRA’s mantra, and this week, Melbourne felt it.\n\nWe at Banter helped launch the bold new CUPRA Terramar while marking three years of CUPRA Australia in style.\n \nFrom media drives to a 200-person takeover of The Timber Yards, the week was full of energy, edge and expression. Spanish-Aussie chef Miguel Maestre brought the heat and the charm, serving up flavour with serious flair.\n \nTo close it out, we flipped the venue into a late-night party with Balearic vibes. A big finish for a big week.\n \nThanks to the legends at CUPRA Australia.

Proof that when you back women’s sport, everyone wins.\n\nWe were chuffed to see all three partner teams make the finals and are even happier to see Aware Super on the dresses of both sides going head-to-head this Sunday.\n\nBest of luck to the Melbourne Vixens and Netball WA & West Coast Fever for this weekend!\n\nIf you're a marketer thinking about women's sport, just do it! …more 10 Like Comment Share Banter 4,086 followers 1mo Report this post For two years, we backed Surf Life Saving Australia with everything we had.\n\nWe fought for the cause, stretched every cent, and poured our heart into every brief.\n\nNine months ago, we launched a campaign we are still seriously proud of.\n\nIf you know Banter you know we scrap for what matters. \n\nWe chase the yes. \n\nAfter endless calls, emails and a heap of hustle, we convinced former Nipper Angus Sampson to front the 2024 summer campaign for a fraction of his usual fee.\n\nThe result? Millions of earned media impressions. More importantly, 37,000 downloads of the new Beach Passport.

Sure that helps. But there's more to it. It’s about connecting with real fans, in real moments, in ways that actually matter.\n\nThat’s what we at Banter helped Aware Super do, shaping a sponsorship strategy across four teams in two codes, designed to drive genuine connection and meaning. \n\nAnd last weekend, it came to life at the first Super Helpful Game with the GWS GIANTS . \n\nWe brought the spotlight to the people who keep our communities running. From nurses to firefighters, teachers to ambo, with 250 local heroes recognised on the big screen, across socials, and in a moment of collective cheers at quarter-time.\n\nBecause when you get sponsorship right, it’s more than just branding.

Some wear scrubs, hi-vis, or simply carry a quiet determination to help others. \n\nThrilled at Banter to be helping Aware Super launch the inaugural Super Helpful Game with the GWS GIANTS , a special occasion to recognise and celebrate the everyday super helpful people who keep our communities strong. \n\nFrom frontline workers and nurses to teachers and carers, these are the people who quietly go above and beyond every day, often without seeking recognition. \n\nThis Sunday July 12th, 250 everyday heroes from health and emergency services will be celebrated with game tickets, big-screen shoutouts, and a special quarter-time tribute. \n\nHere's to those that are Super Helpful! 11 Like Comment Share Banter 4,086 followers 2mo Report this post Yesterday our very own Lucie Drysdale spoke at the Flaunt Talent Discovery Day alongside a number of other very well-credentialed and experienced humans. \n\nLucie spoke to her first year in the industry to help inspire the next cohort of graduates. \n\nBig ups Lucie. 18 2 Comments Like Comment Share Banter 4,086 followers 2mo Report this post One year of Banter 2.0.\n\nTwelve months ago, we hit go on our next chapter: fully independent, fiercely ambitious and ready to build something bold.\n\nSince then:\n\n- We’ve grown from 7 to 13. Still tight-knit, just a little louder in the kitchen.\n\n- Designed and built our own HQ in Rosebery. It’s creative, full of life and yes, it has dogs and drinks.\n\n- Backed emerging talent, gave them space to grow and watched them do awesome things.\n\n- Promoted from within, including one superstar who got the nod on her first day back from mat leave.\n\n- Helped brands rethink sponsorships: rewriting, renegotiating and reframing what great looks like.\n\n- Built mobile games for the footy. Turned kids’ drawings into centrepieces at Vivid. Reimagined consumer promotions with a dash of AR magic.\n\n- Introduced Australia to Gilli Danda. Because cricket (and culture) deserves it.\n\n- Delivered employee experiences, dreamy dinners, media events, expo stands and big activations that sparked real buzz and made noise IRL and URL (see what we did there).\n\n- Launched pop-ups that stopped people in their tracks, from spirits to boots to ice cream.\n\n- Ran one of Australia’s biggest influencer campaigns with a TikTok takeover. Big spreadsheets. Big talent. Big results.\n\n- Created culture-shaping work with some of Australia’s most-loved talent and a few soon-to-be cult favourites.\n\n- Welcomed an industry powerhouse in PR and Social to lead our newest offering. Already, five amazing clients have put their trust in us, including a few household names and some we’re soon to make part of the household.\n\n- And in an industry famous for churn, we’ve kept our 9.5-year streak alive. Not a single teammate lost to a competitor. Just good people sticking around and growing together. Legends, every one of you.\n\nWe’re still small. Still scrappy. Still very hungry.\n\nSuper proud of our first year as an indie agency. Massive thanks to all our clients, collaborators and mates who made the last twelve months fly by.\n\nThe countdown to turning 10 is officially on.
