Legend Reviewed Apr. 20, 2024 Nice, quiet, well maintained, friendly, wooded CG on the water We have a 36 ft Class A with a Cherokee Trailhawk tow and stayed in site 132 for 3 days in mid April. The CG is very clean, well maintained, but relatively expensive. The CG is a mixture of long-term and transient folks. The roads are paved, but the sites are sandy, shelly gravel. The staff is friendly and very helpful. They have beach chairs near the water and a fire pit that they lit every evening near sunset. In addition to the Bark Park area, there is a nice wooded area where you can walk your dog as well. AT&T coverage was pretty good, with 3-4 bars of 5G service and speeds up to 11 MB/s. The CG has a lot of trees, but the sites in the front of the park are pretty open. We had no line-of-site to the DISH satellites, but did have an open view north, so Starlink usable, but the CG had WiFi and we were right across from the antenna, so we didn’t use Starlink. The CG WiFi achieved speeds up to 8 MB/s. Site 123 Month of Visit April Share Report S Sarah B. Scout Reviewed Sep. 22, 2023 Great place to stay on the water! Awesome campground on the Anclote River!

It’s Florida so it’s a tight fit in every spot. The staff we’ve met so far have been very friendly and helpful. It’s close to a lot of fun places to go and great beaches to see.

The CG is very clean, well maintained, but relatively expensive.  The CG is a mixture of long-term and transient folks.  The roads are paved, but the sites are sandy, shelly gravel.  The staff is friendly and very helpful.  They have beach chairs near the water and a fire pit that they lit every evening near sunset.  In addition to the Bark Park area, there is a nice wooded area where you can walk your dog as well. AT&T coverage was pretty good, with 3-4 bars of 5G service and speeds up to 11 MB/s.  The CG has a lot of trees, but the sites in the front of the park are pretty open.  We had no line-of-site to the DISH satellites, but did have an open view north, so Starlink usable, but the CG had WiFi and we were right across from the antenna, so we didn’t use Starlink.  The CG WiFi achieved speeds up to 8 MB/s.

We recently moved to Florida, staff did not explain about super low tides and dangerous red tide, and happily assigned a dock for the boat which was useless as by 6 PM the boat was sitting on the mud.  red tide brought dead fish everywhere, so not a great view neither.  All of that was OK as rookie mistake as we are getting to know the area, but then they charged more money for the extra days due to “holiday rates” they did not explain.  After we left they charged extra for some excess “electricity” because we stayed for a week. We have stayed in more than 15 campsites over the last 12 months and NEVER experienced a campground with very basic/few amenities that is so expensive and on top of that keeps charging you for so many different charges and made up rules.  This is the classic TOURIST TRAP with the access to water used as the “bait”.  You can go to “Vickie’s” grill nearby and/or launch your boat from the Anclote Park to enjoy the views without the extra charges, surprises and headaches.

We stayed for two months and loved every day at this little park. The waterfront area and beach were perfect for hanging out after work and watching the dolphins and pelicans. Our pup loved the dog park area. The trees in the park were beautiful. The park is conveniently located near a new bike trail and several county parks that we enjoyed. If you’re looking for a resort style park with a ton of amenities, this is not it. But it was a peaceful, laid back, well maintained, awesomely located park for us. Cell phone signal was strong. My husband and I both work remotely and had no issues with AT&T here. Some of the sites were a little tight, but we were perfectly content with ours. We would definitely return to Hickory Point!

Ride safe and have a blast at Idaho Dunes RV! Meet the Team Mike McGroarty Owner Mike McGroarty has been an off-road, aviation, and outdoor enthusiast his entire life.  At the age of 15, Mike earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America and by that time had over 300 nights of wilderness camping experience.  His love for the outdoors turned into a passion for off-roading as soon as his first job earned him enough income to purchase his first sport ATV.  This first ATV started an addiction for rock crawling, trail riding and sand duning that still occupies 100% of Mike’s interest to this day. Garrett McGroarty Manager Garrett McGroarty was born into the “Idaho Dunes Way of Life”.  At 3 years old, Garrett started his off-road passion on a Kawasaki KFX 50.  Garrett has logged more trail miles between Idaho Dunes RV and West Yellowstone than anyone in the area.  At a young age, Garrett developed a passion for helicopters and aviation.  Before graduating from high school, Garrett earned both his private helicopter license (PPL-H) and commercial helicopter license (CPL-H).  With advanced pilot training from the best instructors in the industry at Helisafe in Southern California, Garrett has mastered the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopters flight systems and emergency procedures.  If you have questions about the campground, dunes, local area, trail rides, or helicopter tours Garrett is your best bet to get the answers you are looking for.
