So this month, let me add two more of his instructional pointers: 1.\tFor Manuel, all good golf swings begin with a grip where the two hands face each other as they wrap around the handle of the golf club. As you wrap your hands around the club, be sure to grip without choking the life out of it. Remember, the golf club is your friend, not your enemy. 2.\tAll good golf swings incorporate a balance between a relaxed and athletic stance, with slightly flexed knees and arms that hang without tension. From this setup, golfers can generate a smooth swing with a consistent tempo. Hopefully, these tips help you the next time you tee it up. TUESDAY NIGHT SCRAMBLE Last week we finished our fourth month of Tuesday Night Scrambles. Between 12 and 18, four-man teams have competed for weekly cash prizes and skins. Tuesday, July 20th, 72 players came ready to play for a $360 cash purse and a skin package worth $1600. With that said, the team of Dave Mack, Justin Knapp, Danny Hamilton, and Joe Porfidio eagled hole number 9 for the “lone” skin. Congratulations, guys!

It is important to note that the Red Nine property, measuring over 100 acres in area, was closed in a short period of time after it was established because it was not profitable. It is an unproductive property that stalls the future improvement and upgrade of the operating golf club.  Consequently, we must always be looking for ways to improve the business and financial position of the Club.  At present, we are spending over $40,000 per year in mowing fees, insurance, and taxes to maintain a property that generates no profits.  This is an untenable business position. The Red Nine property has generated great interest among residential as well as commercial developers over the past several years.  We have received numerous unsolicited offers to purchase this property for development for a variety of options. All of these offers have been rejected outright because the developer’s proposals to construct crowded houses, undersized lots or other options would incur significant impacts on the fabric of the community. A builder recently expressed interest in building houses on certain portions of the Red Nine, and there are exploratory discussions underway.  The builder has developed a preliminary plan with views of house locations and associated lot/house sizes to determine the economic viability of the proposal.  The City informed the builder that the Magnolia Point PUD and zoning must be changed. These changes require Council action as well as HOA and Community involvement. We are not under any contractual obligation with any and all options but have been in communication with the HOA board. With no tangible or concrete proposal, all speculations and conversations are premature. We are well aware of the community’s impact and are absolute in our resolve to find a solution with complete transparency to any development. We are dedicated to preserving the financial health and viability of the community while ensuring that new development incurs no adverse effects.  We look forward to sharing more detailed information as it moves from an indeterminate position and enlisting your participation as we move forward. Thank you, Deneen and Trevor Rothfels Owners of Magnolia Point Golf and Country Club"
