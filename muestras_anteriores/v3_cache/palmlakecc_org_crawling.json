Getting to know so many small businesses located on beautiful Vancouver Island has been an amazing experience Fairs & Markets I am proud to present the fairs and markets I have the pleasure of organizing past and present.

The event will feature: 80+ Multicultural Food Vendors & Trucks Various Music Artists Dance Performances Live DJ & Band Food Competition and Contests Kids Activities including Waterslide and Inflatables Raffles for chance to win BIG prizes We spoke with the organizers about the event! What is the Saigon Night Market like for those who have never been before? The Saigon Night Market can be described in three words. Culture, Community, and Diversity. Through music, multicultural food, and entertainment, we highlight various Asian cultures, and provide a space in which anybody of any culture can enjoy. How much does everything cost for attendees? The festivals are very affordable. Entry is $10 per day, or $15 for both Saturday/Sunday. We provide convenient parking spaces at $20 per car if you are unable to find nearby parking. And vendors price their food very fair! For the experience we deliver, including Live Band, Lion Dance, Dance Performers, and Musical Acts, you can bet that it’ll be an experience worthwhile. What kind of food will be available? What is unique? The food options are endless. To name a few, we have Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Korean, Filipino, and even Latino food vendors. You can spend the whole day and not eat the same food twice! A few unique bites that people may not have had the opportunity to taste would be grilled chicken feet, Balut, Lao sausage, and the savory Filipino desserts. Tell us about the organizers? The organizers consist of two Vietnamese friends. One being an entrepreneur, and the other being a music artist. We came together to do a fun project for the community without thinking much of it, but it eventually grew and became known as the Saigon Night Market. Along the way, we’ve met many people that we’ve been blessed to be able to share this journey with as one big family. What type of vendors are you looking for? The more diverse the better. Anybody and everybody is welcome to vend. At times, when we see we have too many vendors of a specific culture, we tend to focus on picking up different types of vendors to make sure everyone gets a chance to showcase their foods. How can vendors / sponsors sign up? Vendors and sponsors can reach out via email ( saigonnightmarketfl@gmail.com ). How to buy a ticket? Tickets are sold at the gate, or available on Eventbrite for pre-purchase. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/endless-summer-music-food-festival-tickets-907987895237 Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Print Must Read Pumpkin Season at Metro Diner Returns with Pumpkin Pancakes, Waffles, and Bread Pudding Ricky Ly - UPCOMING EVENT: Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Food & Wine Classic returns November 14-15 Ricky Ly - H Mart Orlando Announces Opening Date – September 25, 2025 Ricky Ly - New Omakase at illume Rooftop Bar & Lounge – JW Marriott Bonnet Creek Tiffany Nguyen - Inside Look: Tempo + Grace at Aloft Lake Nona Hotel Ricky Ly - Previous article NEW Next Generation ABC Fine Wine & Spirits with Whiskey Tastings opens in Winter Garden, Florida Next article Upcoming Event: World of Whiskey Event at Orlando World Center Marriott on June 15, 2024 Related Articles Pumpkin Season at Metro Diner Returns with Pumpkin Pancakes, Waffles, and Bread Pudding UPCOMING EVENT: Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Food & Wine Classic returns November 14-15 H Mart Orlando Announces Opening Date – September 25, 2025 New Omakase at illume Rooftop Bar & Lounge – JW Marriott Bonnet Creek LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Log in to leave a comment Downtown Magazine PRO Facebook Instagram Twitter Youtube About Foodie Faves Interviews Food Travels Recipes Contact TastyChomps.com A Local's Culinary Guide About Foodie Faves Interviews Food Travels Recipes Contact Latest Pumpkin Season at Metro Diner Returns with Pumpkin Pancakes, Waffles, and Bread Pudding Orlando Sep 7, 2025 0 Established in 1992 as a family-owned eatery in Jacksonville, Florida,...
