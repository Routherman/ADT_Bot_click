Thanks to her dad’s relentless determination to make an asado every other day, Denise got to spend most of her time as a kid exploring the city parks while her dad grilled away. It’s always been a dream of Denise’s to explore more of the natural world outside of the cities she lived in, but the natural world was far, inaccessible, and daunting to her and her family. Denise’s fascination for plants and nature led her to study Environmental Horticulture at UC Davis. It was there that Denise got to go on her first hike. This was a life changing experience for her and she now spends most of her spare time hiking and fishing/crabbing around her home in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a Latino Outdoors Programs & Operations Associate, Denise will help provide Latinx communities opportunities to explore the outdoors by ensuring that programs run smoothly. Denise looks forward to helping grow the Latino Outdoors community and is excited to help bring more people out into the kinds of spaces that have been so pivotal to her own life.

Email: josie@latinooutdoors.org New Mexico Regional Coordinator Laura Flores (she/her) Laura Flores (she/her) has loved the outdoors from a young age. Growing up you would find her riding her bike or climbing the Ash tree in her front yard. She spent many hours outside using her imagination to keep herself entertained. Her love for the outdoors has continued to grow as did her desire to share these outdoor opportunities with her community. She became an educator in Albuquerque, New Mexico where she taught for 14 years. During this time she was able to introduce her students to local outdoors resources and the importance of protecting them. Now as a Latino Outdoors Regional Coordinator for New Mexico, Laura will continue to work with the community to ensure access to local resources, lift up local voices and history, and make sure these spaces are clean and safe for our next generation. Email: lauraflores@latinooutdoors.org Programs & Operations Manager Luis Rincón (he/him/él) Luis was born and raised in Fresno and is excited to be immersed into an organization where his passion for the outdoors, organization, community, and events are combined into one. Luis recalls that his initial passion for the great outdoors was inspired on the fateful day it snowed in Fresno in 1998, an extremely rare occurrence in Fresno. He was amazed seeing snow for the first time and discovered how fascinating nature can be and how it can change over time. Years later, Luis took a trip with his sister to Yosemite and it reignited that same passionate feeling and reverence for the beauty of the outdoors. Although it took him a little while to figure it out, that memory inspired him to pursue a Bachelors of Science degree in Recreation and Community Events at Fresno State University. On weekends, Luis and his friends enjoy exploring and hiking new trails. Luis has over eleven years of administrative support experience at Fresno State University and is excited to bring his experience to Latino Outdoors to assist in any way possible. As the Programs and Operations Associate, he is committed to supporting others, ensuring everything is organized and running smoothly. Luis looks forward to learning and growing both personally and professionally with Latino Outdoors. Email: rincon@latinooutdoors.org Communications Associate Luisa Vargas (she/her/ella) Luisa was born in Colombia and immigrated to Florida when she was 6 months old. Her circumstances and parents encouraged a life connected with the outdoors. Before joining Latino Outdoors, she worked with the Texas Conservation Corps. She will be sharing our comunidad’s stories in hopes of empowering others to experience nature in a way that feels right to them—whether that’s mountaineering or enjoying a book on a park bench—we’re all a part of Latinos Outdoors. Email: luisavargas@latinooutdoors.org New York & Northeast Regional Coordinator Melodie Mendez (she/her/ella) Mel was born and raised in the Bronx, New York.

Most recently, she served as a Strategic Communications Manager for the Natural Resources Defense Council, supporting portfolios in food, agriculture, toxics, and extreme weather. Mel joined the Latino Outdoors family back in 2018 as a general member in the New York City chapter and has since volunteered as an Outings Leader and Program Coordinator. As the New York & Northeast Regional Coordinator, Mel is committed to building equitable access for Latine communities in the outdoors, and elevating the metropolitan perspective into the outdoor narrative.

Email: melmendez@latinooutdoors.org Director of Programs & Operations Ruby Rodríguez (she/her/hers) Ruby was born and raised in Fresno, California, where she was exposed to various forms of the outdoors. Countryside, she ventured into a eucalyptus-lined dirt ditch during the summer months of her childhood. The ditch offered a concrete bridge at one end and pond at the other—perfect for splashing around with tadpoles and water striders. The adjacent open field lent itself to Ruby’s introversion and fondness of plant life, ladybugs, and daydreaming. Though her conscious connection to nature fell dormant after a move to the city’s Tower District, remnants of it presented itself in her admiration of the front yards she passed during walks to school. In her early adult years, Ruby found her way to the orchards in nearby Sanger, which inspired a trip to Yosemite National Park. There, she became overwhelmed by the reawakening of her biophilia and has since advocated for outdoor recreation, in its varied forms, as an antithesis to oppression. Ruby’s desire to learn more about where outdoor recreation and self-determination intersect led her to Humboldt State University, where she studied as an undergraduate. During this time in her life and as a Latino Outdoors community member, Ruby enjoyed adding her voice to the conversation about diversifying the outdoor identity. She eventually took the next step from a community member to volunteer and has since grown her role within the organization. As the Director of Programs & Operations, Ruby is fiercely passionate about elevating and advocating for LO volunteers as leaders worthy of investing in. She provides vision and leadership to staff and a national network of over 200 volunteers, oversees the day to day operations, and continuously seeks out creative and meaningful ways to advance the LO mission, all while maintaining her appetite for learning and personal growth. Email: rubyjean@latinooutdoors.org Development Manager Vanessa Herrera (she/her) Vanessa Herrera is originally from the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles. She grew up playing outside with her primos in her family’s backyard and neighborhood parks. In middle school, she was introduced to the wilderness through her school’s Outdoor Education Program. Outdoor Education gave her access to wild places and adventure sports that she never knew existed. From then on, camping, hiking, and multi-day rafting trips have been a large part of her life. Her passion for rivers led her to work as a river guide on the Kern River in California, the Arkansas River in Colorado, the Río Pescados in Veracruz, Mex, as well as various rivers in Costa Rica. She is happiest when floating downstream and is always excited to introduce new people to the joy of rivers. Vanessa received her bachelor’s degree from UC Santa Cruz in Latin American Studies and her masters in education from UCLA. She has spent the last 20 years in education and the nonprofit sector. When she is not working, you can find her playing outdoors in and along the Kern River or swimming in the Pacific Ocean with her sons and her dog. She is excited to combine her love of the outdoors with her passion for social justice in her role as development manager for Latino Outdoors. Email: vanessaherrera@latinooutdoors.org SF Bay Area Regional Coordinator Aurora Cortés (she/her/hers) Aurora Cortes was born and raised in Santa Ana, CA. Growing up, she worked with her dad, un jardinero, and helped weed plants, rake debris, and mow the lawn. Aurora went on family camping trips to the Angeles National Forest. She celebrated many birthdays with her family amongst the trees, in the snow, and under the stars. As she grew older, she loved listening to stories that her mom and dad shared from their own experiences back home in Mexico from el ahijadero and la florenia . All the family stories and childhood experiences planted the seed of adventure and love for the outdoors for Aurora. As the SF Bay Area Regional Coordinator, Aurora will engage and empower people to connect to beautiful natural lands and create a comfortable space for people to share their stories and create new memories. Aurora will continue to organize community-based programs and seek partnerships and collaboration opportunities for the community to come together and celebrate language, traditions, and culture in the outdoors.

Email: cassandra.castillo@latinooutdoors.org Colorado Regional Coordinator Crystal Salvador-Zapote (she/they) Crystal (she/they) was born and raised in Clearwater, FL and spent most of her summers in Mexico where she fell in love with the mountains and the high desert. After graduating from college she found herself spending more and more time outdoors, meditating and trail running. Unhappy with her corporate job, she decided to volunteer for a crisis line and the National Suicide Hotline. This prompted her to think of the connection between mental wellness and the natural world. Having only been camping twice before, Crystal decided to move to Utah to pursue a job in wilderness therapy as a backpacking guide and counselor. This work sparked her interest in diversifying the outdoors and engaging Latino communities in the outdoors. Crystal is passionate about breaking down barriers for marginalized communities and continues to be an advocate for mental health. As the Colorado Regional Coordinator for Latino Outdoors, Crystal is excited to engage with the Colorado community, continue developing strong relationships with community partners, and support the vision of Latino Outdoors’ incredible volunteers. Crystal currently resides in Denver with her two sweet kitties. She enjoys volunteering with queer and Latinx youth and families, and as a Restorative Justice practitioner. In her free time you’ll find her dancing, reading, attending a concert, or spending time with her community. Email: crystal@latinooutdoors.org Executive Director Luis Villa (he, his, él) (he/him/él) Born in Los Angeles, California, Luis is the oldest of five sons to parents from Mexico’s state of Jalisco . The outdoors has always called out to him, including its more subtle expressions, such as his childhood home’s backyard complete with a beautiful, bountiful Persea americana tree that, at approximately 75 years old, gifts several hundred avocados each season to family, friends, and neighbors. Growing up next to the Los Angeles River offered an odd connection to the outdoors. Its concrete riverbed somewhat absurdly serving as a bike path one summer for 10-year-old Luis to pedal from Lynwood all the way to the river’s mouth in Long Beach. In high school, he participated in urban hikes all over southern California, as a member of the marching band. The summer after graduating high school, Luis took up  recreational running, first around the perimeter of a city park, and then around the Princeton and Stanford campuses, where he studied as an undergraduate. While at Stanford, Luis enjoyed one of his most memorable outdoor experiences, an exhilarating hike along a portion of the Skyline-to-the-Sea trail organized for incoming transfer students. Beginning inside the magical coast redwood forests of Big Basin Redwoods State Park, it climbed to a breathtaking vista point of the Santa Cruz Mountains and dropped onto Waddell Beach with the Pacific Ocean as an endless backdrop. After graduating with a BA in psychology, Luis began a career dedicated to the nonprofit work, first as a youth case manager in south central Los Angeles, then a program manager with Opportunity Fund, a San Jose, CA-based community development financial institution, and a project manager with Charities Housing, a Bay Area nonprofit affordable housing developer. During this time, Luis took his running and hiking to the trails of Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve, part of the complex of preserves under the stewardship of Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District , and promptly experienced poison oak’s unpleasantness for the first time. Bitten by the travel bug, Luis ventured to Costa Rica to volunteer with Habitat for Humanity for several months and ultimately moved there. While in Central America, Luis worked with Nectandra Institute , a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation and restoration of tropical cloud forests. (Interestingly, Nectandra, a tree genus emblematic of cloud forests, belongs to the same family, Lauraceae, as the avocado tree from Luis’ childhood.) As Chief Operating Officer, he was responsible for Nectandra’s administrative operations while also managing the Institute’s Eco-Loan Fund, a conservation land acquisition financing program. Wearing rubber boots, Luis found himself running up and down sloping muddy pastures, evaluating eco-loan requests from Nectandra Institute’s community partners looking to acquire important watershed lands, restore the forest on these, and thus improve protection for the mountain springs they depend on for clean drinking water. After twelve years abroad, Luis returned to California with a keener appreciation for nature and the outdoors, whether walking around a city or trekking through a forest. As Executive Director for Latino Outdoors, Luis continues to run, now alongside LO’s extraordinary staff and powerful network of volunteer leaders, working together to shape, share, and celebrate the experiences of comunidades latinas outdoors.

Growing up in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, André was raised in the agriculturally-fueled and Latine-dominated community of Madera, CA. A community where working the land was the norm and recreating in nature seemed foreign to most members. Fortunately, one of André’s immigrant uncles discovered the joys of getting outdoors and shared the discovery with the family. Through several impactful family trips to the Sierra Nevada mountains and iconic Yosemite National Park, André ultimately developed a passion for conservation and restoration work. This passion led him to earn his B.S. in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology from UC Davis. Thereafter, André went on to work for several state and federal agencies, where he worked on habitat restoration and wildlife monitoring projects, including conducting amphibian surveys for Yosemite National Park and monitoring trout populations in southern California’s Santa Monica Mountains. After gaining perspective from his work experiences, André returned to school to pursue an M.S. in Natural Resources with a Watershed Management emphasis at Humboldt State University. Now residing again in the Madera/Fresno area, André serves as the San Joaquin Valley Organizer for CalWild, where he engages, informs and organizes the area’s communities to advocate for and protect public lands, including some of the outdoor places and ecosystems that inspired him. Outside of this, André coaches youth wrestling and loves to backpack, hike, rock climb, and simply observe nature’s raw beauty. As the Latino Outdoors Volunteer for Sacramento, André works towards inspiring others about the importance of protecting natural resources by sharing his knowledge of rivers, wildlife, and the different environmental services they provide for people, including clean water, clean air, and respite from everyday life. As a member of the Board, he hopes to further this effort and expand his support of LO’s mission. Chairperson Claudia Pineda Tibbs (they/them/elle) Claudia Pineda Tibbs is a first-generation Salvadoran-American, scientist, birder, environmental educator, and ocean conservationist.

A transformative leadership training with Justice Outside grounded in equity and cultural healing further shaped her belief that everyone deserves access to safe, inclusive outdoor experiences. Today, Adriana volunteers with Latino Outdoors Fresno, leading bilingual, intergenerational outings that uplift QTBIPOC communities and reconnect people with nature. She also works in community development, helping elevate resident voices in water and land use planning across the region.

That realization led her to integrate fitness and the outdoors into her life, ultimately fueling her passion for making movement more accessible, inclusive, and sustainable for others. Now, in addition to her work in business strategy and community impact, she collaborates with organizations such as Denver Parks & Recreation, Special Olympics Colorado, and the Colorado Wildlife Federation to create pathways for historically excluded communities to engage in movement, recreation, and outdoor experiences. A passionate advocate for inclusive outdoor spaces, Aimara enjoys hiking, mountaineering, and strength training.

Outings Leader Alexa Ortega Senter (she/her/ella) Alexa’s roots go back at least seven generations in California, and her mixed-race identity reflects this land’s long, rich, and complicated colonial history. Growing up connected to and with the plants, animals, and geology of Central California was a grounding force during a sometimes chaotic childhood. For over 15 years, Alexa has worked with farmers, chefs, and nonprofits to develop inclusive marketing and communications campaigns that explore and strengthen the link between the land, the people who cultivate it, the food it produces, and the people it feeds. As a Latino Outdoors Outings Leader for the SF Bay Area, Alexa is excited to be part of outings that allow us all to deepen our relationships with the natural world around us and the people we share it with throughout the seasons of the year and our lives.

Outings Leader Ali Garza Ali was born and raised in Falfurrias, Texas, a small community ninety miles north of the Mexican border, where his love and appreciation for the outdoors began. Summers were spent with his grandparents. He was always curious about the various types of wildlife and plants that filled the property. Early morning walks with his Grandpa started his education of the outdoors. He would ask all kinds of questions: What are we planting today? What kind of critter makes that sound? Simple questions to some, but answers that would last a lifetime. Eventually, Ali would join Boy Scouts where his curiosity would pivot from his grandparents’ backyard to various summers camps and activities. During this time, he would learn from others but also share the knowledge that he had gained from his grandfather. Now as an adult, Ali continues to learn and share his love for the outdoors with his San Antonio community. Ali has been volunteering with Latino Outdoors San Antonio for the past two years, helping with various tabling events and making sure things ran smoothly in the background. For the last year he’s taken on the role Social Media Manager, where’s he’s been able to really connect and network with his San Antonio Community. Together with his partner Elaine, he continues to explore all that Texas has to offer. He continues to be that curious scout wanting to learn and he continues to share what his grandfather taught him all those years ago. Outings Leader Allen Cárdenas (he/him) Allen is from Modesto, California. After growing up in the Central Valley, he moved to Washington, D.C. to study at American University where he majored in International Studies and Spanish. It was during this time when he developed his passion for the outdoors. Influential professors, firsthand accounts of environmental injustice, and the love of simply being outside allowed him to see the intersectionality between the outdoors and justice. After traveling and seeing diverse landscapes, Allen was comforted to see how easy it was to connect with so many different people over nature, a fire, or a drink of water on trail. Allen serves as a Washington Outings Leader and lives in Seattle. He hopes to create and facilitate programming that is inclusive of varying abilities and skill levels. His favorite part about volunteering is taking someone on their very first hike. However, he also hopes to show that nature does not have to be a far-away, romanticized concept, but it can also be as accessible as exploring our own neighborhood. Allen works for the National Park Service as an Outdoor Recreation Planner – Visitor Use Management Specialist in the Park Planning division. There he helps parks address issues related to capacity and conditions while trying to incorporate mindful and sustainable principles of access and equity into his work In his free time, he enjoys running in his neighborhood, biking to his favorite doughnut or coffeeshop, hiking peaks in the Cascades, and (attempting) rock climbing.

As an Outings Leader of the NYC team, Alma seeks to use her experiences to help demystify the outdoors to newcomers, and to plant the seed of stewardship in all participants. Above all, she will strive to use her culture and language to demonstrate that we all belong in nature, to nature, and thus share responsibility for it.

Program Coordinator Anahí Naranjo (she/her/hers) Anahí is an environmental justice advocate and oral historian born and raised in Quito, Ecuador. She immigrated to New York City in 2002. In those years, she was exposed to stark environmental injustices from living close to a toxic Superfund site and not having access to green spaces to seeing the impacts of climate change firsthand on her agrarian community in Ecuador. This drove her to pursue a B.A. in Environmental Studies from Middlebury College followed by an M.A. in Oral History from Columbia University. She has conducted various oral history projects and drives her non-profit communications work with a mission to elevate stories of BIPOC communities on the frontlines of pollution and the climate crisis.

Growing up in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, André was raised in the agriculturally-fueled and Latine-dominated community of Madera, CA. A community where working the land was the norm and recreating in nature seemed foreign to most members. Fortunately, one of André’s immigrant uncles discovered the joys of getting outdoors and shared the discovery with the family. Through several impactful family trips to the Sierra Nevada mountains and iconic Yosemite National Park, André ultimately developed a passion for conservation and restoration work. This passion led him to earn his B.S. in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology from UC Davis. Thereafter, André went on to work for several state and federal agencies, where he worked on habitat restoration and wildlife monitoring projects, including conducting amphibian surveys for Yosemite National Park and monitoring trout populations in southern California’s Santa Monica Mountains. After gaining perspective from his work experiences, André returned to school to pursue an M.S. in Natural Resources with a Watershed Management emphasis at Humboldt State University. Now residing again in the Madera/Fresno area, André serves as the San Joaquin Valley Organizer for CalWild, where he engages, informs and organizes the area’s communities to advocate for and protect public lands, including some of the outdoor places and ecosystems that inspired him. Outside of this, André coaches youth wrestling and loves to backpack, hike, rock climb, and simply observe nature’s raw beauty. As the Latino Outdoors Volunteer for Sacramento, André works towards inspiring others about the importance of protecting natural resources by sharing his knowledge of rivers, wildlife, and the different environmental services they provide for people, including clean water, clean air, and respite from everyday life. As a member of the Board, he hopes to further this effort and expand his support of LO’s mission.

Volunteer Antonio Garcia (he/him/his) Tony (he/him/his) is proud to be born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. Before realizing he was actually exploring in nature, his childhood consisted of many adventures navigating the crumbling concreted rivers of Milwaukee’s south side. Those green oases of baseball lots and city parks, were the Yosemite’s and the Yellowstone’s of his youth. With the help of so many and due to those that came before, Tony left Milwaukee to pursue higher education as a first-generation college student. But it wasn’t until much later, and a few degrees, that he realized some of his greatest learning would happen in the most unexpected places, right outside his window and back in those inconspicuous places of his youth. Although he now lives in Baltimore (working for the U.S. EPA), science/exploration in the city are still a passion for him. As a Latino Outdoors volunteer for Baltimore, Tony aims to learn from the beautiful community of this new, but somewhat familiar, place and to hopefully share some of the learning that he has received along the way.

Araceli is also excited to re-connect Angelenos with the outdoors! Outings Leader Ariel Barrios Jr. (he/him/his) Ariel (he/his/him) always had a connection with the outdoors. Although, being from the great City of Chicago, going out doors only meant sticking inside the urban city. It wasn’t until after his 20’s, when he had the opportunity to hike the Appalachian trail and go ice climbing North of Michigan, he realized what the outdoors truly meant.

Outings Leader Brenda Ramírez (she) Brenda grew up in sunny Norwalk, California. Her family didn’t go to wild spaces very often, so she found connection with nature in the little things, such as her mother’s house plants. When taking walks near a channelized riverbed she wondered how things might be different if the river was healthy and free. With this interest in environmentalism, Brenda pursued a degree at University of California Santa Barbara in Environmental Studies and Feminism. While she still takes joy in all the little things, such as birds and flowers, her main interest is in how nature connects us all. She did not always see someone who shared her identities represented as the “outdoorsy” type, so she is driven to create spaces where folks from underrepresented communities can share stories and be in community with each other and nature. From the skills she has learned as an environmental educator, she has been able to share her love for the outdoors with her family by going on hikes and even leading their first canoe adventure!  As a Latino Outdoors Outing Leader, Brenda hopes to help break down barriers to outdoor spaces and help Latinx Youth and families feel confident and welcome outdoors.

It was during her last quarter of studying Art and Community Studies at UC Santa Cruz, during an internship in the campus garden, that the long-dormant seed finally sprouted. After UCSC, Elexis worked in arts education in Los Angeles and devoted her free time to tending her growing love of the outdoors by planning camping trips, hounding for her own gear at affordable prices, hiking, and learning all she could about plants and wildlife through volunteering and community college classes.

Outings Leader Elizabeth Castro Maldonado (she/her) Elizabeth was raised in south Monterey County with her home life resembling the norms of the rural ranchos of Guanajuato, MX. From an early age, Elizabeth felt a deep connection to the natural world around her. When she looked to the outdoors everything seemed to make sense, from hearing her father say, ‘Agua es vida” during every rainfall or seeing her mother admire bird variations while cleaning up their backyard. While working summers in agricultural labor as a teen, Elizabeth was able to see over 200 sunrises between the CA Ventana Wilderness and Pinnacles National Park illuminating her drive to seek out an outdoor-driven lifestyle. Exploring Yosemite with the Migrant program mobilized Elizabeth to plan a trip for her family to Yosemite as a teen and sparked an enthusiasm to encourage others to explore the natural world around them. Now residing in Fresno, Elizabeth is a first generation graduate from Fresno State with a B.S. in Public Health. She has a passion for supporting community holistic healing, health awareness, shared joy, and resiliency building for disadvantaged communities.

As an Outings leader for Latino Outdoors, Elizabeth’s purpose is to foster community, joy, a sense of safety and belonging, resiliency, as well as a deeper connection with the outdoors. She has felt how intimidating outdoor recreation can be due to lack of exposure and a lack of visibility, so she strives to foster a sense of safety, empowerment, and confidence for others to feel that they belong in all places. In her free time, she enjoys storytelling, kayaking, hiking, yoga, picnicking, and rock climbing, as well as always looking for an excuse to explore any outdoor activity. Elizabeth believes it is important to share ideas, life experiences, and convivir with others.

She grew up with MacKerricher State Park as her backyard. Bouldering on cliff faces, examining tide pools, barking back at the sea lions were all par for the course for this salt girl. It was not until she was grown that Elizabeth gained a new perspective: not everyone has access to the outdoors. She began volunteering as a docent for the Noyo Center for Marine Science ready to find new coves, new groves, and new experiences. More so she wishes to share these adventures with others. As a Latino Outdoors Outings Leader for the North Coast Chapter, Elizabeth hopes to be a resource to her community so that they can experience the natural beauty of the Mendocino Coast.

Elizabeth remembers running through the corn fields, chasing frogs near the river, and helping her uncle milk cows. Every visit to the ranch was filled with unforgettable memories that taught her about our Madre Tierra. Elizabeth learned how mother earth provides an abundance of food, medicine and livelihood to those who nurture and protect her. Later in life Elizabeth attended the University of California, Riverside, where she earned her bachelor’s degree and then went on to graduate school to earn her Master’s of Arts in Special Education. Elizabeth’s most notable experience came from her study abroad experience while attending UCR in Spain. This opportunity strengthened her bond with nature allowing her to explore various countries and their diverse landscapes.

Outings Leader Francisco Villa (he/him) Growing up Latino means many things in the United States. For Francisco, it was growing up in an underprivileged neighborhood in WA State with a shortfall of resources to get outside. He was always curious about skiing and snowboarding, especially because the mountains were not that far away. Instead, his family would always discourage him with, “Mijo, ese deporte es caro y no es para nosotros.” Francisco’s luck changed when he went to Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA. It was the perfect storm for someone wanting to get outside. Gonzaga provided the resources, friends, and encouragement to get students outside. Before Francisco knew it, he was skipping class to mountain bike, ditching homework to ski at night, and spending his grocery money on bike parts. The best part of his college community was his friends, who also got outside. Through his friend David and others, he learned to rock climb, ski, mountain bike, and explore all other sorts of adventures. He then became a Student Outdoor Guide at Gonzaga Outdoors. The leadership and outdoor education were now commencing. There was also something else he started to notice that needed addressing. None of the other outdoorsy people at school looked like him. Most students who got outside were coming from upper-middle-class demographics. He knew that the outdoors needed some coloring. Francisco left college knowing that his main passion is to be outside and stay active. He also wanted to finesse his outdoor skills by continuing his outdoor education. Through the Mazamas in Portland, OR, Francisco achieved these goals and even became an educator for the Mazamas. Although, there was still something missing from all of this. His initiatives to bring diversity to the organization were not enough. It was time for him to do something drastic about it. Francisco left the Mazamas after 7 years of teaching mountaineering, ice climbing, rock climbing, and backcountry skiing. Now, as a Latino Outdoors volunteer for Portland, OR, Francisco will use his 12 years of outdoor education and experience to help and encourage the BIPOC community to get outside. He wants to help bridge the gap for other BIPOC folks who want to get outside by creating a safe and welcoming environment.

PNW is a place where he now officially calls home. Volunteer Gabriela Hydle I grew up in Guatemala City, Guatemala, never quite expecting how my life would be transformed later on. I was a city girl through and through and never wanted to leave my country. The city-girl in me followed me for years, even after I married and moved to Los Angeles, but after having our son we moved to Colorado which changed things dramatically for me! While my husband and I enjoyed camping and backpacking in California the mountains were far so trips only happened a few times a year. In Colorado, everything we wanted was close so we were outdoors all the time! I started hanging out with herbalists and surrounded myself with people who were always outdoors. At first, the winters were a little difficult but over time I even learned to enjoy the snow! Two years ago I decided to enroll in a Latina women’s mountain bike group run by COMBA. I was always a bit intimidated by biking as it wasn’t something I grew up with. My husband had tried getting me to go biking through the years but I continued to find it intimidating. This COMBA group changed my life! Riding with other Spanish speaking women not only inspired me, but it made me love the sport! I began riding any chance I got and taking every class offered. I have now raced cross-country and have begun downhill mountain biking. This transformation did not stop with mountain biking as the things I have learned have inspired me in other areas of my life. This year, I even plan to begin skiing/snowboarding which is something I had never considered until a bike took me on a chairlift! Overall, I cant believe how much these amazing people and amazing programs have helped me and now I aspire to return the favor and help other people as well.

Instead of the beach, it became walks around the neighborhood, biking, or visiting the park. Later, in college, Isabel studied Studio Arts, pulling inspiration from those childhood experiences. But it wasn’t until senior year, during a research experience in Vermont, that her love for the outdoors really flourished. She spent the summer with new friends, exploring lakes, hiking trails, and immersing herself in the nature that Vermont had to offer.

He currently works for an environmental nonprofit focused on accelerating clean energy solutions to the climate crisis. As a Latino Outdoors Program Coordinator for Portland, OR, Juan will take Latino youth into the outdoors to ensure they understand that these spaces are for them and can be cared for by them. Program Coordinator Juan Ramírez (he/him/his) Juan Ramirez was born and raised in Salinas, CA. Juan grew up visiting la familia en Mexico every winter break where he has fond memories of being connected to land and people. Whether he was helping herd farm animals on his donkey or being in the potrero with his family, he was always aware of the gifts the land gave him and his family. His parents’ experience being farmworkers shaped the kind of relationship he wanted to have with the land. He found the redwood forest being that place that gave him the embrace he needed. Since then, Juan and his family visit the redwoods as a place to connect with each other and the land. Juan stayed local and attended California State University Monterey Bay where his work with service learning led him to education. Now, Juan is the Outreach Coordinator for the Elkhorn Slough Foundation where he is bringing programming that focuses on creating healing relationships with nature and all program participants. Volunteering as a program coordinator on California’s central coast, Juan will share LO’s different offerings with local families and help the LO Central Coast team with logistics. Juan hopes to collaborate with others and create more access for families in the outdoors.

As a Latina Outdoors Volunteer for the Boston chapter, she hopes to spread and share her passion for outdoor activities in a safe and welcoming environment –it has been challenging for her to feel welcomed in groups and clubs that lack diversity and representation.  It is a goal that is close to her heart to contribute to the much-needed inclusion and accessibility of these types of spaces for the Latino community. At the same time, she hopes to foster a culture of caring for and advocating for our mother nature. Program Coordinator Julie Pasión (she/her/ella) Julie is a Mexican-Filipino first-generation immigrant, born and raised in Baltimore, MD.

Volunteer Karen Rodas Méndez (she/they/ella/elle) Karen (She/They/ Ella / Elle ) was born and raised in San Rafael, CA. As a child, her parents would take her on walks on the local bay trail and to the park near their apartment, sparking a love and interest in the outdoors. But what solidified her interest in nature was attending an overnight backpacking camp near Mount Whitney, introducing her to a whole new world of outdoors and how one can participate in it. Currently, she still lives in San Rafael and attends the College of Marin, where she is studying Environmental Science. As a Latino Outdoors Volunteer for San Francisco Bay Area, Karen will act as bridge to connect and explore together with Latine families and college students alike to the outdoors and the many fun recreational activities it has to offer. Volunteer Karina Juarez (she/her/they/them) Karina (she/her, they/them) was born and raised in Orange County, CA with familial roots in Oaxaca, Mexico. While growing up in a suburban city, her parents played a role in staying connected to nature through bike rides in local parks and plant identification on their neighborhood walks. Her early childhood visits to Oaxaca nurtured the process of reconnecting to her indigenous roots and also fostered her curiosity for the natural world. Running around her family’s pueblo , immersed in nature and being around animals, gave her a sense of autonomy and life experience not found in the suburbs. Karina recently graduated from Cal Poly Humboldt (Wiyot Land) with a double major in Fine Arts and Art Education. She has been able to fully immerse herself in the local community and further explore creation through a contemporary lens rooted in colonial resistance.

She will bring her cultural perspective to the trails, helping to create a more inclusive environment. Through her involvement, she will gain new experiences by connecting with local community members, making her community presence known, and advocating for greater visibility for diverse groups in outdoor activities. Her efforts will also emphasize the importance of gathering and fostering a sense of belonging while bridging the arts with outdoor experiences, thereby enriching the community’s connection to nature and culture.

Outings Leader Laura Menendez Navia (she/her/ella) Laura (she/her/ ella ) was born and raised in Portoviejo, Ecuador. Her first precious memories of the outdoors were vacations with her family to the beach where she would build sand castles and learned how to dive under the waves with her brothers. Growing up, Laura would spend most weekends visiting her grandparents at their finca (farm), where she would swim in the river by their house and see her grandfather and uncle harvest fruit from coconut, plantain and cacao trees. Immigrating to California was a huge transition for Laura. The language, the fast-paced lifestyle, and mostly everything at first was a cultural shock for her. It was through outings to Sequoia National Park, Monterey, and other coastal cities that she found peace and a connection to her roots that made coming to the United States feel more like home. As a Latino Outdoors volunteer Laura wants to engage others in the Latino community to explore the outdoors and experience the healing that nature and community can bring into our lives. Outings Leader Laura Monsreal Sabido (she/hers/they) Laura Monsreal Sabido (she/hers/they) was born in Merida, Yucatan, and raised in the Southwest side of Chicago, since the age of 5. As an immigrant, Laura understands the first hand struggles in the Latinx community. Laura’s introduction to the outdoors came from her relationship with her dad. As a boy scout in Yucatan, Laura’s papá has shared his passion for plants, animals and the outdoors with her. Laura remembers when her dad would take her and her sisters to the forest preserves. Over time Laura developed her love for the outdoors through gardening programs, going to the beach, and learning about indigenous communities. Meeting her chosen family in Latino Outdoors was not a coincidence. Laura is a proud member of the communication team for Latino Outdoors in the Great Lakes area. The outdoors has been a space where Laura has been able to de-stress, reflect, and build community. Laura strives to create inclusive and safe spaces for beginner adventurers, to increase representation of BIPOC folks, and to make the outdoors accessible for everyone. As an educator working in the Little Village and North Lawndale community, Laura is passionate about youth work, community, the environment, and arts. When Laura isn’t rock climbing you will find her channeling her inner warrior through weight training, running, yoga and dancing!

Outings Leader Lily Calderón (she/her/ella) Hija de inmigrantes , Lily’s parents set their roots in the city of Chicago where she was born and raised. While her parents and siblings still live in the Windy City, Lily finds herself far from her childhood home, currently living in the Pacific Northwest. Growing up in Chicago, natural areas were challenging to access. The times Lily’s family did spend outdoors, she fondly remembers her dad’s wonderful ability to connect his Native Mexico to the wildlife around him. His enthusiasm for nature sparked her own admiration for the environment. It wasn’t until Lily was an undergrad, though, that she formally learned about outdoor recreation and public lands. Her passion for the outdoors has since exploded. Lily earned her master’s in 2020 with a degree in Wildlife Ecology studying bird migration at the University of Delaware. She is an avid bird watcher and an ardent advocate for diversifying the outdoors. In her current position as a Wildlife Biologist for the US Fish and Wildlife Service and as a Latino Outdoors Outings Leader for Portland, OR, Lily strives to create and support opportunities for Latinx and other BIPOC communities to enjoy nature and find healing in these wonderful places. Outings Leader Liz Cruz (she/her) Liz has fond memories of summers spent in the country at her abuela’s house with her cousins. Many hours were spent hunting for Daddy Long Leg spiders, picking fallen pecans, and daring each other to lick the salt blocks that were meant for the cows. Each day ended with a hose off before being let back inside. The highlight of the days were the “picnics” that her abuela would prepare for them where bean and cheese tacos were always on the menu. Liz has worked in the medical field since she was 18 years old and is driven by her passion to help others. She spent many years working in the pediatric sector and has had the opportunity to work in multiple specialties and subspecialty service lines. In each role, Liz naturally fell into the role of advocating for her patients and families she met. Liz currently is the Director of Administrative Operations for Central Texas Cancer Centers. Liz is a native Austinite, and she discovered her love for the outdoors later in life. On the weekends she enjoys discovering new hiking trails and visiting Texas State Parks. She enjoys introducing others to the outdoors as well. Liz enjoys spending time with her husband, two children, their significant others, and her multiple fur babies.

As a Latino Outdoors Program Coordinator for the Great Lakes region, Liz hopes to create more opportunities and a safe space for others that are also passionate about the outdoors. Program Coordinator Liz López (she/her) Liz was born and raised north of Sacramento. Her love for the outdoors was ignited as a child, taking nature walks with her dad in their suburban neighborhood. As a former landscaper, he knew and would point out all the ornamental trees and plant names. Identification of plants and animals became a fascination for this budding biologist. In high school, Liz took her first real weekend hike. The concept of driving somewhere else just to be outside was strange and new to her, but it completely changed how she looked at the possibilities for outdoor recreation. Since then, Liz has discovered many more ways to enjoy the outdoors – her favorites include gardening, hiking, running, and kayaking – and has merged her passion and career, earning a Masters in Marine Science. She currently lives in Sacramento and works her dream job as a wildlife biologist. As a Latinx Outdoors Outings Leader for Sacramento, Liz will encourage others to see the beauty and miracle of nature all around us, whether it be in an urban or natural setting. She hopes to foster a safe space for our Latinx community, where people can come as they are and build their own unique connection with nature. Fun fact about Liz: she’s also a dancer! Program Coordinator Lucy Delgado (she/her/hers) Lucy (she/her/hers/ ella ) was born in the Dominican Republic and raised in New York City. As an immigrant kid, summers were spent in the Dominican Republic relishing any chance to be at the beach with family to eat fried fish and tostones. These are often not the immediate memories that come up when thinking about the journey to the outdoors and working to reclaim that there is no one version of the outdoors but many ways it shows up. When in NYC, there was not the same ready access to nature but that didn’t mean there was not an adventurous Sagittarius spirit in Lucy that enjoyed concrete playgrounds and Central Park. Throughout college, Lucy studied International Studies and Anthropology which allowed her passion for people and the world around her to grow. It wasn’t until graduate school in Colorado that Lucy was first introduced to one of her outdoors loves-hiking. Living in Colorado and being surrounded by the Rocky Mountains sparked a passion for hiking that is now integral to Lucy’s life. During that time, Lucy and her partner adopted their favorite hiking buddy-their dog, Mateo. Other outdoor loves are camping (especially a colorful and smoky campfire!) and kayaking, even though we won’t talk about how Lucy doesn’t know how to swim but loves all things water. As a Program Coordinator for the LO Baltimore team, Lucy aspires to continue learning more about environmental justice causes that inherently impact marginalized communities. The joy and return to self brought on by hiking have made Lucy want to invite others to join her and reimagine the narrative of who is outdoorsy. Outings Leader Luz González Luz has been a lover of the outdoors since when she was a little girl.

His parents are from Sinaloa and Jalisco. He was born and raised in Orange County, then lived in the Inland Empire and now resides in San Diego – southern Cali all his life. Manuel developed a love for the outdoors as a kid on a skateboard — the urban outdoors. Then, at about 18 he went on his first hike and it completely changed his life. The special bond and camaraderie developed from struggling up Mt. Wilson in LA with his older cousin in a wilderness space completely revolutionized his desire to be outdoors: and his love for el monte sprouted. Now, he is eager to share his love and passion for the outdoors. As a Latino Outdoors Outings Leader for San Diego, Manuel will encourage and empower other Latin@s to discover and share a similar passion for the outdoors, whether it be a wilderness or urban space.

Her earliest memories of outdoor recreation are family trips to Kings Canyon National Park to play in the snow and swimming at the nearby Aguacate (Avocado Lake). More recently, Maria has been fortunate to travel more frequently and has visited State and National Parks throughout California, Nevada, and Utah.

Outings Leader María Belén Luzuriaga Abad María Belén Luzuriaga Abad was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. She moved to the US at age 12. When María Belén first moved to the US she didn’t have a chance to connect with other individuals that had her path; most immigration topics were very taboo. Going outdoors was not encouraged because her parents did not know this country or knew anyone to guide them through the outdoors. This is why she believes in the mission of Latino Outdoors and being able to share what she has learned with others to enhance their outdoor experience. Her passions for performing and composing music helps her mind expand and create inwardly, while traveling guides her to explore the outside world and connect with people from different cultures. Sometimes she travels for work as an audio-visual technician, and that has taught her to absorb information about how technology is connecting us in the world. She’s also an Ayurvedic counselor and LMP, those practices have led María Belén to connect with nature and others in mind & body. Her love for nature grows rapidly with outdoor adventures like hiking, foraging, kayaking, exploring different continents, and more. Lastly, María Belén enjoys teaching music & art workshops to kids. She says “it has been a beautiful journey across the color palette of how uniquely our minds are shaped by personal experiences in this life.” Outings Leader Maria Gallegos (she/her) Maria was born in Degollado, Jalisco.

While growing up in Fresno, CA, her connection to the outdoors included playing in the lush grape fields of the countryside and going to Roeding Park for the staple family carne asadas on the weekends. Although Fresno is known for being surrounded by many natural wonders like Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, her family did not have many opportunities to partake in those spaces. It wasn’t until her late twenties when she started finding her own path into those awe-inspiring environments. Her airline career has given her the opportunity to travel to ten beautiful countries. Taking in the vast environments and cultures during her travels gave her a glimpse of what the world had to offer. She started seeking out other opportunities and groups that would help educate and nurture a sense of belonging. She was able go find that connection with Latino Outdoors. Thanks to Latino Outdoors she was able to experience her first camping trip at the age of 35 and was introduced to rock climbing, her new favorite sport. Latino Outdoors gave her the opportunity to meet like-minded individuals that shared her story and a sense of belonging to all outdoor spaces. As a Latino Outdoors volunteer for Fresno, May hopes to help others feel a sense of connection and belonging to outdoor spaces, by supporting and making LO events memorable. She also wants to encourage others to share their own stories and advocate, it’s never too late to start your own journey.

Volunteer Monica Vega Latona (they/them) Monica Vega Latona (they/them) is Tejana/Californian/Xicana currently living in Sacramento, California. Some of their earliest and most significant outdoor memories are of their grandmother’s house in El Paso where the Franklin Mountains rise from the desert, monuments to the dreams of their migrant ancestors. They grew up with a very complicated message about the outdoors: “only rich people take vacation”, “we don’t go camping” and “we don’t go outside,” were messages they received from family. However, their family was always outside at a BBQ, driving through the desert, or starting a garden. Later, Monica found a love of exploring tide pools and California redwoods on a trip with their marine biology class in community college. Since then, Monica has chased sunsets at golden hour on hikes along the west coast, finding healing through writing and painting in the outdoors. They currently have a Masters in Library and Information Science from San José State University and a B.A. from Sacramento State University in Art with a minor in Latinx/Chicanx Studies.

Nancy grew up playing in the patio and local parks, sometimes her family would pack up and go to the LA mountains to visit el rio in the summer, and in the winter her family would drive up to la nieve in the San Bernardino mountains. Nancy wasn’t particularly fond of nature growing up, she didn’t like being dirty and was terrified of bees. Fast forward after high school, she decided she wanted to move away for college, the idea of exploring the world on her own excited her. She didn’t have a plan, she was planning on becoming a doctor, so she can make some money and help her parents out. She landed at California State University, Monterey Bay where there is an immense amount of natural beauty. Over the first two years of college, she met friends who would take her out to the woods and she didn’t quite understand why they wanted to be there all the time but she went. Time passed and she noticed the stars, the details in shrubs, the smells, the feeling of wandering in nature, the peace. She has learned so much while immersed in nature, has gone through huge epiphanies and worked through life lessons. When she was sad or heartbroken, she’d go to the woods and come back clear. She changed her major to Environmental Studies and was interested in the relationship between people and nature. Throughout and after college, she worked as a student assistant for Return of the Natives, a non-profit that focused on nature connection and habitat restoration. A lot of the time she was sharing her love of nature with youth. She continued work in outdoor education, fell in love, had a beautiful baby girl and now, she is the Education Programs Coordinator for that same non-profit: Habitat Stewardship Project, Monterey Bay (formerly, Return of the Natives).

Outings Leader Ruby Aguirre-Gutiérrez (ella/she/her) Ruby and her family immigrated from Nayarit, Mexico to Merced, CA where she spent the rest of developing years navigating the public school system and adjusting to the experience of being first generation. One of Ruby’s foundational experience in settling into a new country was visiting Yosemite National Park regularly. Living so close to a national park was a privilege and while also facing social and environmental disparities in her community, this did not stop Ruby from accessing nature, because she does not believe it should be a privilege to have access to clean air and the natural environment.

Editor’s Note Mainstreet Daily News, in a collaboration with Noel Leroux, founder of Gainesville Downtown , is spotlighting downtown businesses to learn how each one is coping with the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation. Become A Member Mainstreet does not have a paywall, but pavement-pounding journalism is not free. Join your neighbors who make this vital work possible. See Member Benefits April is usually the busiest month of the year at Boca Fiesta , the Mexican-inspired restaurant next door to the Hippodrome Theatre. And with Cinco de Mayo and graduation just around the corner, business should be booming for co-owners Warren Oakes and Jacob Ihde. The coronavirus, however, has brought orders of quesadillas and burritos — not to mention margaritas and other libations — to almost a screeching halt. “We have good days and we have slow days,” Ihde told gainesvilledowntown.com. Oakes nodded and added: “We’re taking it one day at a time.” Although the two men closed their restaurant to spend Easter with their families, Boca Fiesta is open daily from 4-9 p.m. for takeout and delivery with a “limited edition” menu. Order ahead by calling 352.336.TACO (8226) . A staff member will bring the order to you outside the restaurant at 232 SE 1st St. (The front entrance faces the courtyard on the west side of the Hippodrome.) To order online, click on the delivery/pickup link at bocafiesta.com during business hours. Delivery is free when ordered through the restaurant. Oakes had to excuse himself on Saturday to deliver an order to his mother and sister! In addition to food and beverages, Oakes and Ihde also would have live music and other events in The Backyard entertainment venue between Boca Fiesta and Palomino Pool Hall. The Backyard is shut down. “We had so many things on our calendar that just got wiped out,” Oakes said. “You can’t deliver karaoke night or trivia night to someone’s house.” At least Oakes and Ihde are still in business. Next door at Palomino, the pool tables have been silent for almost a month. To help pay employees, Palomino owners Jeff McMullen and Mitchell Eadens are encouraging patrons to purchase special T-shirts through their Palomino Pool Hall Facebook page. The three establishments had to let go more than 70 employees during the past month. At Boca Fiesta, all tips received are going into a fund for out-of-work employees. “I feel terrible people are not getting their regular paychecks,” Ihde said. “Something coming in is better than nothing coming in,” Oakes said. Boca Fiesta will mark its 11th anniversary on June 1, hopefully with a fiesta. Oakes said he misses the crowds that his restaurant attracted. “I just attended my first video birthday party,” he said. “You lose something in the translation.” About the Author Noel Leroux is the publisher of gainesvilledowntown.com , a website dedicated to covering all things downtown.
