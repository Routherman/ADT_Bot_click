How do I know which class is easy or hard? Have no fear...we are fun art, not fine art! Every class is geared towards beginning painters and our team of awesome artists will help you recreate a beautiful painting with step-by-step instructions in a happy, fun place. No experience or skills are required. What should I expect? A fun time! Every class has a different personality and we can never predict how loud or quiet the experience will be. Whether a crowded weekend class with lots of parties or a smaller weekday paint session, you are sure to have a great time. This is where adults come to uncork the fun! What should I bring? - Your ID to prove you're over 21 years of age. Expect to get carded even if you're well over 21 years of age! If we cannot verify your age, you will be turned away. - If you're worried about getting paint on your fancy clothes or designer purse, please leave them at home so you don't have to worry about it. It's best to be prepared for the occasional \"happy little accident\" of a paint or wine spill. Can you save my spot until I pay at the studio instead? All seats must be paid for no later than 30 minutes prior to start of event. The studio needs to know you're coming so we can prepare your seat, supplies, and any seating requests. If you cannot pay online, please be at the studio 30-minutes early to pay for your seat. We will do our best, but cannot always guarantee walk-in reservations. Can I come by myself or do I have to be in a group or party? Of course you can come by yourself! Let us know if you're just wanting some \"me\" time, or if you want to meet new people and mingle! This is also a fun and safe place to meet a new date, or get together with old friends. I didn't get a confirmation email. Am I registered? Please call or email our studio to confirm your reservation if you did not receive a confirmation. It's likely the result of a typo and we can easily correct your information and resend the confirmation. Do you do reserved seating? Yes, please note all members of your party that you would like to sit with when you make your reservation. Can my friends come and watch us without painting? No, everyone must have a paid seat to stay on premises during all classes. There was a class on the calendar and now the painting is different. What happened to the original painting? Paintings are often changed if there is no interest in the class. The only way we know someone is interested in a painting is if they sign up. If you see something you like, please reserve early otherwise you run the risk of the painting being changed. Will my painting be dry by the end of the night? Yes, if there are a few damp places we have hair dryers that will dry them quickly. CHILDREN & FAMILY EVENTS Do you ever have children's events in the studio? Can kids attend with an adult? - Due to the sale of beer and wine in the studio, no persons under the age of 21 are permitted in the studio at any time.
