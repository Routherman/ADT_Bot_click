Capital gifts of all sizes provide for new gardens and facilities, while endowment gifts ensure that our new gardens mature and are nurtured for future generations to enjoy. Growing our Garden In 1994 a visionary group of local plant enthusiasts founded the Garden. Through the extraordinary generosity and vision of Harvey Kapnick, Jr., the Garden was able to purchase 170 acres of open space made up of seven natural habitats in 2000. Today Naples Botanical Garden features gardens designed by some of the world’s great tropical landscape architects. Visitors of all ages find inspiration in our many gardens, our feature exhibits, and our educational programs. The Garden has become one of the most important destinations in Southwest Florida thanks to the generous individuals and families who made an investment through a capital gift to transform a vision into a reality. Plans are taking shape that will guide the growth of the Garden through its next phase of development. Capital gifts will continue to sustain this effort. For more information about current capital projects and naming opportunities, please contact Rhea Merrill, Director of Development, at 239.571.3806 or rmerrill@naplesgarden.org . Funding our Future A gift to the Garden’s Endowment ensures the upkeep, growth, and care of Naples Botanical Garden for future generations to enjoy. Today, revenue from memberships, gifts to the annual fund, other generous donations, and grants combined with earned revenue provide for the day-to-day operations of the Garden. As we make plans for new gardens, future facilities, and expanding programs, the Garden’s Endowment Fund will add an additional and permanent revenue stream to help sustain and strengthen the Garden well into the future to ensure long-term financial health. Currently, the Garden’s Endowment Fund is around $3 million. In order to sustain the Garden into the future, this fund will need to grow to at least $10 million. Gifts of all sizes truly make a difference. To find out more about making an endowed gift now or through a planned gift, please contact Rhea Merrill, Director of Development, at 239.571.3806 or rmerrill@naplesgarden.org . Many naming opportunities are available! Please note that as we are a public garden, commemorative materials such as flowers, balloons, and stuffed animals are not allowed in the Garden at any time.

Custom designed for Naples Botanical Garden, the campus will allow for the enhancement of the Garden’s 170 acres, the development of nature-based solutions to environmental challenges, and the conservation of tropical and subtropical plants. This includes native species threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and natural disasters. With more than 60,000 square feet of growing space, the campus features specialized environmental controls that allow our staff to replicate natural conditions and care for even the most sensitive of plants. This center will drive the Garden’s mission for decades to come! Donate to the Evenstad Horticulture Campus Plant Collections Laboratories will support Garden conservationists in discovering how to store and grow the seeds of Southwest Florida’s native plants. Their efforts ensure the availability of plants for restoration and safeguard the species we have today in light of an uncertain tomorrow. Nature-Based Solutions The Garden studies coastal ecosystems and advises local governments on how to restore beach dunes — the first line of defense against wind and surge. Likewise, the Garden investigates the use of plants to purify stormwater runoff. New research and nursery space will expand these critical efforts. Horticultural Excellence From potting sheds to sun nurseries, horticulturists can nurture plants through every stage of their development. By growing more plants in-house, our team can ensure specimens meet the highest standards for beauty and longevity. Advanced growing facilities will entice serious plant collectors and fellow botanical gardens to share their most precious holdings — and we’ll do the same as we expand our collections. The campus will deepen the Garden’s study of the trees, shrubs, and groundcovers best suited for Southwest Florida’s unique climate and growing conditions. The research allows us to advise local governments and industry professionals on environmentally friendly, resilient landscapes.
