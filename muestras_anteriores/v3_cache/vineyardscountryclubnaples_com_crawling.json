This landmark destination offers a rich history and longstanding reputation for integrity, exceptional service and compassion. One of the largest country clubs in Naples, Vineyards has earned numerous awards and accolades for its dedication to delivering an unmatched, timeless experience for golf, wellness, fine dining, social events and more. Both residents and non-residents are welcome to enjoy the club’s resort-style amenities. This includes two award-winning, 18-hole championship golf courses set against 300-acres of verdant greens. Laying the Foundation for a True Legacy Vineyards Country Club began as the dream of two brothers and successful businessmen, Joseph and Michael Procacci. After growing their family’s tomato business into one of the largest wholesale produce distributors in the world, the Procacci brothers founded the Vineyards Development Corporation with the vision of creating a community of lasting integrity in North Naples. As a result, the country club provided buyers with greater value from the start. More than three decades later, Vineyards Country Club remains debt-free, competitive and stable, offering a sustainable legacy that many local clubs simply cannot match. BECOME A MEMBER AT VINEYARDS COUNTRY CLUB! EXPLORE MEMBERSHIP Vineyards Country Club Awards & Accolades As a debt-free club, members do not pay assessments. The strong ownership of the Procacci family has ensured that Vineyards Country Club will maintain its legacy of stability and luxury for generations to come. Creating a community of lasting integrity inspired Vineyard’s creators to invest heavily in the community’s central feature, its award-winning country club. Vineyards Development Corp. broke ground on the country club in October 1986, with its completion in January 1988. One of the largest country clubs in Naples, more than 300 acres were dedicated to the club’s grounds and its clubhouse is a spacious 70,000 square feet. To keep the club fresh and competitive at the highest level, Vineyards Country Club has continued to expand and enhance its facilities over the years. Since its original construction, the club has completed three renovations. During its 30th year, the clubhouse received a total renovation and brand-new 15,000 square-foot state-of-the-art Wellness Center & Spa, delivering exceptional amenities and service to Vineyards members and their guests. 5X CONSECUTIVE WINNER PEOPLE’S CHOICE AWARD FOR BEST COUNTRY CLUB Naples Daily News WINNER SAND DOLLAR AWARD FOR THE WELLNESS CENTER & SPA Collier Building Industry Association WINNER FINALIST FOR BEST GOLF COURSE AND PICKLEBALL FACILITY Gulfshore Life Best of the Gulfshore WINNER GOLDEN PALM AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE South Florida Hospitality Industry Network HONOREE AND MEMBER AMERICA’ S HEALTHIEST CLUBS Prevo Health Solutions Industry Association PROJECT PARTNER BLUE ZONES PROJECT COMMUNITY Blue Zones Project® SILVER ADDY WINNER CONSUMER WEBSITE American Advertising Awards What People Say About Vineyards Country Club This place is gorgeous! What a beautiful remodel here at the club. We just went to Italian night, perfectly prepared shells, pasta bar, salmon, grilled veg., and the best service. - Deb M. ‘Membership in the Vineyards Country Club is like being on a Cruise Ship. There’s a choice of dining options from, fine dining to informal Dining and a Pub with an impressive menu and many craft beers, as well as pool-side casual dining. There is an Activities Director with similar responsibilities to a Cruise Director and there are always a wide variety of exciting activities. Two tournament quality golf courses, twelve tennis courts and three Bocce courts are just some of the sports activities and the Fitness Center is one of the finest available anywhere. In the unlikely event there is an activity you're interested in that isn't scheduled, it will be if there are a few others who share your interest.’ - William S. ‘Vineyards is a high-class country club with two beautiful golf courses’ - Barry B. My wife and I played The Vineyards last week, it was AWESOME. Everyone from the bag drop area, the pro shop, bar,  restaurant and the cart girl. The course was in great condition. The workers on the course would stop, turn down their machines while you played your shot. This is the place to go join if you want to be a member of a beautiful Country Club it has everything. You need to check this club out before you join anywhere. This was the highlight of our stay in Naples. - Perry K. The new Wellness Center & spa is state-of-the-art. It’s large and it’s personal at the same time. The staff make you always feel welcome. I’m a tennis player, and the tennis staff at the club are professional personable and simply the best. There’s a common thread throughout this club, quality, value and always creating a positive member experience. - Mark M. Their tennis pro shop has a great selection of tennis/pickleball items.

Are you dreaming of a wedding that encapsulates classic charm and sophistication? Planning a wedding is no small feat, and for many, the ultimate venue choice can set the tone for the entire celebration. Country clubs offer a unique blend of picturesque landscapes, luxurious amenities, and impeccable service, making them a preferred choice for couples seeking a timeless experience. With sprawling grounds and elegant ballrooms, these venues have the ability to transform your wedding into the fairy tale you’ve always envisioned. Join us as we explore the key elements to consider, ensuring that your country club wedding not only meets but exceeds all your expectations for a truly unforgettable celebration. Exquisite Indoor and Outdoor Venues For many, a country club that offers both indoor and outdoor wedding venues presents a variety of compelling benefits. This flexibility not only enhances the experience for the couple and their guests but also ensures that the wedding day runs smoothly. Having both indoor and outdoor spaces allows couples to accommodate their guest list comfortably. An outdoor lawn can serve as an ideal space for larger gatherings, while the indoor venue offers a more intimate setting for smaller weddings. The juxtaposition of indoor and outdoor settings provides diverse backdrops for wedding photography. Couples can take advantage of beautifully landscaped outdoor areas as well as the elegant interiors of the country club, resulting in a stunning array of photographs that capture the day’s memories from multiple perspectives. Personalized Timeless Details A country club wedding offers a perfect backdrop for a blend of elegance, sophistication, and personal touches that reflect the couple’s unique style and story. Incorporating personalized timeless details into your wedding will not only enhance the aesthetic but also create a memorable experience for you and your guests. Custom Invitations and Stationery Begin with custom-designed invitations that reflect the theme and color palette of your wedding. Work with a designer to incorporate personalized motifs, such as monograms or illustrations of the country club venue. Consider including the following details: Timeline and location : Provide a small itinerary or map of the country club layout to give guests a sense of familiarity. Personal Touch : Add a handwritten note or a custom wax seal to make your invitations stand out. Custom Decor Incorporate elements that hold special meaning, such as: Family Heirlooms : Use vintage vases or candle holders passed down through generations. Photos of You : Display framed photographs from your journey together or of family members on their wedding days. Consider personalized place cards and menu cards. Use a sophisticated font and layout to maintain an elegant tone that fits the country club venue. Incorporate Family Traditions If you and your partner come from different cultural backgrounds, blend traditions into the ceremony and reception . This showcases your individual stories while fostering a sense of unity. Incorporate music, dances, or readings that have significance in your families, making it a celebratory blend of love and heritage. Elegant Send-Off Conclude your special day with a personalized send-off—a sparkler exit, a vintage car, or a horse-drawn carriage. Ensure that it reflects your personal style and leaves a lasting impression on your guests. As guests leave, hand them thoughtful thank-you cards or keepsakes to remember your union. How to Ensure Flawless Ambiance Embrace Venue’s Natural Beauty: Many country clubs boast breathtaking landscapes. Position your ceremony and reception to highlight these stunning views. Whether it’s a lakeside setting or manicured gardens, nature can provide an elegant backdrop. Harmonious Color Palette: Pick a color scheme that complements the venue’s decor. Soft pastels or classic shades like navy and gold can add a touch of sophistication without overpowering the natural beauty of the surroundings. Use flowers, linens, and table settings that align with your color palette. Aligning these elements will create a cohesive atmosphere throughout the celebration. Soft Lighting and Candles: Incorporate soft, warm lighting to create a romantic ambiance. Options like string lights, lanterns, or chandeliers can transform your space into a magical environment. Candles can add warmth and intimacy, especially for an evening wedding. Consider tea lights or pillar candles on tables, along staircases, and near focal points. Curate Your Sound: Select a mix of live music and a DJ that complements the mood you want to create. Start with softer tunes during the cocktail hour, transitioning into more upbeat songs for dancing later. If your country club is near water or surrounded by trees, take advantage of these natural sounds. They can enhance the tranquil feel of the setting, drawing guests into your environment. Coordinate with a Professional: A wedding planner experienced in country club weddings can help you navigate logistics and ensure everything aligns with your vision. They can be invaluable in managing vendors, timelines, and ambiance specifics. Stay in close contact with the country club’s event staff to ensure all your needs are met. They can offer suggestions on lighting, setup, and catering that can enhance your ambiance significantly. FAQs: Planning Your Timeless Country Club Wedding To help you navigate the process, we’ve compiled a list of frequently asked questions related to planning your country club wedding. What makes a country club an ideal wedding venue? Country clubs offer an elegant and serene atmosphere, often featuring beautiful landscaping, scenic golf courses, and well-maintained facilities. They also typically provide comprehensive services, including catering, event coordination, and accommodations, which can simplify wedding planning. How do I secure a country club for my wedding date? To secure a country club, contact their event coordinator to check availability for your desired date. Many venues book up quickly, especially during peak wedding season, so it’s advisable to reserve your date as soon as you can, paying attention to their deposit and contract policies.

Be sure to discuss your preferences with the event coordinator to create the perfect package that reflects your vision. What should we consider regarding decor?

(May 22, 2020) — In accordance with guidelines set forth in the second phase of Governor DeSantis’ Plan for Florida Recovery , Vineyards Country Club’s dining facilities, salon, spa and amenity areas are now open and available with social distancing measures both indoors and outdoors, limited indoor occupancy of no more than 50% and outdoor seating. The salon and spa, located within the community’s 15,000 square foot Wellness Center, is accepting reservations with limited available hours by appointment. “In keeping with our recent designation as one of America’s healthiest clubs through the Blue Zones Project®, we are taking every measure possible to ensure an environmentally healthy atmosphere conducive to maintaining lifelong wellness,” said Vineyards Country Club Chief Operating Officer Paul Malonson. “We’ve missed our residents and members over the last two months, and we are excited to share our newly-renovated club with everyone.” As a gesture of appreciation for Vineyards Country Club’s recent donation of more than 400 meals for its healthcare workers, NCH Healthcare System deployed its Xenex LightStrike™ Germ-Zapping™ Robot to disinfect Vineyards’ entire 70,000-square-foot clubhouse, including all kitchens, dining areas, administrative offices and lobby. The robot uses a commercial grade ultraviolet light to kill germs. According to Xenex, the LightStrike robot manufacturer, the machines destroy the COVID-19 virus in two minutes. The robot provides an additional layer of protection to complement the club’s stringent sanitation guidelines. All food and beverage staff members are exceeding Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines by wearing protective masks and gloves, cleaning and disinfecting all areas including frequently touched surfaces, especially between usages. Employees are continuously training to reinforce cleaning, sanitation and disinfection procedures. Members are strongly encouraged to call ahead for reservations. In addition to consistent reinforcement of sanitation initiatives, precautionary measures performed by the club’s management, staff and housekeeping teams include using an ionic air purifier multiple times daily to disinfect surfaces throughout the club, continuous sanitization to avoid cross-contamination, and certifying all service staff in appropriate service procedures as defined by the CDC’s COVID-19 guidelines.
