Courtyard of Burbank Aero Crossings TCA Architects Demolition of the store, which sits on an eight-acre property at 2311 Hollywood Way, will clear the way for the construction of LaTerra Development' s Burbank Aero Crossings, which was approved by the City of Burbank in 2021. Plans call for the construction of two seven-story buildings at featuring 862 residential units with 9,700 square feet of ground-floor commercial space and a central parking structure. TCA Architects is serving as the architect of record for the project, which was also approved with up to 152,000 square feet of office space. An exact timeline for the project, which was once expected to break ground in 2023, is currently unclear. 2311 N Hollywood Way - proposed site of Burbank Aero Crossing City of Burbank Aero Crossings is the second large development for LaTerra in Burbank, following a 573-unit complex located at 777 N. Front Street near the city's downtown Metrolink Station . The Fry's chain, which went out of business in 2021, left behind prime real estate at several locations in Southern California. One other has already been scooped up for redevelopment - the former Warner Center store at 6100 Canoga Avenue is set to make way for a 1.1 million-square-foot complex featuring housing and a hotel.

The creative team at RSM Design worked closely with Gensler, OJB Landscape Architecture, Taylor and Miller Design, Ludlow Kingsley, and others to completely reimagine this iconic destination. After completing an extensive analysis of the property, including wayfinding strategies, signage entitlements/inventory, flow patterns, and guest interactions, RSM Design created timeless wayfinding solutions for the complex labyrinth of interior and exterior spaces. A completely new wayfinding strategy was developed to guide visitors around the once confusing circulation paths. Additionally, the RSM Design team designed a fresh palette of brand murals and other placemaking graphics to respect the new brand character and create a sense of place that is unique to Hollywood. Markets Mixed-Use Retail Services Environmental Graphic Design Wayfinding Design Digital Integration Public Art & Murals Experiential Graphics Design Awards 2023 Creative Communication Awards Winner: Functional Typography & Wayfinding Client DJM Capital Partners Inc GAW Capital Partners Image via Hollywoodpartnership.com (Photo courtesy Marc Wannamaker/Bison Archives) A HISTORIC HOLLYWOOD LANDMARK The Hollywood Hotel stood at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland for the first half of the twentieth century. Over the years, the site has been redeveloped to accommodate a variety of attractions. In 2001, Hollywood & Highland opened as a large-scale retail destination with entertainment amenities. The destination was popular for visitors, but over time became outdated and less attractive. Now, the destination is being revitalized once again, still with retail and entertainment in mind. Ovation Hollywood is set to become the premier Hollywood spot for both tourists and locals, with a modernized and design-forward aesthetic. See more RSM Design retail work › A $100 MILLION DOLLAR MAKEOVER Ovation Hollywood is an attraction where locals, tourists, and entertainment merge. However, the retail and entertainment destination wasn’t always as sophisticated and glamorous as it is today. The $100 million dollar makeover, led by DJM and GAW Capital, included demolition of the controversial Babylonian-themed archway and oversized elephant statues. The new architecture and archway features a timeless white facade and a playful mural design by Geoff McFetridge. Now, as visitors enter the space they’re welcomed by a revamped open courtyard, lush landscape, new spaces for offices, restaurants, and retail, as well as placemaking and graphics to bring a sense of whimsy and fun. The goal for the new space was to create something that is forward-looking and welcomes Los Angeles’ diversity and optimism. A NEW BRANDED ENVIRONMENT The team at RSM Design collaborated with branding agency Ludlow Kingsley to implement environmental graphics at Ovation Hollywood. The key brand principle is celebration: of culture, diversity, and accomplishments of the Los Angeles community. Utilizing the brand guidelines, logo, and color palette, RSM Design crafted placemaking graphics and mural designs intended to invite visitors to share in the celebratory experience. WAYFINDING FOR A LOS ANGELES ATTRACTION Ovation Hollywood occupies 387,000 square-feet of property in Los Angeles. The site includes the TCL Chinese Theatre and the DolbyTheatre, home of the Academy Awards. It’s also located along the famousHollywood Walk of Fame, one of the most visited tourist destinations in Los Angeles, and features views of the Hollywood sign. For as sought-after as an attraction that Ovation Hollywood is, wayfinding plays a critical role in the guest experience. Wayfinding signage provides visitors with a clear and seamless journey from the entrance, to the parking garage, around the site, and to the exit. The goal of the wayfinding system at Ovation Hollywood is to clearly identify key destinations as well as remain true to the brand aesthetic. Wayfinding and branded touch points work to move groups of people from point A to point B in a clear and cohesive manner. In addition to offering a sense of security, wayfinding and placemaking also work to animate the brand and bring a sense of character that visitors can relate to and feel excited about.
