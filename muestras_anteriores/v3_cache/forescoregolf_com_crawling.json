Golfboard is fun, and it provides a bit of a workout for those feeling guilty about not walking. \" — Golf Digest “ If every golf course offered GolfBoards, golf would be the most popular sport in the world. ” — Stina Sternberg, Golf Digest Global Golf Director Unique Design developed  specifically for golf course use Unique Design developed  specifically for golf course use GolfBoard’s unique and proprietary features make it    best-in-class Automatic Braking Ease of use and safety is optimized by an on-board computer that monitors speed and controls braking.   The rider simply releases the thumb throttle, and the board immediately decelerates and comes to a complete stop. Then an automatic rear axle parking brake locks the board in position even on the steepest hill.  This provides you a stable structure to step off, and won't allow the GolfBoard to roll away even if you come to a stop at a tricky sidehill shot. Commercial Rental and Personal Use Options GolfBoard riders have the ability to select either high speed or low speed modes of operation. For the Commercial Use Board, low speed is a gentle 5 mph, allowing first time users the ability to practice turning and operating the board with security and confidence. Once new users have perfected their GolfBoarding skills, they can advance to a maximum speed of 10 mph. For personal use, GolfBoard offers an optional high performance package with low speed of 7 mph, and a maximum high speed of 12.5 mph on flat terrain, plus up to 14 mph down hill. This 25% to 40% increase in maximum speed also provides faster acceleration for those riders looking for a more adventuresome experience. 4 Wheel Drive Posi-Traction System GolfBoards are driven by front and rear gear boxes providing power to all four wheels. This proprietary 4 wheel Posi-Traction system provides solid climbing ability even on the steepest hills while simultaneously reducing turf wear. Intuitive Controls GolfBoards are primarily controlled using an ergonomically designed one-touch thumb throttle which allows the user to smoothly accelerate and decelerate. The throttle mechanism also features an intelligent LED battery charge level indicator.  A Hi / low speed option mounted on the Stability Bar allows the user to set their maximum speed preference, along with a forward / reverse function that provides optimal maneuverability. Industrial Strength Motors & Enclosed Drivetrain GolfBoards use the highest quality industrial grade electric motors with fully enclosed drivetrain to ensure reliability and low maintenance.  Built to handle high-power industrial applications, the GolfBoard's motors are expected to be maintenance free for several years before requiring a simple and low cost replacement. True Turf Tires The GolfBoard utilizes tires specifically made for golf course use. Produced by the world's leading manufacturer of turf equipment tires, GolfBoard's ‘gentle-on-the-turf’ tires provide maximum traction while minimizing turf wear. With the GolfBoards comparatively low weight distributed over the same surface area as much heavier equipment, there is substantially less impact and pressure on the turf than a fully loaded golf cart.

All V1.3 GolfBoards have a new powder-coated steel stability bar, plus convenient external circuit breakers for ease of servicing and storage during the off season. The V1.3 GolfBoards will consistently deliver 27 holes of usage on one charge on all but the most demanding courses, plus have improved climbing ability on steep hills or slippery terrain. Golf course operators will be able to rent their fleet of GolfBoards for an 18-hole round plus a potential second 9-hole round without any recharging, or redeploy their GolfBoards for a 2nd 18-hole round with just under 1-hour of recharging. In contrast to lead acid batteries in regular golf carts that require tedious maintenance and long recharge times, the GolfBoard’s lithium battery requires zero maintenance, last longer, and are far lighter. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Reduces Turf wear ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Reduces Turf wear The GolfBoard is     Turf Friendly Every golfer loves playing on turf that is healthy and beautifully manicured. Day in and day out Golf Course Superintendents everywhere do battle with the forces that try to undermine their ability to produce these desired pristine playing conditions. Ironically, it’s the action of the golfers themselves that frequently causes the most amount of turf damage. Foot traﬃc and golf cart wear are the greatest contributing causes of damage to fairways. Out of strict concern for minimizing injury to turf, the GolfBoard has been engineered to make the smallest possible degree of turf impact. With approximately the same PSI as a golf cart (6lbs per square inch), but only 25% of the footprint, the GolfBoard can reduce turf wear by as much as 75%. The psi of a person walking is far greater than the psi of a golf cart or a GolfBoard. But psi alone is not the main cause of turf damage, it's redundant golf cart traﬃc patterns. The GolfBoard is much smaller and more maneuverable than a golf cart, which eliminates damaging recurrent traffic patterns, which helps keep grass healthier and superintendents happier.

INCREASE REVENUE NEW REVENUE STREAMS FOR COURSE OPERATORS INCREASE REVENUE NEW REVENUE STREAMS FOR COURSE OPERATORS The GolfBoard has proven to make golf more popular and courses more profitable: Attract New Players - Golf is a game that players quickly come to love, but is largely still undiscovered by a new generation of potential life long fans. GolfBoard appeals to the younger action sports crowd looking for adventure, excitement, and fun. Increase Frequency Of Play - The avid player is GolfBoard's biggest fan. With a GolfBoard you can complete a round in half the time, so you can play twice as often. Differentiate Your Course - GolfBoarding is an entirely new sport that most every golfer is eager to try. A rental fleet of GolfBoards provides an unique new offering that will attract players from other courses and keep them coming back for more. Guest & Media Buzz - Nothing generates more media attention and positive word of mouth than a new GolfBoard program. Your members and guests will help spread the word about just how much fun they had. Increase Rounds Played - After years of declining popularity, GolfBoard has proven time and time again to put courses back on track for strong growth. Many early adopters of GolfBoard have seen over a 30% increase in rounds played. Generate More Revenue - While the overall goal of GolfBoard is help courses attract new players, plus provide their members and guests a unique new way to enjoy the game, one of the greatest benefits is to a course's bottom line. Golfers and golf course owners believe the future growth of the game will include GolfBoard.

American Music Preservation For the San Francisco Symphony Executive Director Brent Assink General Manager John Kieser Director of Artistic Planning John Mangum Media Production Manager Joyce Cron Wessling SFS Media Manager Andy Eiseman About Keeping Score Biographies In the News Products Support for Keeping Score Credits & Acknowledgements \"[The Keeping Score programs] are, hands down, the best classical-music programs of their kind to be aired nationally in the U.S. since Leonard Bernstein’s Young People’s Concerts. [Michael Tilson Thomas] is the finest American conductor of his generation, and the only one who learned the lessons of Leonard Bernstein, using them to turn the San Francisco Symphony into the most adventurous, audience-friendly orchestra in America.\" — Terry Teachout, The Wall Street Journal \"Playing music well is difficult, yet the world has an abundance of fine performers. Explaining a little about music is easier, yet few do it well. Those who can do both supremely form a tiny club, whose honorary chairman is the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas.\" — Justin Davidson, Newsday \"The MTT Files [is] an illuminating and often profound look at the way classical music informs many of the larger concerns of our day, such as who we are as Americans and who owns music.\" — Mark Swed, Los Angeles Times [MTT] has turned the San Francisco Symphony into an admirable education enterprise. The orchestra offers workshops and resources for K-12 teachers. It has produced flashy TV shows on Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Stravinsky and Copland, all out on DVD and including some fine performances, plenty of scenic travelogue shots and rapid-fire morsels of information. If all the fast cutting isn't fast enough, a website — www.keepingscore.org — provides many of the small segments for those who like to click for tidbits. – Los Angeles Times Privacy Policy | Terms of Use | SFSymphony.org | SFSkids.org | Contact Us © 2011 San Francisco Symphony.
