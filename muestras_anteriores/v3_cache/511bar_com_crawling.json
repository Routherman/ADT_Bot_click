July 12, 2024 | Lifestyle Staff 511 Bar & Lounge is the newest hotspot in Fort Lauderdale’s trendy Flagler Village, catering to whiskey aficionados and cocktail lovers. Since its discreet launch this past Spring, it has quickly become a favorite among locals. It boasts a stylish industrial interior and a chic backyard patio with lawn games, twinkling lights, and plenty of seating under umbrellas. “We have all been a part of the Fort Lauderdale bar and hospitality scene for over 30 years, collectively, so when we decided to open 511 Bar & Lounge together, it was truly more of a passion project than anything else,” says co-owner Digby Nothard. “It was important for us to create a space that reflects and compliments the Flagler Village community with great quality cocktails, each made with a two-ounce pour of love, lots of local brands and brews, and a welcoming atmosphere where guests can kick back with friends, their dogs and just enjoy.” Crafted by co-owner Trent O’Connor, renowned from Maryland’s historic “The Horse You Came In on Saloon” and Fort Lauderdale’s “Whiskey Neat,” the cocktail menu embodies his affection for Fort Lauderdale, offering a mix of classic and inventive concoctions. Notable selections include the Mimi, featuring Don Julio Blanco, fresh mango, lime, muddled jalapeno, and a Tajin rim; Pretty in Pink, composed of Partida Reposado Tequila, Aperol, freshly squeezed grapefruit and lime juice, finished with Q Mixers club soda; KB Special: made with Espolon Reposado Tequila, Orange Liqueur, agave, freshly squeezed lime and orange juice, cream of coconut, and orange zest; and a variety of freshly prepared Margaritas, available with flavor enhancements such as mango, peach, prickly pear, passion fruit, strawberry or watermelon. The bar also offers the Crush Cocktail, a Baltimore favorite made with the fresh juice of a whole orange or lemon. Guests can choose between the traditional Orange Crush, made with Deep Eddy’s Orange Vodka and freshly squeezed orange juice over crushed ice, topped with Sprite, or the Peach Lemonade Crush, featuring Bulleit Bourbon, peach nectar, freshly squeezed lemon juice over crushed ice, topped with Sprite. The 1,500-square-foot space features artwork by local artists, including a striking pixelated Everglades landscape by Peter Nolan that serves as the bar’s focal point. The indoor bar seamlessly transitions into a 2,500-square-foot outdoor patio, accommodating up to 30 people. Here, guests can indulge in delectable offerings from a rotating selection of food trucks such as BMC Smash Burger, La Condensa Tacos, Mambas Pizza, Duck Fat Dogs, Mr. Meatball, Bohemian Grill, Carlo’s and Pepe’s, and more. This diverse array of tempting street food perfectly complements the beverages served at 511. During happy hour, which runs every Wednesday through Friday from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., patrons can enjoy special deals such as $6 Premium Well Liquor, $7 Fresh Margaritas, $8 Orange, Ruby Red Grapefruit and John Daly Crushes, along with discounted beer and wine by the glass. Additionally, live music takes the spotlight every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with local bands and DJs performing a variety of genres, including classic rock, blues, 80’s classic rock, soul and electronic music. “We strongly believe that live music and entertainment is the heartbeat of Fort Lauderdale’s vibrant nightlife,” O’Connor says. “It brings our community together, creating unforgettable moments and an electrifying atmosphere that reflects the spirit of our city. This is why we are committed to showcasing incredible local talent and providing a stage where local artists can shine.” 511 Bar & Lounge not only features an outdoor patio but also boasts a 13,000 sqft event space behind the restaurant for hosting large-scale events. This space will host recurring monthly themed events such as Jazz & Blues Nights, Country Nights, and more. These events will feature themed food truck vendors, sponsors, and live music talent.

In the Spirit Of Change Spirited Change initiative The Spirits Industry has historically been devoid of significant ownership and representation of diverse communities. Black, brown, female, and LGBTQ+  entrepreneurs have not successfully penetrated the multi-billion dollar wine, spirits, and craft beer industries. In fact, less than 5% of brands are owned by BIPOC and/or women entrepreneurs. Out of this dilemma, Spirited Change was born! We have partnered with brands and companies big and small to make measurable change in support of diverse communities. We invite you to share in this support by exploring this collection of spirits and wine!

It is located at Lauderdale’s hip Flagler Village , a place where creatives connect and new spots with unique environments and experiences have been popping up all around. While 511 Bar & Lounge is a place where you can kick back and relax, it also mixes in a touch of elegance with handcrafted cocktails, alongside top spirits. Those who enjoy top-notch whiskies, a chill and homey vibe, as well as fun adventures will love this new place that’s already making waves in the area. Also, the elegant bar is inviting, one where laughter mixes in with different conversations, a perfect place to connect and sample spirits and drinks suggested by the 511 Bar & Lounge owners and staff. 511 Bar & Lounge is not only a place where you can bring your pets, relax on a soft chair inside the spot, or even kick back on the outdoor patio. You can also pair your drinks with food from food trucks that visit the lounge daily and offer all sorts of culinary treats, like the Italian bites that we indulged on during our visit. When we visited for the first trivia night and to take in the environment, we were wowed by the food truck that offered creative Italian offerings. The food truck, known as I Love Panzerotti, doesn’t onlyserve pizzasand oven-baked or fried calzones, so you can have it your way, but it also offers yummy dishes such as dessert pizzas and pressed paninis. And, if you want to add a little something refreshing to the mix during trivia night, their seltzer buckets with Highnoon, Surfside or Nutrl are 5 for $25. Our visit was also a treat thanks to a competitive and engaging Trivia Nigh hosted by Geeks Who Drink. The questions were part of the night’s conversations, and you could sense that everyone was enjoying the entertainment and how the lounge mixes in elegance and fun. Feeling like a little happy hour is in order? Then you are in luck, because the lounge offers happy hour from 4 to 7 pm where you can enjoy $6 Premium well liquor, $7 fresh margaritas, and $8 beverages such as the unique and refreshing Orange and Ruby Red Grapefruit crushes. While 511 Bar & Lounge is casual, there’s nothing casual about how seriously they take their cocktail menu and how they handcraft these cocktails with true passion. From a perfectly balanced old-fashioned to flavorful martinis and everything in between, this is a place where lovers of true and creative mixology will find themselves like they’re right at home. The spot will be offering other forms of entertainment in the future, such as jazz nights and even more trivia. We recommend setting aside some time to visit this warm and inviting place with friends, and we promise you that you will enjoy an unforgettable and relaxed time as you take in the lounge’s positive energy. It will introduce its Booze, Blues, BBQ & Booze event on Saturday, Aug. 24 . The monthly Jazz and Blues party will occur once a month at the lounge and promises an immersive and fun experience for those who love a little soothing music and fun vibes with a side of good BBQ.
