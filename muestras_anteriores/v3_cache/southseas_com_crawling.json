During that time, enrolled members of the Osage Indian nation were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world. The rich oil fields beneath their reservation brought millions of dollars into the tribe annually, distributed to tribal members holding \"headrights\" that could not be bought or sold but only inherited. This vast wealth attracted the attention of unscrupulous whites who found ways to divert it to themselves by marrying Osage women or by having Osage declared legally incompetent so the whites could fleece them through the administration of their estates. For some, however, these deceptive tactics were not enough, and a plague of violent death—by shooting, poison, orchestrated automobile accident, and bombing—began to decimate the Osage in what they came to call the \"Reign of Terror.\" Corrupt and incompetent law enforcement and judicial systems ensured that the perpetrators were never found or punished until the young J. Edgar Hoover saw cracking these cases as a means of burnishing the reputation of the newly professionalized FBI. Bestselling New Yorker staff writer Grann ( The Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession , 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn't stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann's crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs. Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil. 76 Pub Date: April 18, 2017 ISBN: 978-0-385-53424-6 Page Count: 352 Publisher: Doubleday Review Posted Online: Feb. 1, 2017 Kirkus Reviews Issue: Feb. 15, 2017 Categories: GENERAL HISTORY | TRUE CRIME | UNITED STATES | FIRST/NATIVE NATIONS | HISTORY Share your opinion of this book More by David Grann BOOK REVIEW THE <i>WAGER</i> by David Grann BOOK REVIEW KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON by David Grann BOOK REVIEW THE LOST CITY OF Z by David Grann More About This Book BOOK TO SCREEN Brendan Fraser Joins Cast of ‘Flower Moon’ Film BOOK TO SCREEN Oct. 20 Release For 'Killers of the Flower Moon' BOOK TO SCREEN ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’: Out of Focus BOOK LIST 20 Books for Serious Foodies 36 Reviews NONFICTION shop now amazon bookshop bookshelf NIGHT by Elie Wiesel & \n                    translated by Marion Wiesel ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 16, 2006 The author's youthfulness helps to assure the inevitable comparison with the Anne Frank diary although over and above the... bookshelf shop now amazon bookshop Elie Wiesel spent his early years in a small Transylvanian town as one of four children. He was the only one of the family to survive what Francois Maurois, in his introduction, calls the \"human holocaust\" of the persecution of the Jews, which began with the restrictions, the singularization of the yellow star, the enclosure within the ghetto, and went on to the mass deportations to the ovens of Auschwitz and Buchenwald. There are unforgettable and horrifying scenes here in this spare and sombre memoir of this experience of the hanging of a child, of his first farewell with his father who leaves him an inheritance of a knife and a spoon, and of his last goodbye at Buchenwald his father's corpse is already cold let alone the long months of survival under unconscionable conditions. The author's youthfulness helps to assure the inevitable comparison with the Anne Frank diary although over and above the sphere of suffering shared, and in this case extended to the death march itself, there is no spiritual or emotional legacy here to offset any reader reluctance. 36 Pub Date: Jan. 16, 2006 ISBN: 0374500010 Page Count: 120 Publisher: Hill & Wang Review Posted Online: Oct. 7, 2011 Kirkus Reviews Issue: Jan. 15, 2006 Categories: BIOGRAPHY & MEMOIR | HOLOCAUST | HISTORY | GENERAL BIOGRAPHY & MEMOIR | GENERAL HISTORY Share your opinion of this book More by Elie Wiesel BOOK REVIEW FILLED WITH FIRE AND LIGHT by Elie Wiesel ; \n                    edited by Alan Rosen BOOK REVIEW THE TALE OF A NIGGUN by Elie Wiesel ; \n                    illustrated by Mark Podwal BOOK REVIEW NIGHT by Elie Wiesel ; \n                    translated by Marion Wiesel Discover Books Fiction Thriller & Suspense Mystery & Detective Romance Science Fiction & Fantasy Nonfiction Biography & Memoir Teens & Young Adult Children's News & Features Bestsellers Book Lists Profiles Perspectives Awards Seen & Heard Book to Screen Kirkus TV videos In the News Kirkus Prize Winners & Finalists About the Kirkus Prize Kirkus Prize Judges Magazine Current Issue All Issues Manage My Subscription Subscribe Writers’ Center Hire a Professional Book Editor Get Your Book Reviewed Advertise Your Book Launch a Pro Connect Author Page Learn About The Book Industry More Kirkus Diversity Collections Kirkus Pro Connect My Account/Login About Kirkus History Our Team Contest FAQ Press Center Info For Publishers Contact us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Reprints, Permission & Excerpting Policy Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Reprints, Permission & Excerpting Policy © Copyright 2025 Kirkus Media LLC.
