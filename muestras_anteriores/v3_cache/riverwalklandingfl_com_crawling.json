All three ratings categories are measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Less than 1 percent of parks or campgrounds receive the coveted 10 | 10 ★ | 10 rating, which indicates superior facilities that are well maintained, clean, well-appointed restrooms and a highly appealing appearance. Campgrounds are inspected annually by dedicated RVers like you. Completeness of facilities 10 | 10 ★ | 10 The first campground rating evaluates completeness and quality of facilities.

We offer both back-in and pull-through big-rig friendly sites. What is your cancellation policy? We offer our “ Peace of Mind ” rate, which, with 72-hours notice prior to your arrival is fully refundable and less than a 10% cancellation fee except during holiday periods. In addition, we also offer our “Best Available” rate, which is set in stone with no changes or cancellations. You will be given the option to choose between the two rates at the time of booking. Is there a minimum night stay requirement? Only during holidays, there is a 3-night minimum and all reservations are non-refundable: Memorial Day, 4th of July, and Labor Day. How do I request a specific site or area? Please give us a call at (877) 436-5063 and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Is it pet friendly? What breeds? Yes, we are a pet-friendly property (dogs and cats only). Please visit our Pet Policy page for complete details. We have a strict pet leash policy to protect all guests and pets. Pets must be leashed at all times while on property. This is one of the biggest violations we encounter with our guests. As far as breed restrictions, we don’t necessarily have any. Any guest in violation of pet policies will be fined and/or asked to leave, regardless of the pet’s breed. Do you sell cottages? Yes, we offer options for cottage ownership! Ownership is exactly what it means—true ownership of the unit (unlike a timeshare). This is a better, more flexible and more affordable way to have a second home—while you also benefit from rentals.

Meet the Park City Rental Properties Team Kenny Green President Jen Ali Director of Owner Relations Jim Anderson Business Development Executive With a background in Park City and Deer Valley real estate, Jim transitioned over to the vacation rental management world to help PCRP grow its owner base. He is an expert at networking, growing the sphere of influence, connecting with the local real estate community, and helping owners and Realtors better understand the rental market. His vast knowledge of the area and the vacation rental market allows him to guide people in the right direction when they are looking for cash flow properties. Jim has a Bachelor’s Degree in Real Estate Finance and Development from Central Michigan University. Operations Team Jake Mulvey Director of Operations Jake has called Park City home for over a decade. For the past seven years, he worked with the PCRP Sales and Revenue teams before recently transitioning to a role in Operations. A true enthusiast of everything Park City has to offer, Jake enjoys snowboarding, mountain biking, golfing, and hiking with his dogs. He holds an accounting degree from Appalachian State University. Caleb Weis Operations Manager Mitchell Heberer Operations Manager Witzen Rodriguez Operations Manager Owner Relations Team Jennie Munguia Owner Relations Manager Lynne LeBlanc Owner Relations Manager Amanda Evenstad Owner Relations Manager Amanda is a Utah native who brings a decade of experience in real estate and operations to her role as Owner Relations Manager. Her experience ranges from property renovations and HOA management to leading top-producing teams, equipping her with both strategic insight and on-the-ground know-how. Focusing on simplifying the complex details so owners and guests experience a smooth, worry-free stay. When she’s not helping properties thrive, you can find her at the local farmers' markets, hitting the slopes, or enjoying a good game of billiards. Sandra Engel Owner Relations Manager After spending 15 years as an International Tax Manager with KPMG, I decided to trade spreadsheets for something a little more “chill” (haha) and joined Park City Rental Properties in 2017. Shortly after starting, I became the Regional Onboarding Manager for all our locations (busy, busy) and now part of the Owner Relations team.\n \nWhen I’m not helping owners, you’ll find me making the most of Park City’s charm—soaking up the summer sunshine, catching a show or concert at The Egyptian Theatre, enjoying outdoor live music and fun festivals, or exploring hiking and biking trails. Add in a glass of good wine, good friends, and some crisp mountain air, and I’m exactly where I want to be. × Get In Touch 314 Main Street, Suite 101 Park City, Utah 84060 (435) 200-1223 reservations@parkcityvacationrentals.com Follow Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Owner Login Popular Links All Park City Rentals All Deer Valley Vacation Rentals All Canyon Rentals Additional Communities Search All Vacation Rentals Holiday Rentals Alphabetical Property List About Us Our Rentals Condo Rentals Home Rentals Mansion Rentals Ski In/Out Spring Rentals Rental Deals © 2025 Park City Rental Properties Vacation Rentals Know the unit name?
