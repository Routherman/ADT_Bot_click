Weeks 1 -7: Standard Play (4 games/night) Week 8**: Make-Ups Night Week 9: Double Elimination Tournament *Some seasons have a week 10 that WATL added due to expected conflicts with holidays on League nights **Make-ups night will be used on a full group level due to holidays or emergencies (ex: hurricane) that fall on a league night.  If there are not any holidays/emergencies, then this night is used for individuals who missed nights during the season to get caught up.  This might technically be week 9 in the event of a 10 week season. 2025 League Schedule Winter/Season 1: Jan 4 – March 16 ( Completed ) Spring/Season 2: April 12 – June 15 ( Call to sign up! 727-271-2863, new members can be accepted until week 2) Summer/Season 3: July 5 – September 7 Fall/Season 4: September 27 – December 7 Are there prizes?
