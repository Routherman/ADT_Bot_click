She will be performing a dual role at the restaurant as bartender and beverage director. Most people know what a bartender does, but few understand the job of beverage director, which is “all about the numbers to give guests the best value,” explains Shelby. “I am responsible for knowing my inventory, placing orders for highest quality product, knowing my vendors, invoicing and observing what moves off the shelf.” More importantly to the thirsty and sophisticated clientele, tending bar requires her to know how to stir, blend, shake and pour every drink out there, including the latest beverage trends and how to refine drinks to suit a customer’s preferences. A URI graduate, Shelby was born and raised in North Kingstown where she hails from a family of fishermen. She may be the only beverage director with a boat named after her. What are the drinks that are trending these days? “Vintage cocktails are back, like Champagne cocktails and Sidecars, but I tweak them to create something more contemporary. Every city I visit has its own drinking style. Providence is funky and enjoys trying something new.” What makes a great mixologist? “Knowing what you have to work with, what the trends are and constantly developing new drink ideas. And get to know your guests. Do they prefer sweet, floral or savory? Be able to suggest something new that they might enjoy. For example, I like to contrast flavors, pairing a salty dish with a slightly sweet drink.” What is your favorite summer drink? “Clean, crisp cocktails. Something like a ‘spritzer plus,’ not sweet like a piña colada, but fun and fresh; maybe a margarita with fresh squeezed limes and a touch of jalapeño.” Save Save Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Pinterest 0 Post navigation Previous post Mill’s Tavern’s Secret Garden Next post Sous Chef, Ashleigh Blais prepares Braised Little Necks on the Rhode Show!

Metz invites golfers to participate in the 21st Annual Golf Classic to benefit Special Olympics Georgia on Oct. 14. The tournament returns to TPC Sugarloaf for a second year with golfers engaging in fun-filled competition with contests, prizes and classic American tavern fare. The afternoon culminates with a festive after-party, awards dinner and silent auction. \r\n\r\n\tSince 1999 and following last year's record-breaking tournament, Marlow's Tavern and Sterling Culinary Management have raised more than $1 million for Special Olympics Georgia through the tournament and restaurant openings. Donations have funded athletic competitions and provided life-changing experiences to some 9,800 athletes, their families and the community.  \r\n\r\nThose interested in signing up for the golf tournament or sponsorship opportunities (beginning at $350) can contact Mariel Hicks at 770-414-9390 x113 or Mariel.Hicks@specialolympicsga.org.

Metz to celebrate. The fact that his business partner Thomas H. DiGiorgio has agreed to serve as chair of the 2018 event makes the tournament even more momentous. DiGiorgio, who designed the first Marlow’s Tavern, has partnered with Metz on the successful restaurant venture for close to 23 years. Formerly president of DK Group, a Florida-based architectural development and contract firm, DiGiorgio currently heads up Sterling Hospitality Group’s real estate and development arm. “I am thrilled to confirm that Tommy has accepted my request to be our chairman for this year’s Golf Classic,” Metz said. “I can’t think of a better way to ring in the event’s 20th anniversary than with my business partner of over two decades heading up this incredible event.” DiGiorgio, who’s played in 16 of the 20 tourneys, is honored to be responsible for raising awareness and hopefully record-breaking funds for the organization that impacts so many lives. “For me, the best part of this event has been meeting these Special Olympians,” DiGiorgio said. “Listening to athletes talk about what the organization has meant to them makes me even more appreciative of what SOGA does.” The 20th Annual Golf Classic will take place at TPC Sugarloaf on Oct. 15. Registration begins at 8:30 a.m. The event will be a fun-filled competition with contests, prizes and classic American tavern fare for all involved. The companies also aim to top $1 million in donations over the 20-year-old fundraiser. The tournament will be followed by a festive after-party complete with awards dinner and silent auction. Marlow’s Tavern has three Cobb County locations at 745 Chastain Road NW, Suite 1160 in Kennesaw; 1311 Johnson Ferry Road, Suite 208 in the Merchant's Walk Shopping Center in Marietta; and 2355 Cumberland Parkway, Suite 10 in Vinings.

Meet the Metz The Citizen's Voice By: Denise Allabaugh Date: June 25, 2017 Please click here for article. DALLAS — For John C. Metz Sr., his golden rule in business is treat people how you want to be treated. “The more successful we make people, the more successful we’re going to be,” Metz said. “We have a really easy philosophy about how we treat people and it works. If you treat people right, they’ll work hard for you.” Since Metz founded Metz Culinary Management Inc. 24 years ago, the family-driven food service management company based in Dallas has grown and now operates in 19 states from Maine to Florida with nearly 7,000 employees. Does Metz have a secret to his success? “There isn’t really a secret,” he said. “We just work hard.” Metz spoke during an interview at his company’s corporate headquarters in Dallas. “It’s a business of relationships,” he said. “You’ve got to have a good reputation and your reputation sells you.” Metz said the company’s value is in it’s workers. “When you’re a service organization, all your assets are your people,” he said. “You own some buildings, but that’s not where your assets really lie. Your assets are the people who run your business and take care of your business. We just work hard to protect those assets and help them grow and help them develop into bigger and better things in their lives. The more successful we make people, the more successful we’re going to be.” Before Metz served as chairman of Metz Culinary Management, he began his career in the food service management industry by founding Custom Management Corp., where he served as president and chief executive officer from 1967 to 1987. When he sold that company in 1987, he said it was the largest privately held food services company in the country. “We were in 37 states and we had 12,000 employees,” he said. Metz, a Harveys Lake resident, said he is blessed to have three “great kids” in the business. His daughter Maureen is Metz Culinary Management’s executive vice president of merchandising. His son, Jeff Metz, who serves as president and CEO, recently was honored in Chicago as a 2017 Silver Plate Award recipient by the International Facility Management Association. Metz was the third member of his family to receive the prestigious honor. His brother John Metz Jr., CEO, executive chef and co-founder of Marlow’s Tavern and Sterling Spoon Culinary Management based in Atlanta, won the Gold Plate Award in 2013 after being named the Silver Plate Award recipient. He started Sterling Spoon Culinary Management in 2004 and it has grown into two states: Georgia and Florida. He operates 22 restaurants. John Sr. received the Silver Plate Award in 1979 and it still hangs in his office in Dallas. The Marriotts are the only other family with three Silver Plate Award recipients. “It really was a recognition of all the work that all of our team members do every day,” Jeff Metz said. “I was very fortunate to go up and accept that on their behalf.” Jeff Metz said he believes one of the company’s key ingredients is the “great people working for us and with us.” “We treat them like they are part of the family and part of the team and we really feel that way,” he said. Metz Culinary Management also was recently named the 14th best contract company in the nation by Food Management Magazine. The company provides dining services for clients in a variety of settings, including schools such as Crestwood, Dallas, Nanticoke, Hanover Area, Holy Redeemer, Wyoming Seminary, Scranton Prep and soon Lake-Lehman; colleges and universities including Misericordia University, Commonwealth Medical College and Johnson College in Scranton; hospitals such as Wilkes-Barre General Hospital and Tyler Memorial Hospital in Tunkhannock; corporate offices and manufacturing facilities. Metz brought Chick-fil-A, Proudly Brewed By Starbucks and a Chopping Block salad bar to Misericordia University. “We feel that food service can be good in institutions. We’ve always felt that way,” John C. Metz Sr. said. “The key is having good food and people want choices and they’re attracted to brands. We try to put well-known good quality brands in our operations and the students like it.” Metz also owns 11 TGI Friday’s franchise locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including restaurants in Wilkes-Barre and Dickson City; Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Wolfgang Puck Express and Elixir Bar and Bistro in Mohegan Sun Pocono in Plains Twp., Lucky’s Sporthouse in Wilkes-Barre Twp., Lucky’s Craft Food & Drink and Dunkin’ Donuts in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Airport and two Krispy Kreme locations in western Pennsylvania. In the future, John C. Metz Sr. said he believes the company will continue to grow. “Last year, we had probably one of the best growth years we’ve had in a long time. We grew at a tremendous rate,” he said. “We grow fast enough to keep creating opportunities for people to grow. People have the opportunities to advance to higher positions.” Become an Insider Contact Us Catering Careers Team Members Mobile App Real Estate Inquiry Download The Marlow's Mobile App App Store Link Google Play Link Facebook X (Twitter) Instagram © 2025 Marlow's Tavern Donation Requests Marketing & PR Privacy Policy Employment Verification & W2s Close Want $10 OFF $30?
