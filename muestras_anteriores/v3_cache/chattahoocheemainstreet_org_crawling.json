      "text": "About About Main Street MENU Welcome About Main Street Projects Events Join Us Downtown Businesses Volunteer Contact Us DONATE Join Main street JOIN The National Main Street Center, a private, non-profit organization, was established by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1980 to stimulate economic development within a context of historic preservation. The Florida Main Street program was established in 1985. Administered by the Department of State, Bureau of Historic Preservation, it provides technical assistance to more than 40 active Florida Main Street communities for their traditional historic commercial corridors. The Bureau conducts statewide programs aimed at identifying, evaluating, and preserving Floridaâs historic resources. Main Street, with its emphasis on preservation, is an effective strategy in achieving these goals in Floridaâs historic retail districts. As a Main Street Americaâ¢ Accredited program, Chattahoochee Main Street is a recognized leading program among the national network of more than 1,200 neighborhoods and communities who share both a commitment to creating high-quality places and to building stronger communities through preservation-based economic development. All Main Street Americaâ¢ Accredited programs meet a set of National Accreditation Standards of Performance as outlined by the National Main Street Center. Main Street Approach As a unique preservation-based economic development tool, the Main Street Four Point ApproachÂ® is the foundation for local initiatives to revitalize their districts by leveraging local assetsâfrom cultural or architectural heritage to local enterprises and community pride. The four points of the Main Street approach work together to build a sustainable and complete community revitalization effort. Through education, training, case-studies, and peer-to-peer learning, the National Main Street Center equips communities with the tools they need for long-term, comprehensive, preservation-based community revitalization. Guiding Principles The National Main Street Centerâs experience in helping communities bring their commercial corridors back to life has shown time and time again that the Main Street Four-Point Approach succeeds. That success is guided by the following eight principles, which set the Main Street methodology apart from other redevelopment strategies. For a Main Street program to be successful, it must whole-heartedly embrace the time-tested Eight Principles. â Board Members Pam Medley Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Treasurer Interim Executive Director Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2013-Present Pam Medley serves as the Treasurer of the Board and has been with Chattahoochee Main Street since it's designation in 2013.

In addition to volunteering and serving on the CMS Board of Directors, she also enjoys cooking, baking, sketching, and water color. Committees Across the nation, small cities are discovering that the âMain Streetâ approach can bring about dramatic, positive change downtown. This approach advocates improvements in four areas to create a distinctive image for downtown: Economic Revitalization Improving the economic base of downtown by strengthening existing businesses, recruiting new businesses, and performing market analysis. Successful communities accomplish this by evaluating how to retain and expand successful businesses to provide a balanced commercial mix, sharpening the competitiveness and merchandising skills of business owners, and attracting new businesses that the market can support. Many Main Street programs also achieve success through creative reuse of historic properties. Converting unused or underused commercial space into economically productive property also helps boost the profitability of the district. The goal is to build a commercial district that responds to the needs of todayâs consumers while maintaining the communityâs historic character. Design Design means getting Main Street into top physical shape by preserving a placeâs historic character, encouraging quality building rehabilitation, signage, public improvements and faÃ§ade improvements to improve the appearance of downtown. This includes public spaces, parking areas, street furniture, public art, landscaping, merchandising, window displays, and promotional materials. Popular design activities also include instilling good maintenance practices in the commercial district, enhancing the districtâs physical appearance through the rehabilitation of historic buildings, encouraging appropriate new construction, developing sensitive design management systems, educating business and property owners about design quality, and long-term planning. Promotion Creating and marketing a positive image of downtown through special events, retail sales, effective advertising and public relations. Promotions communicate the commercial districtâs unique characteristics, its cultural traditions, architecture, and history and activities to shoppers, investors, potential business and property owners, and visitors. Organization Organization establishes consensus and cooperation by building partnerships among the various groups that have a stake in the commercial district. They work with public and private sector community leaders to develop and coordinate resources to revitalize downtown. mission Dedicated to promoting a better quality of life for our community through historic preservation, education, revitalization of downtown Chattahoochee and the River Landing, and arts and cultural events.

High on a hill above the east bank where the Apalachicola River begins its winding journey to the Gulf of Mexico, a walk through our town evokes feelings of both quiet nostalgia and a restless spirit yearning for a vibrant future. â The oldest buildings lining the downtown stand as embattled sentinels. Though many are in various states of disrepair, they steadfastly remain; each having its own story to tell. Listen closely as you stroll by the old Gibson Theater while the sun begins to set over the River, and you might believe you hear the chattering hum of the old projector reel rolling and even swear that you detect a faint scent of gunpowder as if Randolph Scott jumped off the movie screen and his trusty Winchester rifle once again found its mark. Come experience Chattahoochee and play a role in a new chapter of stories yet to be told. Serene Lake Seminole and the mighty Apalachicola River are a sportsmanâs paradise. The dark waters are teaming with largemouth bass and stripers voraciously pursuing their next prey. Come experience Chattahoochee and cast a line to see how quickly your cork goes under and your line runs tight. â The people who make Chattahoochee their home are the greatest treasures of all.
