The Forum began on Sept. 13 with a Farm Tour a nd stops at Secret Gardens Winery , Sugar Sand Distillery , and The PARC .  A Farm-to-Table Dinner, provided by Culina at the PARC, was available for purchase at the last stop. The Forum continued Sept. 14 with speakers and panelists discussing a variety of agritourism topics including trends and opportunities for Florida agritourism, how to market your operation, agritourism rules and liability, marketing, how to work with extension, business planning, agritourism perceptions, and funding sources to start or expand your agritourism business. “This was the result of Visit Sebring’s outreach to our local agritourism partners during our 2021 stakeholder meetings,” said Casey Hartt, Visit Sebring’s Lead Marketing Consultant.  “This educational forum is one thing they asked for during those meetings, so we worked in collaboration with other organizations to make it happen.” Agritourism is a way to merge Florida’s two largest industries: tourism and agriculture.  In post-event surveys, registrants noted that they attended for education and information on how to start or expand their agritourism business, to learn what resources are available, to spur agritourism in their community, and for the opportunity to network with other agritourism operators. “With so much of Florida’s ag land being developed, agritourism is a way for bona fide ag operators to add an additional revenue stream to their business while keeping the land in agriculture,” Hartt said.  “Tourists and locals are intrigued with farming and ranching, and they will pay for these educational and informative experiences.” The Forum was co-hosted by Visit Sebring/Highlands County Tourist Development Council (TDC) , Florida Agritourism Association , Highlands County Extension/IFAS , Highlands County Farm Bureau , and the Greater Sebring Chamber of Commerce . Visit Sebring is the destination marketing organization managed by the Highlands County Tourist Development Council (TDC).  The mission of the TDC is to contribute to a positive quality of life for the residents of Highlands County through destination promotion, tourism development, advocacy, and resource management – which are foundation pieces for future economic growth.  For more information, visit https://www.VisitSebring.com or find us on social media @VisitSebring.

Each event will target a different group of individuals, but both events are expected to attract a great volume of participants plus additional spectators. “Landing these two new events to our destination is part of our ongoing efforts with Airstream Ventures to attract more sports tourism, and more tourists, to the area,” said Visit Sebring’s Casey Hartt. “Having these tournaments here helps infuse dollars into our local economy during our tourism industry’s slower early summer season.” The American Cornhole League Championship will take place at Bernie Little Distributors new facility on Scenic Highway starting Friday, May 13. The Florida State Women’s Singles will kick-off the weekend at 3:00 p.m. followed by Juniors Singles, Seniors Singles, Intermediate Blind Draw, Competitive Blind Draw, and ending the evening with the Advanced Blind Draw. Saturday will begin at 9:00 a.m. with Advanced Doubles, then moving on to Competitive Singles, Intermediate Doubles, and Co-Ed. Sunday, May 15 will bring the event to an end starting with Advanced Singles at 10:00 a.m. then competitive doubles and closing out the day with Intermediate Singles. “We are so excited to partner with Visit Sebring and Airstream Ventures in bringing our State Championship to this part of Florida,” said Rob Chismark, American Cornhole League State Director. “We look forward to hosting hundreds of competitors from all over the country in order to crown our state champion.” The Sebring Lacrosse College Showcase will feature the top male lacrosse athletes in the state of Florida. Saturday, May 14 at the Highlands County Sports Complex will start the two-day showcase. Registration will begin at 8:00 a.m. directly following, all prospects will go through two hours of skills development, after a break, two hours of positional concepts. Parents will have the opportunity to meet with NCAA coaches in a classroom setting to learn about the recruiting process, what needs to be done, what is true and false, and how to get your son to be the best lacrosse player he can be. All instruction is by NCAA and MCLA Coaches. Sunday, May 15 beginning at 9:00 a.m. prospects will learn skills from the best NCAA coaches in our game. Individual and group work will lead to full-field lacrosse IQ development. The rest of the day will include IQ development and team play in front of and coached by NCAA coaches. “Lacrosse is the fastest growing team sport in the country, and we are excited to bring our college showcase event to Sebring,” said Tom West, Florida Prep Director. “We will be hosting some of the best male players from all over the southeast along with welcoming college coaches from all over the country.” -30- Visit Sebring is the destination marketing organization managed by the Highlands County Tourist Development Council (TDC).

The resort will open with six cabins, with a goal of adding another 24 cabins over the next five years. Visitors will be fully immersed in nature while still enjoying creature comforts including air-conditioned cottages, organic mosquito control, a swimming pond, indoor and outdoor showers, and more. (Opening fall, 2022) o   The resort will also be home to a new farm-to-table restaurant, Par Paul-Hus, with most ingredients coming from Inn the Woods farm. (Opening spring, 2022) A seven-room boutique hotel and an Irish pub will take over an historic building in Sebring’s downtown circle. With Gavaghan’s on the ground floor, the Roanoke Hotel will occupy the second floor.

(Opening fall, 2022) Stay and Play Cabins at the Sebring International Golf Resort. Approximately 25 solar powered, premium cabins will be constructed in two different areas on the resort. Cabins overlooking the gorgeous 12-hole par-three course, known as the Resort Cabins, will be popular with golfers and include a personal golf cart for the duration of your stay.

The CRA has been acquiring prime properties in the downtown district that are poised for redevelopment and created a program to attract successful businesses to occupy these properties. Businesses apply to use the buildings and successful applicants are offered a five-year, lease-to-own scenario. Businesses make improvements to the property to suit their business needs and there are no lease/rent payments made to the CRA during that time. If the business is successful and delivers the concept that was proposed to the CRA, the CRA will transfer the ownership of the property at the end of the (5) year timeframe for free. Through this program Sebring is attracting quality businesses that are set up for success as the downtown grows.

Visitors, whether they’re familiar with the raceway or experiencing the excitement for the first time, can sense the traditions that have been carried through nearly seven decades of competition from start to finish—and we’re not just talking about the race itself. What started as Hendricks Army Airfield, a World War II base used to train B-17 combat crews, has now become the home to one of the most prestigious 12-hour endurance races known internationally, second to Le Mans. Thanks to aviation and racing enthusiast Alec Ulmann, this was made possible after he improvised the war base runways as a raceway track to host the first six-hour endurance race. It wasn’t until this pivotal moment that Sebring then marked its first 12-Hour Endurance Race just two years later and is now known as the most famous racetrack in the nation. 1950 Alec Ulmann suggests hosting a sports car road race at the Sebring Airport, which was built on Hendricks Field, a deactivated Army Air Force training base. The Sam Collier 6-Hour Memorial Race was held on December 31, 1950 as the first racing event ever held at Sebring and the first sports car endurance race held in the U.S. 1952 First 12 Hours of Sebring race held on March 15. 1953 12 Hours of Sebring race became the first event of the new FIA sports car world championship.

He was killed by police the following year trying to cross the border into Canada. Dale Earnhardt had a “secret” test in a factory Corvette at Sebring shortly before he died. Fact Earnhardt and his son Dale Jr. tested with the Corvette team in December 2000. The Sebring race was scheduled to relocate to West Palm Beach in 1967. Fact Yes, Alec Ulmann officially announced this but it never happened, in part due to heavy rains that flooded the new track near West Palm Beach a few months before the race. Ulmann considered moving the race to Fort Lauderdale in 1957. A movie starring Robert Redford was filmed at Sebring Raceway. Fact Portions of the 1975 movie “The Great Waldo Pepper” were filmed at the Sebring Airport and Raceway The 1974 race, before being cancelled, was changed to a 1,200-kilometer race (instead of 12 hours) to save fuel. Fact The sanctioning organization changed the race name to the “Sebring-Camel 1200 km” instead of “The 12 Hours of Sebring.” However, the race was never held. Walter Cronkite once drove in the 12 Hours of Sebring. Fact The famous journalist drove a Lancia in the 1959 Sebring 12 Hours. On his first practice lap three days before the race, he witnessed a fatal accident when Edwin Lawrence crashed his Maserati at the Hairpin.

Several cars started the 1955 Sebring 12 Hours without permission, sneaking on to the track during the start. Fact Six drivers of reserve entries, unhappy they were not allowed to start, decided to go on the track at the start, they all did one or two laps and then got off the track. A Ford GT involved in a fatal accident back in 1966 is buried at the track. Fact A Ford GT driven by Bob McLean, in which he was killed during a fiery accident approaching the hairpin in 1966, was buried at nearby property. There was very little left of the car. The remains of an Alfa Romeo also are buried near the circuit. We’re not telling where. Gene Hackman, James Brolin, Lorenzo Lamas, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, David Carradine and James Garner are all actors who have driven in the 12 Hours of Sebring. Fact Yes, they all did except Garner, who was a car owner in the 1960s and attended Sebring regularly but never drove in the race. During the 1957 Sebring 12 Hours, Stirling Moss slowed down at the Hairpin so someone could hand him a cold bottle of Coca-Cola. Fact Legendary photo-journalist Bernard Cahier handed Moss the Coke at the Hairpin, and on the next lap Moss tossed the empty bottle! Apple co-founder Steve Jobs drove in the 12 Hours of Sebring.

He was convinced to loan his car to drivers Ralph Deshon and Fritz Koster. They ended up winning the race, which was run on a handicap formula. The 12 Hours of Sebring was once a 24-hour race. Fiction For some reason this is one of the most common myths about Sebring. The race was NEVER a 24-hour race. Even though there was no Sebring race in 1974, devoted fans showed up anyway. Fact The actual number of fans who showed up that year is uncertain, estimated somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000. Roger Penske’s Chevrolet Lola was stolen after the 1969 Sebring 12 Hours. Fact While towing the car back from Sebring, the team stopped near Ormond Beach, where it was stolen (most of it was eventually recovered). A spectator once arrived three months early to get in line for the race. Fact The earliest arrival was by Patrick Taylor of Palm Bay, Florida, who arrived on December 26th 2003, nearly three months before the race. One of the victims of the Charles Manson family in 1969 was hair salon entrepreneur Jay Sebring, who named himself after the famous 12-hour race. Fact Sadly true. His real name was Thomas Kummer, but he chose Jay “Sebring” because he liked the name of the famous Florida sports car race.

About Us The purpose of the Sebring Historical Society is to collect, preserve, and make accessible archival material and historical records pertaining to Sebring and Highlands County and to promote our local history through programs and presentations, exhibits, publications, and electronic media. The history and evolution of Sebring’s pioneer families, their descendants, and their institutions makes fascinating reading. Take for example the birth and evolution of the Heacock Insurance Group. It was founded in Sebring in 1922 by Austin Heacock, who quickly turned control of the company over to his son, Ford Heacock Sr. (pictured on the right). After a number of years, Ford Heacock Sr. passed 50 percent of the company to his son, Ford Heacock Jr., and the other 50 percent to son-in-law George Hensley. Through the years, ownership has been passed on to other members of the family and today Ford Heacock III is the sole owner. Now he is gradually turning more and more authority over to his daughter Stacey, an executive vice president for the company, and to his brother Jason, the company’s president. Today, headquarters are in Lakeland, although the company still has a Sebring office. Likewise, Sebring has a rich architectural history with many buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. Over the years, many of these buildings have been retrofitted and put to new uses. Shown here is Harder Hall, a leading resort which opened in 1927 and operated until 1982, when it was sold to investors who tried unsuccessfully to convert it to timeshares. The building was acquired in 2007 by the City and sold in 2017 to a company with plans to turn it into assisted living. Agriculture has been the driving force of Sebring’s economy with citrus playing the most prominent role. Marvin Kahn is a local businessman who has achieved great success in this industry. Having inherited citrus groves from his father, a Jewish Lithuanian immigrant who migrated to Sebring in the 1920s, Mr. Kahn naturally gravitated to the citrus business. Besides managing thousands of groves, he runs Kahn Citrus Management, LLC, which provides grove development, caretaking, and marketing expertise to grove owners. In March 2018, he was inducted into the Citrus Hall of Fame (pictured right). Collecting, preserving, and sharing the history of Sebring through documents, photos, artifacts, audio and video files, DVDs and more is what the Sebring Historical Society does. Our Archives and Historical Records Office is open six days a week for visitors who would like to browse as well as for more serious researchers who would like to investigate topics in more depth. We have notebooks on more than 100 topics, and we also have newspapers dating back to 1916. We also have collections about individuals, like WWII pilot and hero Tommy McGuire, after whom McGuire Air Force Base is named, and about organizations like the Sebring Firemen’s Association, which was both a major social force and a political force in Sebring’s early years. Sebring Fire Department baseball team played competitively in the 1930s Orange Belt league.
