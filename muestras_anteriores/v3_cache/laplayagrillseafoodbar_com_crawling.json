Standing out in front of the restaurant are, from left, Christian Cabrera, line cook; Cindi Arnold, general manager; Christian’s brother, Pepe Cabrera, co-owner; Chuy Cabrera, line cook and father of Christian and Pepe; and Greg Villasana, co-owner. Staff photo by Dan Parker La Playa Mexican Grille will celebrate 20 years of doing business in Port Aransas with a fiesta on Saturday, April 22. It will include mariachis as well as music by Ty Dietz and Dreams, a Fleetwood Mac tribute band. Also part of the fun will be a 360 photo booth “as seen on the red carpet.” The fun starts at 5 p.m. Owner Greg Villasana opened the restaurant at 222 Beach St. in 2003 and since then has been serving family recipes and new recipes developed over the years. Villasana came by his kitchen chops naturally. His grandfather owned tortilla factories in Austin and Houston, his father owned a tortilla factory in Houston and his aunt owned The Tamale House in Austin at the corner of Congress Avenue and the river. The restaurant has had its low points and high points over the past 20 years of doing business in Port A. The low point, Villasana said, was the first five years when he wasn’t making any money. More recently, it’s been the difficulty in hiring people. He says he has to pay top-dollar to get anyone to come in the door to work. The 2007-2008 recession, when the economy around the country was in a slump, proved to be “some of the best years I’ve had,” Villasana said. “Everything here kept going.” Hurricane Harvey in 2017 resulted in a complete re- model of the restaurant from electrical, to the sheetrock, kitchen equipment and, most significantly, new air conditioning. During the pandemic, when people couldn’t go to Europe or Mexico, they went to Port Aransas, Villasana said. “We were affected negatively, but it could have been a lot worse,” he said. During that time, the restaurant offered to- go service only, “but we did a lot of business,” Villasana said. When restaurants were allowed to open to 25 percent capacity, he said, “We only opened for one night because it wasn’t worth it.” Now, he said, people are so used to calling for orders to go, that they have “kept rolling.” The future of La Playa will change at the end of 2025, Villasana said. That’s when co-owner Pepe Cabrera, will take over the business. “Port A has been real good to me,” Villasana said. “We get a lot of local support.” Loading Comments Featured Advertisers Loading Log In Contact Us Buy Single Issue Subscribe News Alerts This Weekend In Port A Privacy Policy Submit News Our Hometown DMCA Notices Newspaper website content management software and services Copyright © 2006-2025 Southern Publishing, Inc.

By Jean Bartlett | Pacifica Tribune UPDATED: August 12, 2016 at 4:28 AM PDT It’s a Saturday night in Pacifica and the crowds are pouring into La Playa, the popular Mexican restaurant that has been serving Pacifica in its Pedro Point Shopping Center location for more than 20 years. Nothing unusual there other than the restaurant has been under new ownership since September 16 — and the new owners, all fans and clients of La Playa’s original owner and founder Kevin Healey (now retired), have kept everything that people love about the place the same. They have the same outstanding staff and all the menu favorites. And while they are not subtracting from the menu, they are adding — new desserts and new vegetarian items. They are also expanding their Thursday through Sunday specials, which change weekly. In addition they have added to the beer and bar selections. The new owners are Sareena Mathan, and husband and wife Walter and Christy Allen. All three owners are Pacificans, and in the case of Walter and Christy, both grew up in Pacifica, though they didn’t meet until after high school. The trio met through Sareena’s boyfriend, Shawn Rhodes. (Rhodes, along with Greg Savin, owns the Nor Cal Surf Shop in the Pedro Point Shopping Center.) “Shawn and I grew up together,” Walter said. “Shawn told us that Kevin was starting to think about retirement and Christy and I have talked about owning a restaurant on and off for years.” Christy has restaurant experience. She worked as the assistant manager of San Francisco’s very happening Mercedes Restaurant, an “insider” Mexican restaurant in the Financial District. “Christy is an epic cook,” Sareena said, noting that each owner adds a “specialty” to the partnership. “She also knows management.” “I’m mostly the maintenance guy,” Walter laughed. (Both women added that he is also a good cook.) “Sareena is the business end of it,” Christy said. “She does the finance.” What are some of those “specials” offered? “For Valentine’s Day our special was rack of lamb with sweet mashed potatoes,” Christy said. “We did a rib eye steak with scalloped potatoes. We also did chicken wings and crab cakes and a heart-shaped flan.” Other February specials included: spinach and mushroom enchilada, mussel chorizo pasta and seafood soup. Up and coming? The restaurant’s famous “St. Patty’s Day” burritos and they are taking pre-orders now. “One of the great things about La Playa is not only do I run into people I went to school with, I also run into my former teachers,” Walter said. “My third grade teacher from Cabrillo is one of our customers. And besides folks from the community coming in, people from all over the world come to this shopping center. They come for the restaurants, they come for the shops, they come to surf — you hear an amazing amount of languages right here.” “We are definitely excited about our business,” Sareena said. “Our goal is to be a destination.” La Playa (Cantina & Grill), 5460 Pacific Coast Hwy, Pacifica. Open Tuesday through Sunday at 11:30 a.m. Closed Mondays. Closing hours vary from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. Visit La Playa on Facebook.
