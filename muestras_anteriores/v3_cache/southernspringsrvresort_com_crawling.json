Close Larry Mashaw VP Sales & Marketing × Larry Mashaw VP Sales & Marketing From the moment Larry arrived in Ski Town USA in 1984 he knew he had found the place to call home.

Upon completion of his Bachelor of Arts degree in Geography and Tourism from California State University, Chico he was attracted to Steamboat Springs by his interest in ski area development and the proposed (though ill-fated) Lake Catamount Ski Area.

A place to encourage your sense of adventure and see what’s over the next desert hill. A spot to float down the Colorado River or sit on the beach and destress from daily life — all with the people you love the most. We’re here to help you escape for a few days and make memories with people close to you. If you like family friendly atmospheres and playing outdoors, we think you’ll like it here. How We Got Started In The RV Business Arizona Oasis has been owned and operated by the Manthei family since 2014. The family got their start in creating RV communities in 1970 when Mary Manthei gave her son, Tim, the chance to do something with a piece of land in the desert near Palm Springs, California. Tim started digging in the desert and soon recruited a partner, as well as several brothers and cousins, to build an RV and manufactured home community called Sky Valley Resort . In the early 1990s, the family built another RV resort in Southern California called Caliente Springs . Both Sky Valley and Caliente are located on land with sulphur-free natural mineral hot springs. In 2014, the family decided to expand their goal of creating communities that improve lives with the purchase of Arizona Oasis. Today, the three resorts — Sky Valley, Caliente Springs and Arizona Oasis — are operated by Tim’s children and nephews. Get in touch 50238 Ehrenberg Rd.
