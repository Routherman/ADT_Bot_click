For years, that meant hauling Luci in a backpack. But by May 2019, it was a two-person job to get her into the pack. Even worse, Luci’s discomfort in the pack meant LJ had to boost her up by the bottom of her feet throughout the hike so she could tolerate the trail. The end of the trail? “As I walked, I wondered if this would be our last hike as a family on those kinds of trails,” LJ said. Not ready to give up, LJ leaned on his engineering expertise to conceptualize what would become the Cascade Cart. He bought basic materials hoping to be ready for a fall backpacking trip. But life got in the way. The backpacking trip didn’t happen. The raw materials gathered dust in his garage. Two years later, he decided to get rid of the parts along with the guilt of not finishing the project. While hauling the parts to his trailer to take them to the dump, something inside told him just to “finish the dang thing.” Pathfinding So he reversed course and bought additional tools to be able to finish it in time for a family trip to Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone. He painted the pieces the day they left and did some testing. Luci approved. Throughout the trip, people, sometimes pushing wheelchairs, literally ran him down to ask where they could get one of the carts. He told them he made it, kindly turned them down to make another and moved on. He didn’t have time to make another no matter how disappointed people were. The conversations with people who needed a cart like he had ate at him. But with commitments to God, family, health and employment chewing up his time, something had to go. Employment was the only thing he could see living without, so he quit a successful 11-year career to open up time for Huckleberry Hiking. Even that committed, he found it was harder than he thought and nearly backed out, seeking a job and side engineering gigs four times in the first eight months. Sparking a Wildefire In June 2023, a stranger who met him on the trail posted about the cart on Facebook. The woman didn’t have a massive social following, but her post caught fire. Soon thousands knew about Huckleberry Hiking and were sharing their hopes with him: “Thank you for not quitting!” “Cheering you on from Oklahoma!” “Keep up the great work and thank you for all you’re doing for our kids!” “Please keep going on this Huckleberry Hiker wheelchair because it meets a need for many many families and kids.” “I can imagine that this is not an easy path and that your family has…had to sacrifice a lot for this, but I hope that you…keep on going!” At that point, LJ smashed the rearview mirror and really went all-in. Since then, it’s been a parade of product testing, development and learning that has led to the Cascade Cart. It opened up the world for Luci, and it will do the same for many thousands more. Please share the Huckleberry Hiker with anyone you know who needs it. If you know people at nonprofits or companies that serve the adaptive community, please reach out to us through this campaign so we can get in touch.

If you need assistance with Environmental Resource Permits, scroll to the bottom of this page and select from the Contacts & Locations menu. An Environmental Resource Permit is required for development or construction activities to prevent flooding, protect the water quality of Florida's lakes and streams from stormwater pollution, and protect wetlands and other surface waters. The South Florida Water Management District regulates residential and commercial developments, roadway construction and agriculture; while the Florida Department of Environmental Protection oversees power plants, ports, wastewater treatment plants and single-family home projects. This type of permit is needed for: Dredging and filling in wetlands or surface waters Constructing flood protection facilities Providing storm water containment and treatment Site grading Building dams or reservoirs Other activities affecting state waters For assistance with RegPermitting, please contact the RegPermitting Hotline at (561) 682-2281 or regpermitting@sfwmd.gov . ERP General Permit for Small Projects: Self-Certification for \"10-2\" Permit Section 403.814(12) of the Florida Statutes grants general permits for the construction, alteration and maintenance of a stormwater management system serving a project that involves qualifying activities in uplands having less than 10 acres of total project area and less than two acres of impervious surface. This general permit requires submittal of an \"electronic self-certification\" before construction begins. The \"electronic self-certification\" requirement can be satisfied through use of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) self-certification portal at www.fldepportal.com/go . While use of DEP's portal is not required by Florida law, it is available as a convenience to all qualifying entities, regardless of whether notice of the activity normally would be submitted to a water management district (WMD), the DEP or a delegated local government. Use of the DEP portal ensures that the certification will be received in a timely manner, directed to appropriate staff within the DEP, WMD and local government and automatically archived. It also will provide you with confirmation that DEP received the certification, which you may print and retain for your records. You may submit an alternative electronic certification directly to the applicable agency, in accordance with the Operating Agreements in effect between DEP, the WMDs and delegated local governments. However, if you do, you assume all risks that your alternative notice is sent to the correct agency and that it meets all the provisions of s. 403.814(12), F.S. There are three types of ERP's: General Permits, Conceptual Approval Permits, and Individual Permits. General Permits and smaller Individual Permits are authorized by District staff. Individual Permits for a project area over 100 acres, or with more than 10 acres of wetland impacts, or more than 30 boat slips are issued by the District's Executive Director. See Chapter 62-330, F.A.C., Applicant's Handbook Volume I and Applicant's Handbook Volume II for a complete discussion of the ERP program, including forms. Additionally, a General Permit under subsection 403.814(12), F.S. is available for qualifying activities in uplands having less than 10 acres of total project area and less than two acres of impervious surface. This general permit requires submittal of an \"electronic self-certification before construction begins. The \"electronic self-certification\" requirement can be satisfied through use of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) self-certification portal at www.fldepportal.com/go . In reviewing your application, we are required to weigh whether the proposed activity will, among other things: Cause adverse flooding to on-site or off-site property Cause adverse water quality and quantity impacts Cause adverse impacts to wetlands, fish or wildlife Adversely affect public health, safety and welfare Impair navigation or surface water flows Adversely affect nearby fishing or recreational uses If your proposed activities would impact wetlands, you will be asked to compensate for those impacts by preserving, restoring, enhancing or creating wetlands either on your property or at an appropriate off-site mitigation location, or by purchasing credits from a mitigation bank. Monitoring of mitigation wetlands is required to ensure their survival and ability to replicate functions of natural wetlands. See Section 10.0 of the ERP Applicant's Handbook Volume I for more information.

The Legislative intent is to ensure conformity with the approved plans and specifications and to protect the public health and safety, and the natural resources of the state. The Environmental Resource Compliance (ERC) Bureau is tasked with providing compliance and enforcement services relating to both permitted and non-permitted projects. Some of the services provided include: Pre-construction meetings Construction inspections of permitted projects Review of Construction Completion Certifications Environmental mitigation and monitoring Investigation and resolution of public complaints Surveillance for unpermitted works Enforcement actions including documentation, notification and resolution Above Ground Impoundment Program Operable Structure Program Coordination with local governments Emergency Management coordination and response Related Documents : Environmental Monitoring Guidelines [PDF] Compliance Coverage Area Map [PDF] Sovereign Submerged Lands If a proposed activity involves work in adjacent water bodies (e.g., Intracoastal Waterway, Lake Okeechobee), SFWMD will generally request a title determination from the State of Florida about claim to the submerged lands. If the State claims title to the submerged lands, the District will also process any required authorizations from the State of Florida for use of the submerged lands. These authorizations can include consents of use, easements and leases; and must be processed concurrently with the ERP application.

Project specifics will be discussed during the meeting, and staff will answer questions and inform applicants what information is required to be submitted in order to complete the application process. To schedule a meeting, please contact us by email at wupreapp@sfwmd.gov or call (561) 682-2795. If you have any questions or require assistance regarding Well Construction Permitting or Well Contractor Licensing, please contact us at wells@sfwmd.gov or (561) 682-6930. A consumptive water use permit allows the holder to withdraw a specified amount of water from the ground ( aquifers ) or a canal, lake or river (surface water) for reasonable-beneficial uses. The water can be used for public supply (drinking water), agricultural and nursery plant irrigation, golf course irrigation, commercial use, dewatering/mining activities and power. Water uses not covered by these permits include domestic uses, home irrigation and water used for fire fighting. Consumptive water use permits require water conservation to prevent wasteful uses, such as the reuse of reclaimed water (treated wastewater). The permits also set limits on how much water can be withdrawn at each location in the aquifer or from surface water. These limits protect existing residents' water supplies and protect aquifers from saltwater intrusion damage, and surface water sources from drying up. Once a consumptive water use permit is issued by the District, SFWMD water use compliance staff monitor the use of water to make sure the permit's limiting conditions are met. Scientists and environmental analysts evaluate pumpage and monitoring data (chlorides, water levels, turbidity, etc.), and other compliance reports such as calibrations, wetland monitoring, unaccounted for water loss and 10-year compliance, and respond to instances of non-compliance. On-location site inspections also help determine compliance and document project activities, withdrawal facilities, and unpermitted uses of water. For assistance with RegPermitting, please contact the RegPermitting Hotline at (561) 682-2281 or regpermitting@sfwmd.gov .

Issues addressed during the application evaluation process are: Is the proposed use reasonable and beneficial as defined in Section 373.019 of the Florida Statutes? Will it interfere with other water users in the vicinity? Is it consistent with the public interest (including harm to the environment, saltwater intrusion, wetlands, movement of pollution, etc.)? Consumptive water use permits are issued for a fixed period of time, and must be renewed prior to the expiration date in order to continue using water.

Harry’s Field is a family orientated, smaller campsite with proper flushing toilets and showers. It is in the centre of a village, with a pub next door and a village cafe nearby. There are walks and cycle rides from the gate and ponies and their foals surround the campsite. Harry’s Meadow is set in the stunning grounds of a stately home with huge views and spectacular sunsets. There is plenty of room for all to spread out and for adults to tuck themselves away from families if they prefer. There is a village shop and excellent pub within short walking distance, walks and cycle rides from the gate and wild swimming spots nearby. The Old Airfield is in the heart of the New Forest. A spacious campsite with big skies, near the most wonderful beaches, family orientated but large areas set aside for Adult only camping.

Harry’s Field All pitches are pre-allocated so please let us know at the time of booking if you are camping with friends. We will try to pitch you together. We do not allow large groups. ​ Our other two campsites – Harry’s Meadow and The Old Airfield – do not offer pre-allocated tent pitches, as the campsites are very large. You can choose where you would like to pitch. Do you have electric hook-ups? We are sorry but there are no electric hook-ups at any of our campsites. At Harry’s Field only, there are plenty of sockets in the communal kitchen (where you can charge your phones and blow-up your air beds if need be).
