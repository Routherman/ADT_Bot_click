A unique, spacious structure, the Brecksville Burntwood Tavern was at one time a general store in the front with a small dance hall located in the upstairs loft. A half-court basketball court even existed where the dining room currently stands. History is paramount at this Tavern. In the bar, you'll find a huge walk-in fireplace built from stones misplaced during the construction of the Ohio Canal as well as two arches that run along the north wall that hailed from the former School House #6.  Beautiful chandeliers and another huge stone fireplace set the mood for dining. Our guests can still see that trees that originally existed on the property; the dining room is adorned with hand-carved Chestnut beams made in the 1930’s from these native Brecksville trees. Legend has it, the original owner of this historic building has not left, and over the years staff have reported hearing their names called out and being touched on the shoulders by someone … or something. Complimented by hand blown glass light fixtures and our signature copper top bar, the Brecksville Burntwood Tavern is an amazing space to relax with one of our many craft beers on draught, while beautiful chandeliers and another huge stone fireplace set the mood for dining. Burntwood Insider Fact: The Brecksville Burntwood Tavern is located on Route 21, which at one time was the major north-south thoroughfare connecting Cleveland with southern Ohio.

After much anticipation and more than a year of planning, Burntwood Tavern has opened to rave reviews at the Fort Myers Bell Tower Shops, in the space previously occupied by Cru. It joins Burntwood’s other Southwest Florida locations at Naples’ Mercato and at the Gulf Coast Town Center in the former Bar Louie. As diners are discovering, it was well worth the wait. The décor of the newest restaurant is rustic but sophisticated. Reclaimed wood from old barns is used throughout, and wooden wheel-shaped chandeliers with handblown glass hang from the ceiling. The indoor/outdoor copper-top bar has slide-up garage doors, and connects to the shopping center walkway, acting as a magnet to passersby. Inside and out, it’s beautiful, spacious and best of all, fun. Often, there is live music, along with one of the best Happy Hours in town. Burntwood is a chef-driven restaurant serving American tavern food. “I grew up in the kitchen, and having a from-scratch kitchen is important,” says founder Bret Adams . Each restaurant has a smoker, and some are outside for that backyard party feel. The restaurant uses the smoker for a variety of meats on the menu. The Smoked Pork sandwich has layers of pickled vegetables for a bit of acid and jalapeno cilantro aioli to add a hit of heat bursts with flavor and flare. The Smoked Prime Rib is used to make a hearty chili and is also the star of the meaty Tavern Dip sandwich, a restaurant favorite with horseradish sauce and savory au jus. Most prominently featured on the menu are Burntwood’s carefully crafted sandwiches. The signature Burntwood Burger, with its creative combination garnishes is incredibly filling. The savory beef patty topped with applewood smoked bacon, hash browns, a fried egg, American cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and pickles is a one-of-akind item. Other sandwiches include the meatless Beyond Burger, Panko- Crusted Grouper, Grilled Chicken, and Beer-Battered Cod. The cod is Burntwood’s version of classic fish & chips. The entrée comes with a side of jalapenospiked tartar sauce, coleslaw, and hand-cut fries, prepared daily and fried to perfection. Similarly, the tater tots are hand-rolled, spiderlike shredded potatoes that are breaded and fried at the time of serving. Several sauces accompany Burntwood’s potatoes: chipotle BBQ, ranch, and remoulade, to make the menu item even tastier. At lunch, the restaurant offers a convenient place to choose any two specials or create a combo of soup, salad, or half of a sandwich. Burntwood wouldn’t be a Southwest Florida staple without the variety of seafood selections. The menu boasts a rich and creamy Lobster Bisque, Blackened Shrimp Tacos , and Firecracker Shrimp served with a cooling side of ranch dressing. For bigger appetites, the Cedar Plank Salmon is one of the most ordered items. In the spring, the Soft-Shell Crab is wildly popular. The menu specials change seasonally, and include summer grilling or the fall’s Mexican fiesta. For customers with a sweet tooth, the brownie sundae is a must. It comes out warm, topped with vanilla bean gelato and drizzled with hot fudge. Huge and priced at just $5, it’s truly amazing. The Happy Hour menu offers unique items, such as pretzels dusted in ancho chili with jalapeno queso, potato skins with that delicious smoked pork and Buffalo BBQ sauce, Nashville hot chicken sliders, Sicilian flatbread, and more, ranging from $5 to $7. The drink specials include $3 bottles of beer, $4 drafts, $5 house wine, and $6 signature cocktails. On Thursday, all mules on the menu are only $5. The bar has numerous signature cocktails, many of which feature house-infused vodka and bourbon. One of the most popular drinks, Jack & Jill , mixes muddled blueberries with freshly squeezed lemon juice and blueberry-infused vodka. The strawberry lemonade combines strawberry and lemon infused in vodka to create the ultra-refreshing cocktail classic. Another staple is Burntwood’s Manhattan with cherry and maple-infused in bourbon. Drink specials are particularly popular during brunch at Burntwood, when mimosas are bottomless and only $9. Brunch is so successful that it’s not limited to just Sunday but also served on Saturday. The brunch menu includes fluffy omelets, thick Belgium waffles, and other breakfast classics, but the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich is a must. It’s loaded with chicken, gouda cheese, eggs over medium, and hash browns, and dressed in fresh arugula and Roma tomatoes. As Burntwood’s presence continues to grow in Southwest Florida, so does the establishment’s commitment to the community. “Giving back is an important part of who we are. We believe in partnering with charitable organizations and schools in our communities to help enhance the area for our guests and our neighbors,” says Jen Leonard, Burntwood’s director of marketing and events. Now open in the Bell Tower Shops in south Fort Myers, Burntwood Tavern has three Southwest Florida locations. Hours: Sunday-Thursday from 11:00 am-9:00 pm and Friday- Saturday from 11:00 am-10:00 pm. Saturday and Sunday brunch from 11 am-3 pm. Full liquor bar with Happy Hour drink specials from 3:00 pm – 6:00 pm daily. Private dining is available, and large parties can be accommodated.

      "text": "One Daytona lands new eatery, Burntwood Tavern News Sports Entertainment Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals EMPLOYMENT One Daytona lands new eatery, Burntwood Tavern Clayton Park clayton.park@news-jrnl.com DAYTONA BEACH — An Ohio restaurant chain is bringing its mix of “classic tavern food” and “modern American cuisine” to One Daytona . Chef Art Pour Restaurant Group signed a multi-year lease to open one of its Burntwood Tavern restaurants here next year, possibly in time for the start of Speedweeks in early February, confirmed Bret Adams, the chain’s founder and CEO. “We’d love to be open in time for the first race,” said Adams. NASCAR, the developer of the One Daytona complex across the street from Daytona International Speedway, also announced that three other tenants will be opening in the next few months, including Sunglass World, Whim Wham Art Studio and Chase Bank. The planned 5,200-square-foot Burntwood Tavern restaurant will fill a street-level space beneath The Daytona Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel , on the south side along Victory Circle. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. The restaurant will employ 80 workers and will be the Burntwood Tavern chain’s fifth in Florida and 15th overall. Adams opened his first Burntwood Tavern restaurant in 2010 in Chagrin Falls, just outside Cleveland. Today, the chain has 10 locations in the Cleveland area. In Florida, the chain currently has locations in Naples and Orlando. Two more are set to open in Fort Myers by January 2020, Adams said. The restaurateur said he had never been to Daytona Beach until three months ago when his Realtor for Florida recommended the fast-growing area as a potential expansion site. “When we drove by Daytona racetrack, my first reaction was ‘holy crap,’” Adams said of the enormous size of the 2.5-mile-long Daytona International Speedway. One Daytona is the 300,000-square-foot entertainment/retail/dining complex that NASCAR has been developing across the street to complement the motorsports stadium which it also owns. NASCAR’s goal in developing One Daytona, as well as redeveloping the adjacent Shoppes at One Daytona, is to combine them with the Speedway to create a year-round attraction for both visitors as well as locals even when races are not being held. “We looked at a couple other sites in Daytona, too, but we thought One Daytona was a great opportunity for us. It just felt right,” Adams said. Burntwood Tavern will offer indoor and outdoor seating for more than 200 customers at a time. It will also offer a distinctive rustic look, with the interiors made from reclaimed wood from old barns in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The restaurant will be open for lunch and dinner seven days a week as well as brunch on weekends. Its menu features what Adams described as “chef-driven tavern food with everything made from scratch.” Dishes include Harvest Chicken Salad, Cedar Salmon, Tavern Steak and Frites, tacos, steaks and Burntwood burgers. It also offers a Bloody Mary Bar on weekends. Its full-service bar serves a wide selection of craft beers, including the chain’s own BWT Signature Taberna IPA, signature cocktails including infused pear, blueberry and raspberry vodka drinks, and wines. Burntwood Tavern offers happy hour specials seven days a week, from 3 to 6 p.m. Adams described Burntwood Tavern as a “middle of the road” restaurant in terms of price, with dishes ranging from $10 to the mid-$20s. “We’re an upgrade from an Applebee’s and a downgrade from Fleming’s (Steakhouse). We’re the great alternative,” he said. At One Daytona and the Shoppes at One Daytona, Burntwood Tavern joins a collection of restaurants that already includes P.F. Chang’s, Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery, MidiCi Italian Kitchen, the Sir Malcolm restaurant inside The Daytona hotel, Built Custom Burgers, Miami Grill & Bar, First Watch, Dahlia Mexican Kitchen, Jersey Mike’s Subs, and restaurants inside GameTime and Cobb Daytona Luxury Theatres. Set to open in either December or January is a 4 Rivers Smokehouse that will take the place of the Oklahoma Joe’s Bar-B-Cue restaurant that closed at One Daytona in May. L. Gale Lemerand, the chairman and majority owner of the Daytona Beach-based Stonewood Grill & Tavern chain, said he is somewhat familiar with the Burntwood Tavern chain, whose Orlando location on Dr. Phillips Boulevard was previously a Stonewood restaurant. “I’m not concerned,” Lemerand said. “Competition is good. I have a lot of respect for (NASCAR executive vice chair) Lesa France Kennedy and (Kennedy’s uncle) Jim France (chairman and CEO of NASCAR). I think One Daytona’s going to continue to be successful. “I know they’ve had some turnover (at One Daytona), but it’s going to get better and better.” Adams said he has made it a trademark for his Burntwood Tavern restaurants to become involved in the communities they serve including supporting area schools and nonprofits as well as sponsoring events to benefit military veterans and first-responders. “We’ll be actively involved in paying it forward,” he said. NASCAR also announced several other tenant signings. Whim Wham Art Studio will be opening in early November, filling a storefront space beneath The Daytona hotel that was previously occupied by Kilwin’s Chocolates. Juetta West, a seasonal store that sells women’s fashion apparel, will be returning on Nov. 20, reopening in the storefront unit it previously occupied for several months earlier this year along Daytona Boulevard. Sunglass World will be opening along Victory Circle later this year, filling a storefront unit beneath The Daytona hotel, next door to Whim Wham. At Shoppes at One Daytona, a Chase bank branch is set to open by year’s end on the corner of West International Speedway and Bill France boulevards.
