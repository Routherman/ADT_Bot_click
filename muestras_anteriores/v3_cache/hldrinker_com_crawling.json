Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover the restaurant industry. Follow Author Mar 05, 2020, 08:59am EST Mar 05, 2020, 09:27am EST Share Save This article is more than 5 years old. An outlet of Hook & Reel in Fayetteville, N.C., a fast-growing seafood chain. Courtesy of Hook & Reel Launched in Lanham, Maryland in 2013 by Tony Wang, Hook & Reel is hooking in franchisees faster than a fisherman can haul in shrimp. It currently has 23 locations—all franchised, but by the end of March, it will proliferate to 28 locations. It specializes in Cajun/Creole seafood, so the food is spicy and tangy and catching on with a variety of customers. Its ownership vows that it will add 40 to 50 locations by the end of 2020. In this year alone, it has already debuted three new outlets in Philadelphia, the Bronx and Denver. In fact, it’s opening three in Brooklyn in 2020 on Flatbush Avenue, Albee Square downtown, and in the Georgetown neighborhood. Its three most popular entrees are: seafood boil, where guests build their own meal; po’ boys including fish, oyster, shrimp or chicken, and chicken wings. The typical dinner check is around $20 per person. One Yelp customer who dined at the original Latham location said, “Great place to get some down and dirty seafood. I love that you can make your own combo and get exactly what you want.” Another guest described the food at Hook & Reel as “classic Cajun boil style including crayfish, shrimp, and mussels, all steamed or boiled in your choice of sauces. Nothing unique but they do a good job of it.” Most of its outlets are spacious, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 square feet and accommodating 140 to 320 guests. Here’s what Lee Lin, Hook & Reel’s managing partner, at its Flushing, Queens headquarters, said about its growth: MORE FOR YOU Hook & Reel is expanding quickly? Why? Lin: Three are a few reasons. 1. Our CEO Tony Wang and our team of managing partners has been focused on the extending the business; 2. Because the sales are very good, we constantly have franchisees contacting us; 3. We screen franchisees so that they have restaurant experience as previous owner or personally managed a restaurant. Customers receive disposable bibs and gloves. Why? Lin: With the bibs, they wear them so they don’t destroy their clothing. They wear the gloves so they can dig into the seafood. It’s down and dirty. It also helps people to put down their phone and engage in real conversation with friends. What is Cajun seafood exactly? Lin: With our Cajun seafood, it’s authentic but not authentic. It’s more about the spices. When we created the concept, we went to New Orleans and California to explore unique concepts. We use several Cajun spices including paprika, lemon pepper and cayenne pepper. How are you attracting so many franchisees? Lin: Honestly, people come to us because they heard great things about us or they’re dining in one of our restaurants. Last week, we had five franchise requests from our website. Are most franchisee multiple owners? Lin: They own one location and they have to run the locations by themselves. When you manage multiple locations, you get distracted. It’s better to own your own restaurant and run it. If you run 10, it’s like a private equity firm, and they don’t care. Describe the training they receive at Hook & Reel. Lin: They come to one of our flagship stores and train in a variety of capacities as a manager, cashier, server, and bartender. They learn the business from every possible angle. Who’s the target audience who dines at Hook & Reel? Lin: Our target audience is mostly people from age 25 to 45, who are active socially, and often come after work and also come for celebrations, and families. too. You’re slated to open 40 or 50 locations by the end of 2020. Isn’t that rapid expansion? Lin: One of the true reasons of how we’re expanding so quickly is we have ongoing support on our corporate team. Once they’re trained, it’s a lot better to open the store themselves. They’re trained well, and they already had restaurant experience. What’s the trap in growing so fast? Lin: Many restaurant franchises fail because the owner wasn’t there. If you invest a million dollar in a restaurant, would you let it fail? Probably not. You’d be there every day and leave as late as possible and do your best. If you have that, the odds are you won’t fail. Role of delivery? Lin: Right now, we have a few locations that are testing out third-party vendors. We want to see how frequently people order take-out, whether it’s $200 a day or $300, and whether it’s worth it or not. Describe your three keys to success. Lin:1. The locations we choose. All the locations are only top locations, near shopping centers or in cities; 2. Our corporate team, including management, real estate, and training teams, help the franchisees successfully open restaurants, 3. We want to create a job environment where employees are part of the brand, can be authentic and happy to work here, and make Hook & Reel a great place to work.

Great work is crafted through iteration—through rapid changes driven by differing perspectives. And so Hook is a company organized around the idea that small, diverse, and versatile teams create better work, because they iterate more quickly and more often. Our teams of 20 are formed from an interdisciplinary mix of artists, creatives, engineers, and producers. Individuals from different levels and disciplines working together and investing equally in both the “thinking” and “making” of effective campaigns, content, and experiences. 100+ people, 100+ perspectives Half of us have tattoos, a quarter are parents, thirteen were top of their class in high school. Thirty of us speak more than one language, seventeen were the first in our family to graduate college. In the past, we’ve been cooks, farmers, camp counselors, mechanics, waiters, and cashiers. Some of us did internships in advertising, some of us worked at Olive Garden. Most of us can play a musical instrument. Ten have declared “history” as their best trivia category. One of us insists that making dolphin clicky noises with their mouth counts as a hidden talent. All of us are working to build a company where everyone can belong. We're working to be your favorite agency Work quality is critical and its success is entwined with our own. Yet, in our experience, what’s most important are the people who do the work and the experience they have along the way. We want our clients to think of us as the most trusted agency they’ve ever worked with. We want people in the industry excited to join us.

Message us and mention this article to take part. You can also go for our “ One amazing piece of content ” offer – same terms apply!. At structured networking events such as BNI, NRG or Athena, we regularly do “60 Second” speeches about our business. Ideally this includes who we are, what we do, how we add value, and of course, what time of business we are looking for. Many people/businesses also have a “hookline” – a sort of tagline which is said at the end of the little speech. Ours is “Top Left Design – Improve your presence online” – which rhymes and says what we do! The great thing about memory hooks is that they help you be remembered – just what we need in today’s competitive world! Keren had an educational slot to do about this topic – and of course did proper research! Much of this was found through the founder of BNI – Dr. Ivan Misner and a BNI website www.memoryhook.com. What makes a good memory hook? it has to be easy to remember. It should be short and snappy Don’t include anything you don’t need. Really Bad Memory Hooks Here are some examples of REALLY bad memory hooks – they just don’t work! Travel Discounts on cruises, vacation packages and honeymoons for all BNI members & their referrals. Telecom One stop shop telecommunications provider for voice and internet services for the small to mid size business. Tier one Internet provider with local customer service. Telecom Gemson Wolman was founded in 1990 on the principle that everyone deserves access to advanced communications services, regardless of where they choose to live. Telecom OnLink is a full-service telecommunications provider offering Local, Long Distance and Internet communications to both business and residential customers. Property Rated #1 by an independent Lab. Property Our service makes the difference! Tips to help – from the book “ Seven Second Marketing by Dr. Ivan Misner “ Use some of the 5 senses – A good memory hook often appeals to the basic senses – sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch. “For balloons with a flair, remember the bear in the air.” – Balloons “Come fly away with me.” – Travel agent “If you want to get rubbed the right way, see Jim.” – massage therapist (who’s name is Jim) Use humour This is an important sense for memory hooks –and a great way to make it memorable – the sense of humour! “Making people laugh is one of the fastest ways of breaking down the barriers between strangers and of winning the prospect’s good will.” Everything we touch turns to SOLD – Property Keep in touch so you don’t miss much – Telecoms We won’t hit you but we will get you hits. – SEO company Use puns or word play “We check your shorts,” – Electrician “Be true to your teeth or they will be false to you,” Dentist Use your name: Bob Howe, a mortgage lender, says, “Know Howe to get your next loan!” “Put a little Joy in your next event” – an event organiser called Joy “Remember don’t let your profits slips, think of Mark Day with the titanium hips” – Office equipment supplier Use Rhyme: “When the cops are in the foyer, call Frank, your friendly lawyer.” “Top Left Design – improve your presence online!.” Use parody Parody means a song or a phrase the reader or listener will recognize. But you have to be careful – some authors, especially songwriters, are quite militant about copyright infringement. “I believe in the tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth, so help me God.” – Dentist Double Reverse This is a statement in which the second part either rephrases or reverses the first. “A business without a sign is a sign of no business” – Sign company “Get a life, get a life coach” – life coach You can mix and match These approaches should give you an idea of some of the tools and resources you can use to construct your own memory hook. Notice that many memory hooks use a combination of these techniques. Almost anything you do in the line of word play will come out funny—and that’s the way it should be, unless you’d rather appeal to the heart. Song lyrics usually rhyme, so if you parody a song, it should rhyme as well. And any of these techniques can be more effective if your memory hook is short and snappy and appeals to the senses. Below is a selection of the memory hooks we found on the website memory hook.com – and we have categorised them based on the above concepts. Hopefully this helps when you have to think of yours.

Share: Article url copied This week we sat down with MacInnes Whisky director and founder Jonathan Hook . Jon’s a philanthropist, qualified accountant and financial adviser with worldwide experience in the finance industry for the last 35 years. In this article he discusses navigating the challenges of the whisky cask market and growing a whisky investment business. With there being some bad press around whisky cask investments over the last few years, what do you say to people who are perhaps apprehensive of investing in cask whisky, and what does MacInnes do to protect their customers and their customer’s investments? JON: Well firstly, at MacInnes Whisky we own all our casks. That’s hugely important and we will never say we own a cask that we don’t hold an invoice for. Once the customer pays for their cask they will receive a certificate and that will represent ‘beneficial ownership’ of said cask. We hold onto the delivery order (although we can provide the customer with a copy) and we are the customers' nominees for that cask. We then store the casks in a WOWGR licensed bonded warehouse which is HMRC registered. By doing it this way, the customer can enjoy the tax free benefits that can make whisky investment so lucrative. How safe is a cask whisky investment and why do you think so many people are googling ‘is whisky investment a scam’? JON: At MacInnes Whisky we ensure every single warehouse in which our casks are stored is WOWGR registered with HMRC. There is also a nominal charge per annum for the casks to be insured against any perils that may threaten the cask. In terms of whisky scams? Being a registered accountant and having my own firm, I have a reputation to uphold. Sounds crazy but there are sharks and charlatans out there that will sell you a cask that simply doesn’t exist, or at the very least isn’t what it says on the tin. That’s not how we operate and our reputation is paramount. We would much rather sell less and sell only the very best. What are the exit options, should an investor need to free up their money? At MacInnes we are happy to help facilitate the sale of your cask for a commission or put you in touch with others in the industry who might be interested in purchasing your cask. We have connections to private investors, bottlers, and even distilleries looking to buy back rare casks or casks of a particular vintage. Of course, it goes without saying that the older the cask, the better chance you have of selling it quickly. A bit like classic cars, the market price for whisky can vary on any given day. What is the true value of your cask? Well, like all things, it’s whatever someone is willing to pay for it, but on average, branded single malt scotch has a much better return than other whiskies out there and that’s why we specialise in it. And as investment options go, whisky does continue to stand firm, even in the recent tumultuous economic climate. Even at our lower estimate of a 12% return, if you consider that that is tax free, then it’s already a better return than many investment options out there. In general, whisky should be considered a long term investment. We don’t suggest customers put away more money than they can comfortably live without and of course, the longer the investment, the better chance there is for those more substantial returns. How does an investor know their whisky cask exists? JON: The delivery order is the unequivocal proof that the cask exists. That’s what we show the customer and present to the warehouse. As I mentioned before, as the ‘owners’ of the cask, we hold onto this as it’s only by doing so that our customers can enjoy the benefits of their whisky cask being excise free. We have also been exploring the idea of having customers come and visit their casks and drawing some of the ‘angel share’ and taking it away with them to enjoy; creating that whole experience, if you will.  It was tough to do this during Covid, but it’s definitely in our plans for the future. What is a WOWGR licence and do I, the customer, need one? JON: A WOWGR licence stands for ‘Warehousekeepers and Owners of Warehoused Goods Regulations’ and we hold a WOWGR licence so you don’t need to. This licence entitles MacInnes Whisky to hold spirituous liquids in duty suspension i.e. a bonded warehouse. It's not easy to obtain a WOWGR licence, so it’s important that you buy from a reputable company such as MacInnes Whisky that has one. Without the licence you will be highly unlikely to find a warehouse to hold your cask and if you were able, then you’d potentially be liable to criminal sanctions. It’s a heavily regulated business. What made you, a qualified accountant of 35 years, choose to invest your own money in whisky over some of the other investment options out there? I liked the fact that it was something different. Up until recently whisky investment has been a closed shop, exclusive to those with hedge funds and country club memberships. We wanted to make it more obtainable and a viable investment option for all. During my many years as both an accountant and financial adviser, I’ve been helping my clients find ways to legally minimise their tax and enjoy tax free gains. Whisky has turned out to be a fantastic way of combining the passion I have for whisky with my knowledge of the financial industry. The combination of both is MacInnes’ USP and we’re proud of it. What would you say to someone who is considering a whisky investment but just isn’t sure it’s the right option for them? JON: The golden rule of financial advising is ‘don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’ as with any investment, your capital is at risk. I also never suggest anyone puts more money in than they can afford. It’s all about integrity really. I would much rather see someone put away a lesser amount of money and really allow that investment to blossom over time, than investing more than they can afford and having to sell their cask in a year or two. If you have been considering a whisky investment then I would urge you to get in touch with a member of the team and we can talk you through the process in more detail and start you on your journey.
