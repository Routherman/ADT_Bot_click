Sun Splash Family Waterpark in Cape Coral opens for the 2025 season this Saturday. The park will go to daily Spring Break hours of operation on March 14 through 30. In April and May, the park will operate Thursday through Sunday before going to daily summer hours on May 23 through Sept. 1. In the fall, the park will be open Friday through Sunday and weekends only in November, as well as the week of Thanksgiving excluding the 27th. “This year will be a game-changing season for Sun Splash as we introduce the all new Paradise Cove Wave Pool this summer,” said Chief Marketing Officer, Ron McKenzie. “This long-awaited attraction will make Sun Splash the place to be this summer.” The new Paradise Cove Wave Pool presented by Ryco Marine will open Memorial Day Weekend. It is located at the back section of the park near the three drop slides: Terror Tube, Thunder Bump, and X-Cellerator. “The wave pool was several years in the making as we partnered with the city of Cape Coral to make sure it was the best it could be,” said McKenzie. The 12,000 square foot wave pool will cater to all ages and provide features such as a zero-depth beach entry, adjustable wave patterns, additional shade and luxury cabanas, a wave pool video screen, interactive beachfront water features, and a new seating area and deck for more than 300 patrons. “Guests will be able to enjoy the wave pool in many ways, including just relaxing to the sound of waves or enjoying a movie on the large digital screen.” Season Passes are now on sale for $59.99 (limited time) with a 40% savings off of the regular price. Children age 2 and under are admitted free. Season Pass Perks include: unlimited visits, early entry, two free “buddy” tickets for a one-time visit, souvenir cup, discounts, and special events access. “The price is going up soon and it is the best way to enjoy the park with unlimited visits, in-park discounts and other great benefits,” McKenzie said. Sun Splash has a variety of special events taking place all season long. Season pass holders can access these events as well as park guests with a one-day admission ticket purchase. “Simply put, we listen to our guests and try to put together an event line up that appeals to all ages,” McKenzie said. Just a few of the special events at Sun Splash this season include: Spring Break Celebration (March 15 and 16), St. Paddy’s Day Celebration (March 16 and 17), Sunset at Sun Splash After-Hours (March 29 and April 12), Easter Eggstravaganza (April 19), Prince and Princess Day (June 21), Independence Weekend Celebration (July 4-6), Superhero Day (July 19), Spooky Splash Bash (Oct. 25), End of Season Christmas Celebration (Nov. 30). “We’re thrilled to welcome families and friends back to Sun Splash for another sun-filled season of excitement,” said Eric Reed, general manager of Sun Splash. “With the debut of our new Paradise Cove Wave Pool, an engaging lineup of special events, and unbeatable Season Pass deals, now is the perfect time to make Sun Splash your top choice for family fun.” For hours, birthday parties, details on special events, and to purchase season passes and one-day admission tickets, visit SunSplashWaterpark.com .

We do not knowingly collect PD from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our website, please contact us.

Our Security Policy We have built our website using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your PD. We and the third parties who provide services for us, also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your PD. When we collect your credit card information through our website, we will encrypt it before it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online transactions.

Transferring PD From the European Union (PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate, specifically the United States of America. The European Union has not found the United States and some other countries to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For European Union customers and users, with your consent, your PD may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States and or other countries. We will use your PD to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section. Changes to Our Privacy notice We reserve the right to change this privacy notice at any time. If our company decides to change this privacy notice, we will post those changes on our website so that our users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide to disclose or use your PD in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.
