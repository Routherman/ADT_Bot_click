The Gulf Harbour Yacht Club promotes the enjoyment, knowledge, and safety of boating through organized cruises and social functions.  Boating activities include extended cruises throughout Florida and monthly lunch cruises to various waterfront restaurants in the Ft. Myers area.  On the social front, club members meet monthly for a Boaters’ Night and again for a dinner meeting. Membership is required.
