Since 1992, Orlando Fringe has provided a space and opportunity for artists to emerge and showcase their talents and craft. The Orlando Fringe produces The Orlando International Fringe Theatre Festival , the longest-running Fringe in the United States, which strives to be unjuried, uncensored, accessible for artists and audiences alike, with 100% of ticket sales given back to the artists. It All Starts with a Festival For 34 years, we’ve hosted our annual international theatre festival. For two weeks each May, we offer loads of live entertainment, unique theatre experiences, visual art displays, kid friendly shows and activities, and free outdoor concerts. It's a full celebration of independent artists. It is the oldest Fringe Festival in the US and, with its lottery-based selection, offers a variety of experiences you won’t find anywhere else. Click here to learn more about our annual Fringe festival Over the years, we’ve grown and expanded to include a second annual festival, special events, educational programs, and so much more.

Orlando Fringe is a Safer Space Orlando Fringe is committed and strives to be a respectful, safer environment free from harassment, violence, discrimination, bullying, and abuse. All community members should be treated with respect and dignity. We provide opportunities for everyone to contribute and participate in all events and activities whenever possible. We will not tolerate participation in activities or behaviors that discriminate on the grounds of race, gender, age, marital status, religious beliefs, citizenship, mental and physical abilities, or sexual orientation. Land Acknowledgement Orlando Fringe acknowledges that our Festival resides on the traditional homelands and territories of the Seminole , Miccosukee , and Timucua Tribes. We are privileged to create here, and recognize that identifying inequities in our organization and working to change policies will support inclusive artistic expression for all. Amplifying Voices At Orlando Fringe, we believe in Amplifying Voices. Our goal is to assure that we are creating and fostering an inclusive, equitable, and collaborative environment, one that promotes participation and openly recruits diverse stories and performances, providing opportunities for underrepresented artists and communities by not only offering a platform for inclusive shows, art, and experiences, but by facilitating and creating opportunities for coaching, mentorship, and scholarships, and by offering any guidance that might help on their artistic journey. Ultimately, our greatest ambition is that artists and patrons of any background will see themselves represented in the work showcased at the Orlando Fringe Festival as well as all of our year-round events and that we might serve as a model and inspiration to other artists and arts organizations in our own community and around the world.
