They assist with the cake and decoration set-up, serve food and beverages during the time in the party room, and clean-up after your event is over. Who needs waivers and how do we sign?

The Elite Membership includes a $25 discount for the Basic Package or higher and the Elite+ Membership includes 5 FREE additional friends for the Basic Package or higher.

PRIVACY The Park’s privacy policy, which describes the Park’s information gathering and privacy practices, applies to the Monthly Membership Agreement and is incorporated in the Monthly Membership rules by this reference. By enrolling in the Monthly Membership, you agree to the terms of the Park’s privacy policy and the use of your personal information as set forth therein. GENERAL The Park reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify or update the Monthly Membership rules and/or change, alter, or discontinue the Monthly Membership (including its structure), the lists of participating parks, or any reward or special status programs at any time without any liability or notice to Members beyond updating these Monthly Membership rules. The result of such modification, update, change, alteration or discontinuation may include the decrease in redemption value or cancellation of credit not yet redeemed. All questions or disputes regarding an individual’s Monthly Membership eligibility, or a Member’s compliance with the Monthly Membership rules will be resolved by the Park in its sole discretion. Any Monthly Membership awarded to an individual, as well as any prize or gift provided to a Member, may be taxable, depending on the value of the item and the applicable federal, state, and local tax laws. Members and recipients of any price or gift are solely responsible for payment of any applicable taxes and any applicable tax reporting obligations. By signing the Monthly Membership you agree to release the Park, its parent(s), affiliates, divisions, related companies, third-party prize/reward providers and suppliers, and agents, and its and their respective officers, directors, owners, and employees, (each a “Releasee”) from any and all losses, harm, damages, cost, or expense, including without limitation property damages, personal injury, and/or death, arising from or connected to the Monthly Membership, including, without limitation, (i) the collection, redemption, revocation, or deletion of credits, (ii) the issuance of reward vouchers and use of the Monthly Membership, (iii) the suspension, termination, or modification of your Monthly Membership or account, (iv) entering the Park and/or use of the Park and its attractions, and (v) the suspension, modification, or termination of the Monthly Membership or any reward or special status programs therein. The Monthly Membership and its prizes, merchandise, sweepstakes and sweepstakes entries, products or services provided through the Monthly Membership are provided and must be accepted on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind. The Park, and its partners or administrators, and each of the foregoing’s respective agents or representatives make no representations or warranties, express or implied, and disclaim any and all liability as to the condition, quality, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose of products and/or services provided by or through the Monthly Membership including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and any warranty of non-infringement, title, or quiet enjoyment. Under no circumstances shall any of the Releasees be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in any way connected with the Monthly Membership or Members’ participation therein, including, without limitation, any Monthly Membership program prizes, merchandise, or services made available as part of the Monthly Membership. In any event, any liability of the Park arising in connection with the provision of Monthly Membership program or prizes will be limited to the approximate retail value of the applicable reward or prize. This limitation applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or other legal theory, even if the Releasee has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In the event some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, Releasees’ liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the extent permitted by law. By participating in the Monthly Membership, you waive any and all rights to bring any claim or action related to your participation in the Monthly Membership in any forum beyond one year after the first occurrence of the act, event, condition, or omission upon which the claim or action is based. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Releasees’ from all liabilities, claims, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise out of or are related to your violation of the Monthly Membership or the Park’s rules. Furthermore, you agree to reimburse the Park for any Monthly Membership program or prizes that were fraudulently obtained by you. The Monthly Membership rules are governed by the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws rules of any jurisdiction. Any dispute, claim or cause of action arising out of or concerning the interpretation or effect of the Member rules and/or your participation in the Monthly Membership except where prohibited, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. You agree to the personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, and venue of these courts. If any provision of the Monthly Membership rules is held unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or is so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render the Monthly Membership rules unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions. Any waiver by the Park of a breach of any provision of the Monthly Membership rules shall not operate as, or be construed to be, a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of the Monthly Membership rules. Failure by the Park to insist upon strict adherence to any provision of the Monthly Membership rules on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive the Park of the right to insist upon strict adherence to that provision or any other provision of the Monthly Membership rules.

So we’re here to answer all your questions. And if you’re not finding what you need here, feel free to call your local park for extra support. Are socks required to jump? Yes. We sell special SkySocks in the park as both a safety and cleanliness measure. And you get to keep them after! Because who wants to put on used socks, anyways? Can I reuse my SkySocks? Yes! Bring back your SkySocks to reuse on your next visit as long as they are in good condition. It’s probably a good idea to wash them first, though. What are your hours? Operating hours will vary by location and by day of week. Weekends (including Friday) are generally open for longer hours. Is there an age limit for admittance? All ages (young and old) are welcome at Sky Zone. Because limits aren’t really our thing. Can I leave a child unattended at a Sky Zone park? Children under the age of 13 cannot be left alone without parent or guardian supervision. Do you sell food and drinks? Yes! We have a variety of food, snacks and drinks available for purchase in case you need to refuel in between backflips or after soaring into the foam pit.

All you need is a Sky Zone Membership — but this isn’t the old-school trampoline park Membership you’re thinking of. This is so much better, trust us! Sky Zone was founded on the idea that a trampoline park Membership was the best way to bring families together, whether that’s by celebrating a birthday, getting out of the house on a rainy day or meeting up with friends for a weekend playdate. However, a Sky Zone Membership brings a lot more to the table than a basic trampoline park Membership. Let us explain why. For starters, becoming a Member is a great way to save a little cash and unlocks unlimited access to all the attractions at Sky Zone. We go way beyond a typical trampoline membership; a Sky Zone Membership, available in two different levels, means you’re getting the most from your Sky Zone experience. Forget what you thought you knew about a trampoline membership . Our Basic Memberships include Activity Time, Fuel Zone discounts and exclusive access to Members-only events. Elite Memberships include those great perks plus access to Sky Zone programs, party discounts and even special parent perks — because Sky Zone isn’t just for kids. It’s for everyone! If you’re interested in becoming a Member or want to know more about our Membership options, feel free to contact us or visit your local Sky Zone. Our friendly staff will be happy to assist you and answer any questions you may have. Members fly higher at Sky Zone, and you’ll experience it firsthand when you sign up. CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP Here’s everything you need to know/do to make changes to your membership plan. MANAGE MY MEMBERSHIP FAQ The last thing we want to do is leave you hanging. So we’re here to answer all your questions. And if you’re not finding what you need here, feel free to call your local park for extra support. Why should I sign up for a Membership? We love our Guests and believe it’s important to Play. Every. Day! So we created a monthly Membership program that allows access to Sky Zone whenever you want at a great value to you and your family!​ What is a parent add-on Membership? A parent add-on Membership can be applied to an Elite Membership so that a legal guardian can enjoy all the same benefits as their child for a low monthly price. The Parent Membership applies only to the original registered parent. Are there black out dates for the Membership? No! Your Membership can be used throughout the year. See park hours for our Open Jump times. Can I cancel anytime? Yes! The membership is month-to-month. Just give us a heads-up of at least 3 business days and we’ll process the cancellation.

FAQs The last thing we want to do is leave you hanging. So we’re here to answer all your questions. And if you’re not finding what you need here, feel free to call your local park for extra support. Who should I include as a Birthday jumper? Anyone who wants to jump and have access to the park.

Contact your event coordinator 48 hours prior to the party to add jumpers. Is the birthday child included in the count? Yes.

How old do I have to be to have my birthday at Sky Zone? All ages are welcome. When should everyone arrive for the party? All your guests will need to arrive 30 minutes prior to your party start time. This allows time for the entire group to get through check-in, verifying waivers and storing any personal items. What does the party host do? A lot. They ensure your room is set up with plates, cups, napkins and utensils. They assist with the cake and decoration set-up, serve food and beverages during the time in the party room, and clean-up after. Who needs waivers and how do we sign? All jumpers need a signed waiver. Waivers can be completed online before your party by clicking here . Can I add extra jump time? For. Sure. If your party is during the week you can add 30 minutes of jump time for $5 per jumper or 60 minutes of jump time for $9 per jumper to any of our party packages.
