MENU MENU Apparel Business Courses Equipment People Podcasts Jobs Search Close BAY POINT GOLF CLUB ACQUIRES NEW OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT Â April 5, 2021 Twitter Facebook Pinterest Email BP Linx, LLC purchases Panama City Beach golf club and selects Bobby Jones Links as management companyÂ Atlanta, GA â BP Linx, LLC, a company owned by a local Bay Point family, recently acquired ownership of Bay Point Golf Club, the only Nicklaus Design course in Northwest Florida, as well as Bar 72, the restaurant on the property. The announcement comes alongside BP Linx, LLC’s decision to select Atlanta-based club management company Bobby Jones Links as the new management company, a decision that went into effect with the purchase of the property on Thursday, April 1. “I’m looking forward to helping Bay Point Golf Club maintain its stellar reputation in the community while building on the already strong base it has,” said John Warren, a representative of BP Linx, LLC. “With their employee-centric culture and strong focus on member and guest service, I really believe Bobby Jones Links is the perfect partner to be able to achieve that.” Bay Point Golf Club, located just minutes from the sandy shores of Panama City Beach, provides a full golf experience to guests of all skills and interests on its championship course, The Nicklaus Course. The semi-private golf club, which offers memberships but also welcomes public play, is nestled in a 1,100-acre nature preserve and carved from Northwest Floridaâs natural terrain of scrub oaks, pines and saltwater marshes. It includes five sets of tees stretching from 4,100 to 7,100 yards and boasts recently renovated greens as well as new green-side bunkers. Bay Point Golf Club, a continued favorite course in the area, has also won a Readerâs Choice âBest of the Bayâ award every year since 2016. âBay Point Golf Club is such a unique place to play, and we couldnât be more honored to have been chosen to help continue to raise it to new levels,â said Steve Willy, a Co-Founder of Bobby Jones Links. “We are excited to work with BP Linx, LLC to bring an array of resources, expertise and new ideas to the table.” Along with its purchase of the property, BP Linx, LLC also acquired ownership of Bar 72, the restaurant attached to the Bay Point Golf Club clubhouse, marking the first time in years that the restaurant and golf club will have the same owner and management.
