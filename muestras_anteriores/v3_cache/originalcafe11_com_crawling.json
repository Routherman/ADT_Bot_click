Homestyle Deli CafÃ© In house or take away Since 2015 11 Queens Parade London W5 3HU 020 8991 1457 321 Upper Richmond Road West London SW14 8QR 020 8876 7203 HELLO! We are more than your normal coffee shop; we are a part of your everyday lives.  Our passion and love of home-cooked meal is portrayed in every dish we serve. Come and choose from our heartily and healthy all day brunch, sexy salads or good old fashioned specials with a taste of Persia.  We have excellent coffee, speciality teas and an array of freshly pressed juices and smoothies.  And last but by far not the least, we have freshly baked cakes which will put a smile on your face. OUR MENU Ealing East Sheen OUR STORY I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my home. After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests. CATERING SERVICES A voyage in the tastes and perfumes of the Silk Roadâ¦ Persia on a platter. Reinventing Persian family recipes with subtle and varied flavours for an exotic Persian taste. Whatever your special occasion, from family dinners to corporate events and galleries to weddings, we can cater to make a memorable experience for everyone involved. Just call us and we can discuss your needs to create a playful and elegant Persian feast. We can also bake a speciality cake for your occasion.  Let us know if you need a chef to assemble the canapes or if you need servers.  Everything is possible. Get In Touch Party Menu CanapÃ©s Menu Get In Touch OUR CAKES One of the best things about 11 Coffee & Co are the cakes that are baked by our wonderful baker with plenty of passion and love. We use only the best quality ingredients that you expect to find in home baked cakes. NO ADDITIVES NO PRESERVATIVES and NO COLOURING is the motto we live by. We also always try to have a gluten free and vegan option on display for those guests with special dietary requirements. If you need a whole cake or a bespoke homemade celebration cake, just get in touch to discuss your wishes. Mon-Fri: 7:30-17:00 Sat: 8:00-17:00 Sun & Public Holidays: 9:00-16:00 We are now closed!

We do ask that clothing be clean and presentable (no excessive rips, stains, or offensive graphics). For safety reasons, shirts and shoes are required at all times.

Excessive or unpleasant odors — whether from clothing, poor hygiene, or strong fragrances — may disrupt the dining experience for others. Freshly laundered clothing and use of deodorant are strongly encouraged. Please avoid wearing heavy perfumes, colognes, or sprays, as these may affect the comfort of nearby guests. Our goal is to create a welcoming environment for everyone. We ask that all attire and grooming reflect consideration for fellow diners. Guests who do not meet these standards may be respectfully asked to leave or return at another time. This is at the discretion of restaurant management and staff to ensure the comfort of all diners.
