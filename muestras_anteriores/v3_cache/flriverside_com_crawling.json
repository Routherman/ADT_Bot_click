Looking at the timeline below you can see how far the church has come since it was planted in 1925. Our history is really \"His-Story\", the story of God working in the lives of ordinary people over many decades. Our story continues today as we press into all that God has for us and for our community. We would love you to journey with us... This Is Us In the autumn of 2024, we did a series called This Is Us where we unpacked some ‘aspirational distinctives’ for Riverside - phrases describing both where we are now as a church, and also where we want to be… This list below isn’t exhaustive, but we believe it is an initial blueprint for the sort of church God has called us to be. It acts as a framework to evaluate our ministries, and puts language to describe the sort of church community we are trying to become… In our relationship with God, we try to be intimate, expectant, inspired and led. In our relationship with ourselves we believe we are loved, accepted, and being transformed by God. In our relationships with others, we try to be honest, authentic, and interdependent. In our sharing we try to be relevant, real, and good for everyone. In our outlook we try to be welcoming, loving, inclusive and safe. In our actions we try to be kind, generous, helpful, practical, and responsible. In our thinking we try to be open, always learning, and comfortable with questions. You can watch our This Is Us series on our YouTube channel here Since these are more easily ‘caught’ than ‘taught,’ we invite you to come along in person to get a feel for the kind of church we are. We always welcome questions, so do please come and chat to us. You can also read our Statement of Beliefs here Our History... The church began with meetings in this tent in 1925. The first church building was constructed in 1927 for just £554. The church grew and a new building was constructed in 1933. The factory site that is now home to Riverside church was purchased in 2014. Extensive refurbishment took place with the help of Martello Building Consultancy and construction company Jenner. We moved into our new facility in May 2016 thanks to the generosity of everyone who gave their finances and time to the project. Simon & Keely took over the leadership of the church from Chris & Angela Izzard on Sunday 19 June 2016. On May 13 2018 Riverside was adopted into the Vineyard Church movement and became Riverside Vineyard Church, Whitstable. In March 2022 Riverside completed its journey to become an affirming church.  At this point Riverside left the Vineyard movement and became an independent church once again. You can watch our journey through our All One series on our YouTube channel here A generous legacy enabled us to refurbish our lower lounge cafe space in February 2023. We converted the lower part of our building into a Youth Hub which we opened in September 2024.

Riverside is a movement of the Holy Spirit, called by God to make disciples by: Connecting people to God and each other through Jesus Christ. Impacting our community and our world with Christâs love. Empowering people to use their gifts to honor God. Sunday Worship Schedule 10AM Worship: Kid’s Sunday School and Nursery. Live Stream Worship 11:30AM AdoraciÃ³n: En persona y en linea More Information about us… What to expect in Worship Our goal in worship is not âa perfect eventâ our hope is you will feel that you can come as you are and will experience God and other people seeking to know God. You are welcome to come and see. The services are contemporary in style and relaxed. Children are always welcome to remain with their parents during worship.Â  We also have a “wiggle room” in the back of our sanctuary for parents who would prefer this option. We believe the people not the building are the church, we welcome all individuals who are seeking a relationship with Jesus Christ. We serve communion weekly in both services. All are welcome to the table who believe Jesus Christ is their Lord and Savior. We serve individual cups of grape juice with a wafer. Sunday Morning 10:00am – Worship and LIVESTREAM , Kid’s Sunday School and Nursery 11:30am -AdoraciÃ³n: En Persona y EN LINEA Where we meet We are located at 21631 Ridgetop Circle, Sterling, VA 20166.Â  We own Ridgetop Coffee and Tea and hope you enjoy a cup of coffee while checking us out! Our Mission in Action A movement of the Holy Spirit means that we do not seek to push a human or political agenda. We want to be part of what God is doing. Called by God to make disciples means that we believe that the way of selfless love that Jesus taught and lived is what leads us into the heart of God and the fullness of life that we were meant for. A disciple is merely one who commits to learning from Jesus and practicing the priorities of Jesus. Connecting people to God and each other means that we believe that every human being was created to be connected, connected to God and connected to others. Understanding who we are as a church is to understand that Riverside is about relationships and the grace God in Jesus brings to all of our relationships. Impacting our community and world with Christâs love means that we choose to be part of a movement of Godâs contagious goodness. We donât just learn about Christâs love, we seek to practice it and be of earthly good in our Sterling community and beyond. Empowering people to use their gifts means that we help each other discover and develop spiritual practices that give us life, as well as encourage and equip one another to serve and lead in the mission that God has given us in our everyday lives and in our corporate life together. To honor GodÂ means that we are not trying to build our own kingdom. We are not trying to see how big our church can get or to be the slickest church in town. We are seeking to be faithful to a God who deeply loves the world. We arenât perfect. But we are committed to finding our identity, our hope, and our future in the One who meets us in our imperfections and invites us into a holy adventure together, in this life and for eternity. What we practice We will practice room for one more.Â In a world that consistently seeks to keep âothersâ out (whomever gets defined as other), we seek to be a community that practices inclusion. There is always room for another chair at the dinner table. There is always room for another kid at camp. And there is always room for you, no matter where you are in life or what language you speak. We believe this reflects the Jesus who ate meals with sinners, welcomed children, and expanded the borders of Godâs love to all people. (John 17:18, Matthew 14:16, Acts 1:8) WE WILL STRIVE TO LIVE OUT LOVING AND GRACEFUL RELATIONSHIPS. In a world full of division, we seek to live out relationships that honor people and reflect Godâs grace. Because we are human, we will disappoint and disagree with one another from time to time. We are committed to working through inevitable conflicts in the way of Christâs reconciling love. That means we will go to those we have offended and to those who have caused us offense, and practice both honesty, confession, and forgiveness. (Matthew 5:23, Matthew 18:15, 1 Corinthians 13) Membership and Baptism We donât ask or require membership to be apart of our church family. We recognize no two paths are the same, our hope is that individuals and families grow in faith and become disciples of Jesus Christ whether you are lead to commit as a member or not. All are welcome. We ask those who want to make a public statement of Faith as a member of Riverside as their community to believe: –Â  The Mystery of the Trinity: God is mysteriously revealed to us in three different persons expressed as, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. –Â  The Incarnation in Jesus Christ: Jesus was fully God and fully human in some mysterious way that we humans may never fully understand but can only believe and receive by faith. If you want to know more about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, a member of Riverside, getting baptized, or any questions about our church community let us know we would love to connect you.
