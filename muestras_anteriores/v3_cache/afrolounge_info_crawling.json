John H. Murphy, Sr., a former enslaved man founded the AFRO 130 years ago with $200 from his wife, Martha Howard Murphy. Together they created a platform to offer images and stories of hope to advance their community. The AFRO provides readers with good news about the Black community not otherwise found. Two years before his death, Murphy in a letter to his sons further details the mission and purpose of the AFRO: “A newspaper succeeds because its management believes in itself, in God and in the present generation. It must always ask itself – Whether it has kept faith with the common people; Whether it has no other goal except to see that their liberties are preserved and their future assured; Whether it is fighting to get rid of slums to provide jobs for everybody; Whether it stays out of politics except to expose corruption and condemn injustice, race prejudice and the cowardice of compromise. The Afro-American must become a semi-weekly, then a tri-weekly and eventually when advertising warrants, a daily. It has always had a loyal constituency which believes it to be honest, decent and progressive. It is that kind of newspaper now, and I hope that it never changes. It is to these high hopes and goals of achievement that the people who make your AFRO have dedicated themselves. God willing, they shall not fail.” -John H. Murphy, Sr. Today the AFRO is led by 4th and 5th generation descendants of John H. Murphy Sr. With your much-needed support ( Thank you donors and members ), we can continue to bring news and information about the community for another 131 years and beyond, and in the immediate future keep our readers informed with our comprehensive COVID-19 coverage. The Afro-American has crusaded for racial equality and economic advancement for Black Americans for 131 years. In existence since August 13, 1892, John Henry Murphy Sr., a former slave who gained freedom following the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, started the paper when he merged his church publication, The Sunday School Helper with two other church publications, The Ledger (owned by George F. Bragg of Baltimore’s St. James Episcopal Church) and The Afro-American (published by Reverend William M. Alexander, pastor of Baltimore’s Sharon Baptist Church). By 1922, Murphy had evolved the newspaper from a one-page weekly church publication into the most widely circulated black paper along the coastal Atlantic and used it to challenge Jim Crow practices in Maryland. Following Murphy’s death on April 5, 1922, his five sons, each of whom had been trained in different areas of the newspaper business, continued to manage The Afro-American. Two of his sons, Carl and Arnett Murphy, served respectively as editor-publisher and advertising director. The Afro-American rose to national prominence while under the editorial control of Carl Murphy. He served as its editor-publisher for 45 years. The newspaper was circulated in Baltimore, with regional editions circulated in Washington, D.C. twice weekly and in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Newark, once a week. At one time there were as many as 13 editions circulated across the country. The Afro-American’s status as a black paper circulating in several predominantly black communities endowed it with the ability to profoundly affect social change on a national scale. “During World War II, The Afro-American stationed several of its reporters in Europe, the Aleutians, Africa, Japan, and other parts of the South Pacific, and provided its readers with first hand coverage of the war. ” Carl Murphy used the editorial pages of The Afro-American to push for the hiring of African Americans by Baltimore’s police and fire departments; to press for black representation in the legislature; and for the establishment of a state supported university to educate African Americans. In the 1930’s The Afro-American launched a successful campaign known as “The Clean Block” campaign which is still in existence today. The campaign developed into an annual event and was aimed at improving the appearance of, and reducing crime in, inner-city neighborhoods. The Afro-American also campaigned against the Southern Railroad’s use of Jim Crow cars, and fought to obtain equal pay for Maryland’s black schoolteachers. During World War II, The Afro-American stationed several of its reporters in Europe, the Aleutians, Africa, Japan, and other parts of the South Pacific, and provided its readers with firsthand coverage of the war. One of its reporters (and Carl Murphy’s daughter), Elizabeth Murphy Phillips Moss, was the first black female correspondent. The Afro-American collaborated with The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on numerous civil rights cases. In the 1950s the newspaper joined forces with the NAACP in the latter’s suit against the University of Maryland Law School for its segregationist admission policies. Their combined efforts eventually led to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision outlawing segregated public schools. The Afro-American also supported actor/singer Paul Robeson and sociologist W.E.B. DuBois during the anti-Communist campaigns of the Joseph McCarthy era. The Afro-American has employed many notable black journalists and intellectuals including Langston Hughes, William Worthy and J. Saunders Redding. In the mid 1930s it became the first black newspaper to employ a female sportswriter when it hired Lillian Johnson and Nell Dodson to serve on its staff. Renowned artist Romare Bearden began his career as a cartoonist at The Afro-American in 1936. ​Sam Lacy, who was hired as the paper’s sports editor in 1943 and who, at the age of 94, still wrote a weekly column for the paper, used his weekly ” A to Z” column to campaign for integration in professional sports. Using their writing to protest racial inequities in professional sports, Lacy and sports writers such as Wendell Smith of The Pittsburgh Courier helped to open doors for black athletes. Following the death of Carl Murphy in 1967, his daughter Frances L. Murphy II served as chairman and publisher. In 1974, John Murphy III, Carl’s nephew, was appointed chairman and eventually became the publisher. Fourth and fifth-generation members of the Murphy family, with leadership from Pastor Frances “Toni” Draper as Publisher & CEO  along with a governing board of family and community members, manage the paper in recent years.

In February 2018, she was named chairman of the board and publisher of the AFRO American Newspapers, which was founded in 1892 by her great-grandfather. She served previously as president of the company from 1987 to 1999. In 2002, She became the founding pastor of the Freedom Temple African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in south Baltimore. She received a Doctor of Ministry degree in preaching and leadership from the United Theological Seminary in Ohio in 2006. Her bachelor’s degree in Spanish language education in 1969 is from Morgan State University and served on the university’s Board of Regents for 24 years before stepping down last June. She also holds a master’s degrees in education, business administration and pastoral counseling. Her mother, Frances L. Murphy II , helped inspire her to be a community leader. She encouraged her to honor God, treat people the way you want to be treated and surround yourself with younger people who can keep you up to date on the latest trends and technologies. Now it’s her turn to inspire the younger generation. She often tells her grandchildren that it’s important to give back to the community because many people need a genuine hand up or a simple word of encouragement, in order to survive and thrive. When people are healthy economically, socially and spiritually, communities are healthy.

Alexis Taylor, Managing Editor Alexis Taylor, Managing Editor Our current editorial team is led by Alexis Taylor.  After serving the AFRO as editor for 10 years and managing editor for four years, Dorothy Boulware is stepping back from her role, leaving the reigns for Alexis Taylor, who currently serves as news editor. According to Boulware, “Taylor’s attention to detail is exactly what an editor needs to produce exceptional content across the media organization’s various platforms. Alexis has enough experience as a journalist and enough newness as a manager to be a great team leader in helping the AFRO hold its place as a Black Press star,” said Boulware. “She brings a type of reverence for history that makes her appreciate the archival treasure the AFRO adds to its news coverage and the ongoing story of Black people.” In her new role, Boulware will continue participating in media training labs and manage special projects and publications for the news organization. She admitted that she doesn’t think she will ever be finished with the AFRO. It’s been a part of her life since she was a young girl reading the newspaper at her grandmother’s dining room table. She promised to continue devising ways to best serve the Baltimore community, including finding local talent to fill the AFRO’s pages.

The report states that just 22,000 jobs were added to the economy in August. CNN reports that this number is far below economists’ expectations of roughly 76,500 new jobs. The unemployment rate also went up to 4.3%, from 4.2% in July. While still relatively low, this is the highest jobless rate since October 2021, per CNN. “After years of resilience, the U.S. job market looks increasingly fragile, especially after the latest numbers,” said CNN’s Matt Egan. Revisions to numbers from prior months reveal a weaker jobs trend than initially reported. According to Egan, June’s numbers shifted dramatically downward, from an initially reported gain of 14,000 to a loss of 13,000, marking the first monthly decline since December 2020. “That breaks nearly five years of uninterrupted job growth in the U.S. economy,”... read more 2 min Up next: Sign up for our daily Newsletter Follow the latest updates and news right in your mailbox Send Most Popular Watch Full Video IRS Confirms $1,390 Stimulus Checks For Millions Of Americans: Here’s Who Qualifies And When to Expect Them Chanelle Hayes Aug 15, 2025 21-Year-Old UNC Athlete Seth Trimble Used His NIL Earnings To Become The Youngest Ben & Jerry’s Franchise Owner Samantha Dorisca Sep 3, 2025 Venus And Serena Williams To Launch Program That Will Teach Under-Resourced Youth To Lead In The Boardroom Samantha Dorisca Sep 5, 2025 Marsai Martin Explains Why She Hasn't Touched Her Coogan Account, A Protected Savings For Child Performers Samantha Dorisca Sep 5, 2025 All About The Benjamins: How Diddy Set His Six Children Up For Financial Success Bernadette Giacomazzo Aug 31, 2021 Shaquille O'Neal Offers Shoe Deal To 6-Year-Old Rising Jujitsu Athlete And Donates $10K To Her Family Samantha Dorisca Aug 19, 2025 Duke University Has Officially Ended Its Full-Ride Scholarship For Black Students In Need Of Financial Assistance Shanique Yates Apr 12, 2024 Discover more of what matters to you finance Money athletes Black Excellence NIL AFROTECHU Events conference Multi-city event series empowers corporate executives, investors & tech moguls get your tickets discover more Sign up for our daily Newsletter Follow the latest updates and news right in your mailbox Send Business Add resume to the AFROTECH™ network At AFROTECH™, we help a network of 45,000 professionals communicate, collaborate, and unleash their creative minds.

What sets AfroLA apart Our voice Our content Our approach Mission Values Free news for all, forever Inform and educate Community first Impact reports Equity and inclusion statement Our story Our team Newsroom affiliations What is AfroLA? AfroLA is a nonpartisan , nonprofit digital news outlet. AfroLA is solutions-focused, data-driven and community-centered journalism for Los Angeles, told through the lens of the Black community , and with emphasis on how news may disparately impact L.A.’s most vulnerable groups and communities of color. AfroLA is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt public charity recognized by the IRS (Federal Tax ID: 88-2517496). Our legal name is AfroLA Media Group. (But, you can call us AfroLA 👋🏾.) What we do: Solutions journalism News you can use Accountability reporting Explanatory journalism Reporting for impact What we don’t do: Breaking news Op-eds (but we do occasionally publish commentary, which we label as such) Event stories Political endorsements What sets AfroLA apart Our voice Our approach to reporting is to tell stories through an undeniably Black lens, rather than with establishment media’s persistent white gaze. So, what does that mean? Our goal is to provide coverage of issues that matter to anyone who reads it with a distinctly Black voice. An AfroLA story will be understood at different levels depending on the experience and worldview you bring to it. Read closely and you’ll find everything from nods to Biggie lyrics to lesser-known lines from Langston Hughes. Even if you don’t pick up on these types of references, the nuts and bolts of our reporting will always be accessible. But, you’ll find certain aspects of stories more recognizable or relatable depending on the context you bring to it as an individual. Our voice is community-centered and amplifies the voices in our community that aren’t always heard and respected or are drowned out by the din of others. Some of our content is produced by community members themselves. Our content We believe coverage of the Black community that doesn’t go beyond fashion and beauty, food, entertainment, music or sports is extractive. It covers what Black people can offer the rest of society in terms of their skills, intellect and bodies. We believe that covering what matters to the Black community must encompass more than the cultural contributions of Black people. Our areas of coverage are determined and will evolve according to the needs and values of the communities we serve. We strive to amplify voices and highlight stories as a collaborative effort, not a transaction. Our approach Diversity, equity and inclusion are the foundation of AfroLA, as much as who is doing the storytelling and who those stories are for. The AfroLA newsroom is built upon more than the work of conventionally-trained journalists. We want to work with the community rather than talk about it or at it. To that end, a large portion of our digital content will be produced by contributors from the local communities being covered. These folks will include: Students from local youth programs, high schools and colleges—with an emphasis on the area’s many community colleges who are often left out of the classroom-to-newsroom recruitment pipeline. Community members with interesting perspectives and insights on the way things are, used to be or could be. Our role will be to coach and empower these community writers to refine their final product and build their platform. Mission AfroLA is solutions-focused, data-driven and community-centered journalism for Los Angeles, told through the lens of the Black community, and with emphasis on how news may disparately impact L.A.’s most vulnerable groups and communities of color. AfroLA’s mission is to find, celebrate and share intersectionality and universality in the Black experience. “Afro Angeleno,” or AfroLA, celebrates diversity in backgrounds and unity in culture and experiences within L.A. and beyond. “Afro” is also a nod to the change in identity language during the Civil Rights era and rise of the Black Power movement. We’re Black, proud and make no apologies for either. AfroLA leans into the fact that no form of Blackness is a monolith. We are who we are—no matter what shade our skin is or where we call home. AfroLA celebrates it all without pause. We are: Unapologetic. Black . Los Angeles. Values Free news for all, forever People can’t use our news if they can’t read it. We believe that in order to serve all people equitably, high-quality and relevant information about our communities must be free and accessible to all without the barriers of a paywall or paid subscription. We are committed to building an access-first news model where financial sustainability is not attained at the cost of accessibility. Our content is free, but it’s costly to produce. Read more about our business model and sources of revenue . Inform and educate Our content should always strive to inform and educate people within and outside of Black communities. We commit to creating content that provides context and nuance to existing narratives, challenges stereotypes and represents diverse experiences. Community first Our value is not determined by our financial statements, awards or page views. It’s measured by the value we provide to the communities we serve. We commit to act in the interest of our readers and the Black communities inside and around L.A. Advertisers, funders, politicians, celebrities and corporations will always take a backseat to serving our community. Impact reports We regularly publish Impact Reports to document our presence in our communities and the impact of our work. Read the 2023-24 Impact Report here . Equity and inclusion statement AfroLA seeks to protect the interests of our audience and people who are a part of our reporting, especially people from historically-marginalized communities and people in vulnerable circumstances. In our accountability reporting, we seek to expose wrongdoing and deficiencies in systems, and explore solutions to problems. We do this by valuing our community’s perspectives and how policies impact them more than perceptions of objectivity, and we refuse to lend a “both sides” journalistic stance to questions surrounding human rights and dignity. We affirm publicly that Black lives matter. We commit ourselves to anti-racism and diversity, equity and inclusion—in our coverage and within our newsroom. Our story AfroLA was born from resistance and persistence. Two journalists, a South L.A. transplant and one raised in the Inland Empire, swapped war stories over drinks: the media industry’s performative racial reckoning; hollow DEI efforts that continue to fail journalists and communities of color; why there are news beats and initiatives for most race/ethnicities except… you know. These problems aren’t unique to L.A. But, the pair’s outrage was largely because these problems could be found in a place so richly diverse as Los Angeles: A city of neighborhoods and nooks and crannies with people and heritages from around the globe couldn’t manage to imagine diversity past the largest, most visible groups . As a Black woman and a white man, these journalists’ outrage simmered at different degrees because of lived experiences. Regardless, their discontent with the status quo turned a cocktail-napkin plan into a sophisticated organization to disrupt the Los Angeles-area media community. Our team AfroLA strives to provide a public service as a quality local news provider you can trust. We appreciate hearing from you about how well we’re doing that. Feel free to get in touch with specific reporters or editors anytime with your observations or questions. You can also use our Contact page or email info@afrolanews.org. Read more about our staff, contributors and board of directors here . We are in the process of surveying all our staff and contributors for demographic information, in an effort to be transparent about who is responsible for the news and content presented on AfroLA and its platforms. (We’re a small shop, but it’s still a process that takes some time. Bear with us.) When the report is ready, we’ll post it on AfroLA.
