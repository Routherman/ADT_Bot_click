Kristen Stewart Shares NSFW Meaning Behind Her New Tattoo — And It's Not What You Think The “Twilight” actor marked her directorial debut with some daring new ink at France's Cannes Film Festival. By Curtis M. Wong Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost May 21, 2025, 02:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Kristen Stewart is celebrating the debut of her first-ever directorial feature with some fresh ink. The “Twilight” actor attended France’s Cannes Film Festival where her new film, “ The Chronology of Water ,” held its world premiere last week. She walked the red carpet in an all-white Chanel suit with trouser shorts in which her new tattoo, which reads “MINE” in all capital letters and is positioned on her right thigh, was visible. Kristen Stewart is making her directorial feature debut with \"The Chronology of Water,\" which premiered at France's Cannes Film Festival last week. Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images Advertisement Many fans were quick to assume that the tattoo was an homage to Taylor Swift ’s “ Guilty as Sin? ” The song, which appears on Swift’s 2024 album “ The Tortured Poets Department ” and is rumored to have been inspired by her brief romance with The 1975 musician Matty Healy , features the lyric: “What if he’s written ‘mine’ on my upper thigh, only in my mind?” But in an interview with New York Magazine’s Vulture blog , Stewart revealed that the new tattoo ― which members of the movie’s film crew also received ― is a wink at an especially titillating scene in “The Chronology of Water.” Stewart's new thigh tattoo, which reads \"MINE\" in capital letters, was visible beneath her trouser shorts. Lyvans Boolaky via Getty Images Advertisement “The coolest song in the movie is when she comes on her hand, smells it, wipes it on her fucking bicep, and goes, ‘I didn’t know a girl body could do that. Shoot come,’” she explained. “And then this song comes on and it goes, ‘Mine, mine, mine, mine.’ And it’s just fucking mine.” “The Chronology of Water” is an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s 2011 memoir of the same name. It follows Yuknavitch (played by British actor Imogen Poots ), who enrolls in a Texas college on a swimming scholarship. Her dreams of Olympic glory, however, are dashed when she begins dabbling in drug and alcohol use, though she later finds her true calling as a writer, a teacher and a mother. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Actor Imogen Poots, left, stars in \"The Chronology of Water.\" Stephane Cardinale - Corbis via Getty Images Advertisement Only time will tell if “The Chronology of Water,” which also stars Jim Belushi, Thora Birch and Michael Epp, succeeds in establishing Stewart as a filmmaker in her own right. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter last week , the Oscar nominee said the movie that is being screened at Cannes is just her “first draft,” and that she hoped to refine it before it hits the big screen in a wider release. “We barely finished this movie. It’s not even done,” she said. “I need to come home and literally have two more weeks in color and sound.” Related Kristen Stewart Pete Davidson Shares Why He’s Removing His Tattoos — As Well As The Staggering Cost Lily Gladstone Embraces Her Evolving Sexuality Amid New Film's Success This Comedian Wants To Help You Escape — And Maybe Even Forget About Trump For An Hour Kristen Stewart Marries Fiancée Dylan Meyer Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up Entertainment Don't miss a beat.

The Origliasso's are Australian twins who record as The Veronicas.
