BOOK YOUR TEE TIME VIEW RATES Golf Instruction Robert Whitt, PGA Kelly Plantation Head Golf Professional ​ I have been developing players of this incredible game for the past 19 years, after a successful junior and collegiate playing career. I coach players at all levels including beginners, intermediate, and advanced players of all ages. I am a class A member of the PGA of America. ​ As an alternative to teaching one method, I believe in the power of dialogue between coach and client. I pride myself on being well-versed in many methods and approaches to the golf swing, short game, and putting. It's about finding out what works for a particular person's situation, physical make up, abilities, and desired outcomes. Since everyone learns differently, it is my job to discover how to help someone learn new skills while unlearning undesirable skills that are detrimental to one's game. I use high-speed video analysis, occasional launch monitor technology, and ongoing dialogue beyond the golf lesson. ​ I have competed as a junior and collegiate player, as well as a professional. Collegiately, I played for Andrew College and the on to Florida State University where I discovered my love for understanding the golf swing and helping people improve. ​ My favorite aspect of player development is experiencing the moment when I have gone from being someone's instructor to being their coach. ​ Certifications: PGA Class A GolfTEC Certified Titleist Performance Institute Level 1 Titleist Brand Ambassador ​ For pricing, booking, and contact information, please visit my PGA profile page: ​​ ​ ​ Email Robert PGA Coach Profile KELLY PLANTATION GOLF CLUB 307 Kelly Plantation Drive Destin, Florida 32541 ​ TEE TIMES (850) 650-7600 RESTAURANT (850) 269-1120 © 2025 Kelly Plantation Golf Club.
