Sure its better then me home. Frank O'Reilly more testimonials » About Us Christopher Ryan, also known as “ Corny ” ran this establishment, going back to the 1940s through to 1981, where the pub was to lay dormant for sometime.  Ronan Fitzgerald then in 1986, reopened the doors, and blasted life back into the pub, after Ronan, there was Joe, Ollie, Padraic, and now the baton has been passed to myself, together with Paddy, Graham and Catherine we are building on the works of all the previous proprietors to make Corny's into a very special place, which it is, and not merely because it's here almost 265 years (That's older than Guinness). You'll find us in Tipperary Town, in the heart of Irish countryside, not far from the world famous Glen of Aherlow.  And we're here to serve you the very best in Irish music, both modern and traditional, live and recorded.  Along with a few pints of whatever you favourite tipple might be.  Craic is guaranteed, and the atmosphere is friendly and warm.  Don't worry about not knowing anybody, just pull up a stool, and soon a conversation will spark up on some matter, and watch the craic unfold. Myself, how did I end up running the oldest pub in Co. Tipperary? Well, the quick story is, it was a dream of mine.  At 18, I left Ireland and joined \r\nThe U.S. Marine Corps, honourably discharged in 1998, it was time for something different, so went back to school to study computers, worked in that field for nine years, and decided it was time for another change, along came Corny's. So here we are... So if you're passing, please pop in a say “How'ya”, relax and enjoy yourself, you'll be as welcome as can be. Remember Corny's for comfort. “ May the road rise to meet ya ” Mark Cooney Corny's Pub, Tipperary Town, Ireland. Tel: +353 (0)62 31886 | Fax: +353 (0)62 31886 | Email: info@cornyspub.com"

Circa 1667, altered. Stuccoed brick. Roof not visible. 4 storeys plus attic. 2 bays. Early C20 pub front to ground floor. Square headed architraved windows. Cornices above ground, first and third floor windows. Interior retains early turned baluster staircase from second floor upwards. Information for this venue is provided by the East London & City Branch of CAMRA Previous Names Local Authority City of London Last updated 10/12/2024 Last surveyed Leasehold owner Dominus Freehold owner individual Pub ID ELC/15007 Asset of Community Value Three star - A pub interior of outstanding national historic importance Listed status: II The star turn here is the right hand wall featuring two original glass advertising panels. Claimed as London’s first Irish pub, the Tipperary was taken over by Mooney’s of Dublin in 1895 who promptly demolished it and rebuilt the present establishment in the late 19th century under architect R L Cox. You can spot the Mooney’s lettering at the front doorstep with mosaic edging in the inner porch. Shamrock-embellished mosaic flooring runs down the right-hand side of the room in a nod to the pub's  Irish credentials. A fielded panelled bar counter with a linoleum inlaid top looks inter-war and is situated on the left but the line of the mosaic floor indicates the original bar stretched virtually to the inner doors, where the mosaic flooring is curved, and back to the rear door. The carved bar-back also appears to have run to the end of the room as there are remains of three bays there. Greene King had the pub in the 1960s and stated that they ‘refitted the interior to the style of Mooney’s days’ and added ‘all the panelling, fixtures and fittings have been retained’ and it is now difficult to determine what of the bar-back and counter are from the 1930s or are Greene King additions or adjustments from the 1960s. What is definitely a survival of Mooney’s late Victorian interior is the full height dark panelling running along the right hand wall featuring a pair of magnificent glass panels advertising stout and whisky. They are signed ‘H West, Houghton Street, Strand, WC’. The upstairs bar is known as the Boar’s Head Bar after the original name of the pub which only acquired its present name after 1918 to commemorate the Great War song. There are no original fittings but there may be some from the 1930s. Read full description General information about historic pub interiors Claimed as London’s first Irish pub, the Tipperary was taken over by Mooney’s of Dublin in 1895 who promptly demolished it and rebuilt the present small establishment in the late 19th century under architect R L Cox. You will spot the Mooney’s lettering at the front doorstep with mosaic edging in the inner porch. A pair of doors in the full height glazed screen leads into a single, narrow long bar on the ground floor stretching away from the street that was once lined with boozy newspaper reporters. A shamrock-embellished mosaic runs down the right-hand side floor in an attempt to establish the Irish credentials. A fielded panelled bar counter is situated on the left but the line of the mosaic floor indicates the original bar stretched virtually to the inner doors and was curved here and also ran to the rear door but nowadays there is a small snug area between the end of the counter and the rear door. The carved bar-back also appears to have run to the end of the room as there are remains of three bays in the snug area. Greene King publicity states that they ‘refitted the interior to the style of Mooney’s days’ and adds ‘all the panelling, fixtures and fittings have been retained’. It is likely, therefore, that the counter was shortened (and part moved upstairs as it matches it) or the present bar dates from the 1930s due to its style or even the 1960s? There are three stubs of partitions with coloured leaded panels in the top which could date from the 1930s or more likely be Greene King 1960s additions. Also, there may have been a small private bar on the ground floor possibly added in the 1930s and removed in the 1960s? What is definitely a survival of Mooney’s late Victorian interior is the dark panelling running all along the right hand wall featuring a number of small bevelled mirrors and a pair of magnificent glass panels advertising stout and whisky. They are signed ‘H West, Houghton Street, Strand, WC’. Given that it’s the Irish spirit that is promoted you may be surprised by the spelling. We think of Scottish whisky but Irish whiskey but there was no such convention until well into the 20th century – hence we get Jameson’s ‘whisky’ here. The upstairs bar is known as the Boar’s Head Bar after the original name of the pub – it only acquired its present title after 1918 to commemorate the Great War song. There is the original staircase at the rear and at the front the staircase from the front lobby looks like it was a later addition, possibly in the 1930s? The upstairs bar has a 1930s brick fireplace painted a deep red colour, the fielded panelling looks like it could date from the same period, and the counter could have been added here in either the 1930s or 1960s. The bar back looks modern.

Information for this venue is provided by the East London & City Branch of CAMRA Previous Names Local Authority City of London Last updated 10/12/2024 Last surveyed Leasehold owner Dominus Freehold owner individual Pub ID ELC/15007 Asset of Community Value Three star - A pub interior of outstanding national historic importance Listed status: II The star turn here is the right hand wall featuring two original glass advertising panels. Claimed as London’s first Irish pub, the Tipperary was taken over by Mooney’s of Dublin in 1895 who promptly demolished it and rebuilt the present establishment in the late 19th century under architect R L Cox. You can spot the Mooney’s lettering at the front doorstep with mosaic edging in the inner porch. Shamrock-embellished mosaic flooring runs down the right-hand side of the room in a nod to the pub's  Irish credentials. A fielded panelled bar counter with a linoleum inlaid top looks inter-war and is situated on the left but the line of the mosaic floor indicates the original bar stretched virtually to the inner doors, where the mosaic flooring is curved, and back to the rear door. The carved bar-back also appears to have run to the end of the room as there are remains of three bays there. Greene King had the pub in the 1960s and stated that they ‘refitted the interior to the style of Mooney’s days’ and added ‘all the panelling, fixtures and fittings have been retained’ and it is now difficult to determine what of the bar-back and counter are from the 1930s or are Greene King additions or adjustments from the 1960s. What is definitely a survival of Mooney’s late Victorian interior is the full height dark panelling running along the right hand wall featuring a pair of magnificent glass panels advertising stout and whisky. They are signed ‘H West, Houghton Street, Strand, WC’. The upstairs bar is known as the Boar’s Head Bar after the original name of the pub which only acquired its present name after 1918 to commemorate the Great War song. There are no original fittings but there may be some from the 1930s. Read full description General information about historic pub interiors Claimed as London’s first Irish pub, the Tipperary was taken over by Mooney’s of Dublin in 1895 who promptly demolished it and rebuilt the present small establishment in the late 19th century under architect R L Cox. You will spot the Mooney’s lettering at the front doorstep with mosaic edging in the inner porch. A pair of doors in the full height glazed screen leads into a single, narrow long bar on the ground floor stretching away from the street that was once lined with boozy newspaper reporters. A shamrock-embellished mosaic runs down the right-hand side floor in an attempt to establish the Irish credentials. A fielded panelled bar counter is situated on the left but the line of the mosaic floor indicates the original bar stretched virtually to the inner doors and was curved here and also ran to the rear door but nowadays there is a small snug area between the end of the counter and the rear door. The carved bar-back also appears to have run to the end of the room as there are remains of three bays in the snug area. Greene King publicity states that they ‘refitted the interior to the style of Mooney’s days’ and adds ‘all the panelling, fixtures and fittings have been retained’. It is likely, therefore, that the counter was shortened (and part moved upstairs as it matches it) or the present bar dates from the 1930s due to its style or even the 1960s? There are three stubs of partitions with coloured leaded panels in the top which could date from the 1930s or more likely be Greene King 1960s additions. Also, there may have been a small private bar on the ground floor possibly added in the 1930s and removed in the 1960s? What is definitely a survival of Mooney’s late Victorian interior is the dark panelling running all along the right hand wall featuring a number of small bevelled mirrors and a pair of magnificent glass panels advertising stout and whisky. They are signed ‘H West, Houghton Street, Strand, WC’. Given that it’s the Irish spirit that is promoted you may be surprised by the spelling. We think of Scottish whisky but Irish whiskey but there was no such convention until well into the 20th century – hence we get Jameson’s ‘whisky’ here. The upstairs bar is known as the Boar’s Head Bar after the original name of the pub – it only acquired its present title after 1918 to commemorate the Great War song. There is the original staircase at the rear and at the front the staircase from the front lobby looks like it was a later addition, possibly in the 1930s? The upstairs bar has a 1930s brick fireplace painted a deep red colour, the fielded panelling looks like it could date from the same period, and the counter could have been added here in either the 1930s or 1960s. The bar back looks modern.
