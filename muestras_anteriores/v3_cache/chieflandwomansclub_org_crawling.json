The Club has served as a social, educational and cultural center throughout its history. Historically, the Club was - and is - a place where women (and men) came together to forge relationships and create a sense of community through service activities. Our History In 1891, five years before Miami became a city, Flora McFarlane and the women of Coconut Grove formed the Housekeeper’s Club, a small group of women joined forces to become what we now recognize as the Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove. As a female homesteader and teacher, Flora McFarlane, was keenly aware of the isolation and loneliness of the pioneer woman. As a result, she invited women in the community to take part in weekly gatherings. Her goal was “to bring together the housekeepers of our little settlement by spending two hours a week in companionship and study.” By working together their pioneering spirit built a community. Their motto was “lend a hand.” Members of the Club have provided service to the community and support for each other for more than 150 years. Their first major project raised funds to build the Sunday School Chapel in 1894; which eventually became Plymouth Congregational Church. Plymouth Congregational Church The Club was known as the cultural center of early Coconut Grove, hosting theatrical performances, literary readings, musical entertainment and parties. Members were engaged in the Everglades conservation, saving Paradise Key consequently, forming a core group of key preservationists as the nucleus of Everglades National Park activists. In later years, the Club provided financial aid for local and national organizations like Casa Valentina, Cancer Survivors, Virrick Public Library, the Hacienda Girls’ Ranch, Canine Companions, and Heifer International. Additionally, the Club has sponsored the Learn-To-Swim program at the Virrick Pool that taught hundreds of West Grove children to swim. Its Young Artists’ Gallery scholarship program has (and continues to) provided exhibition opportunities and grants for Miami-Dade High School students with well over $4,500 in awards, grants, and scholarships. Over the years the Woman’s Club has proven to be a progressive and forward-thinking safe haven for women to come together, build relationships, and create a sense of community through their civic service activities. HISTORICAL TIMELINE OF ROYAL PALM PARK 1916-2016 In the 1880s and 1890s many Naturalists explored the Everglades. South Florida was the honeymoon destination for Kirk and Mary Munroe. The Housekeepers Club, founded in 1891, even hosted the 10th Annual Convention of the Florida Federation of Woman’s Clubs in their Coconut Grove clubhouse on January 25, 1905 at which Mary and Edith Gifford presented a resolution to conserve the Royal Palm Hammock as a State Reservation. In 1914, May Mann Jennings became president of the Federation and took further action to push through the conservation legislation. In 1915, an act of legislation granted the Florida Federation Royal Palm State Park. Without funding, the Florida Clubwomen raised sufficient dollars, dimes, nickels and pennies to make the hammock ready for the dedication in November of 1916. The Legislative Act stipulated that the Federation must improve, beautify, and maintain the state park. Often forgotten, this bit of history is a good reminder of the collective woman’s voice during a time when women had no voice, vote, or rights. 32 years later, the women of Florida remained steadfast in their resolve and maintained the state park despite brush fires, the 1916 Hurricane, WWI, the Great Depression and World War II. Simultaneously, the Federation actively pursued the formation of a National Park. Finally in 1947, The Federation deeded their adored Royal Palm State Park to the Everglades National Park. One hundred years ago, May Jennings dedicated the Park to the people of Florida and their children forever. As a result, historical boards were developed in conjunction with the Everglades National Park in honor of its 100th Birthday Celebration. Save the Birds The Story of Royal Palm State Park began with the protection of wildlife. A Dream Come True The first proposal for the preservation of Royal Palm Hammock was seeded at the Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove in 1905…view the boars. Save the Swamp! In 1840 the Florida State Legislature declared that the Everglades could be repurposed and turned into a profitable farmland to learn about the history of the effort to drain the Everglades.

September is Library Card Sign-Up Month, so today we're asking you about your favorite public library benefit. How do you use your library card? Your WHRC Librarian is on vacation with friends this week, but the beauty of a library card is she can borrow digital books even though she's out of town. Your public library might offer book clubs, craft workshops, yoga classes, children's story time, lectures, study rooms, printer and internet access, audiovisual materials, tax forms, sheet music, and more. They might provide access to newspapers, genealogy databases, language learning software, and other resources without needing a personal subscription. Some library systems offer free admission to local parks and museums. In DC, patrons can use the 3D printer, or reserve time in the recording studio. My hometown library supplied the community with Covid tests and masks throughout the toughest years of the pandemic. A friend from LA (who just signed up for her digital library card this morning) can borrow musical instruments when she gets back to California. And many library systems across the country are the repository for our member clubs' historical archives, making them accessible for researchers and preserving them for the future. So tell us, what's your favorite library card benefit? Is your club promoting Library Card Sign-up Month? Let us know in the comments! 📷A group of vacationing, book-themed-t-shirt-wearing women holding their library cards, with your WHRC Librarian on the right. #LibraryCardSignUpMonth … See More See Less 13 hours ago What club activity do you have planned for Alzheimer's Association Awareness month?

Next Monday, September 8th, is International Literacy Day. Literacy has been a key focus of GFWC, and our member clubs, since the 19th century: helping every member of our communities, old and young, reach their potential through reading skills and comprehension. During the 1962-1964 administration of GFWC President Margaret Long Arnold, we even sponsored the publication of a manual (with the help of experts at the US Office of Education, forerunner of the Department of Education). Specifically aimed at volunteers, we believed it would help our members dive into \"the fight against illiteracy.\" In a letter urging clubs to purchase the book, Arnold wrote, \"You will see that there is a job for all club members at all levels… This is an important project upon which we have embarked to help our fellow citizens help themselves. It is a giant step in the right direction and we must not let our footsteps falter as we face the many problems that will have to be surmounted.\" 📒\"Your club can spark the fight against illiteracy!\" Flyer for the new book \"Teaching Adults the Literacy Skills,\" 1963.

To round out our look at the letters received by the GFWC Resolutions Committee in the lead-up to the 1914 convention, here is one of the odder letters in that archival file: an urgent plea from inventor Laura A. McLain of Newark, Ohio, to Jane Addams (yes, that Jane Addams) regarding the dangers of unguarded hatpins. Mrs. McLain received a patent for her new and improved “hat-pin guard” in January 1914. Seeing a potential market, or knowing the legislative successes of the Federation (probably both), McLain hoped to persuade attendees of our June 1914 Convention to adopt her invention both in spirit (in the form of a resolution) and in fact (in the form of purchased guards). Her letter claims, “there is no work needed more than to stop the use of the barbarous unprotected hat pin…if there is any reform work needed more than this, I should be glad to know what it is.” Hatpins could indeed be dangerous, both purposefully – see the comments for links regarding the “hatpin peril” of the early 20th century, mostly in relation to women using them for self-defense against harassment – and accidentally. But, to be blunt (no hatpin pun intended), there were more pressing items on the GFWC agenda. Sadly for the enterprising Mrs. McLain, it doesn’t seem that the Convention took this problem seriously enough to offer it as a formal resolution. As for Jane Addams, my suspicion is that she never saw this letter; it was probably delivered to the Chicago hotel where the convention was taking place and redirected to the Resolutions committee. But the fact that a non-member addressed a plea to Addams, as a Chicago representative of GFWC, does speak to her renown as both an activist and a clubwoman. 📷 First page of McLain's letter to GFWC via Jane Addams, June 9, 1914. (Full text of the letter in the comments.) Resolutions collection, correspondence, 1914 📷 Patent no. 1,083,333 granted to Laura A. McLain of Newark, Ohio on January 6, 1914 for a Hat Pin Guard, \"a useful and ornamental device which may be slipped over the pointed end of a pin that is projected through the hat to prevent contact of said point with any object.\" … See More See Less 2 weeks ago GFWC proudly commemorates the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote.

Long before most military branches opened their doors, women were officially appointed as keepers in the U.S. Lighthouse Service, a proud predecessor to today’s Coast Guard. These trailblazing women safeguarded our shores, guided sailors home through every storm, and rescued numerous boaters in distress, undoubtedly laying the foundation for centuries of female Coast Guard heroes to come. Let’s celebrate the U.S. Coast Guard and honor the countless women who have served with strength and dedication by supporting the creation of a new national landmark: the National Coast Guard Museum!
