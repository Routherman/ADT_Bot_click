The name Florida’s Historic Coast says it all, it’s a place where visitors can discover some amazing history. A fantastic way to see Downtown Historic St. Augustine is to board the Red Train Tours or Old Town Trolley for narrated tours of the city and it’s historic sites. A trolley tour includes on and off privileges at family favorites stops including the Old Jail Museum and Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Museum . For those who would rather enjoy an informative stroll, the St. Augustine Free Walking Tour offers daily guided walks through historic streets. St. Augustine is home to the oldest masonry fort in the continental U.S., the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument , where the ramparts still ring with live musket drills and cannon firings. Discover sunken treasures of the past at the St. Augustine Shipwreck Museum and learn about real treasure hunters at the St. Augustine Pirate & Treasure Museum .

Splash and play at the kid-friendly splash pad at the St. Johns County Ocean Pier Park , throw in a line and fish for the big one from the pier, or grab a camera and capture the surfers jockeying for waves. Go wild at Anastasia State Park , a 1,600-acre haven offering kayaking, paddleboarding, and nature trails, and four miles of natural unobstructed white-sand beach. Saddle up with Equestrian Adventures of Florida where they will bring the horses for a guided horseback ride along the beach. Join an epic pirate adventure aboard The Black Raven , where kids and adults can live out their swashbuckling dreams on the high seas. Florida’s Historic Coast boasts acres of undisturbed marshlands teeming with wildlife. Take an airboat ride with Sea Serpent Tours and spot gators, birds, and more on thrilling eco-adventures through the St. Johns River and nearby waterways.

(October 14, 2024) — Many Floridians across the state have been profoundly impacted by Hurricane Milton and other recent storms. Florida’s Historic Coast feels and shares their pain as it has endured many similar challenges, recovering from Hurricanes Matthew, Irma, and others. The message for its neighbors is simple—we know what you are going through and we’re here for you. In light of the extreme damage suffered by much of Florida, the hospitality and tourism community has come together to welcome Florida residents affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. With plenty of rooms, locally owned restaurants and coffee shops for dining, and attractions and boutiques that offer a welcome distraction, the area can provide a safe and welcome haven while much of Florida begins the hard work of recovery and rebuilding. “Our area is extremely fortunate to have escaped with minor damage,” says Susan Phillips, President and CEO of St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra and The Beaches Visitors and Convention Bureau. “We understand that’s not the case across much of our state. Many of our fellow Floridians have lost their homes, the very place where you feel secure and comfortable. In order to help those who helped us in the past, we want to open our doors for our fellow neighbors so they can rest and recover from the shock of this historic storm.” “Something I’ve always admired is how supportive this community is,” continues Phillips. “We’ve been through damaging storms and know the value of a helping hand. It’s time to offer a hand in any way we can. For visitors, that means opening our community and being warm and welcoming hosts.” St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra and The Beaches Visitors and Convention Bureau have compiled special accommodations, dining, and activities discounts for displaced Florida residents on a dedicated webpage: www.FHC4U.com Located midway between Daytona Beach and Jacksonville , Florida's Historic Coast includes historic St. Augustine, the outstanding golf and seaside elegance of Ponte Vedra, the rural beauty of Hastings, Elkton, St. Johns, and 42 miles of pristine Atlantic beaches.

Today, this thriving community has come to be considered one of the most luxurious and prestigious recreational and residential destinations in Florida, if not the entire country. It was voted Money Magazineâs âBest Place to Live in Floridaâ and among the top 50 places to live in the United States. With above-average income, low crime rate, and top-performing schools.
