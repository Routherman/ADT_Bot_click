Born and raised in New Jersey, Kate studied Cinema Studies with a minor in French at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. During the summer, Kate can (occasionally) be found making your drink at the after-party. Or at the beach. Saidah Russell, Head of Programming Saidah (she/her) joined the Rooftop Films team in 2022 and previously worked full time in film exhibition at an arthouse theater in Westchester, NY. She has experience working on screening committees for several festivals, including the Sundance Film Festival, Hamptons International Film Festival, and Indie Memphis Film Festival. She is the Director of Programming for the TIDE Film Festival, an emerging Brooklyn-based festival dedicated to showcasing work by filmmakers of color. Kristen Kelley Rand, Head of Marketing and Communications Originally from just north of Boston, Kristen (she/her) is an actress and writer who earned her bachelor’s at New York University’s Gallatin School, where—pursuing as well-rounded an arts education possible—she designed her own interdisciplinary program marrying the studies of performance, production, and marcom. She came to Rooftop following tenure at Universal Pictures, W Magazine, and inside the halls of the McKittrick Hotel with Punchdrunk’s Sleep No More . She credits her maternal gram (and Julia Roberts) with helping shape her into the rom-com savant she is today, and firmly believes you should eliminate the term “guilty pleasure” from your vocabulary if you haven’t already. Langston Sanchez, Head of Technical Operations Langston (he/him) is a media technician and event producer who strives to combine a DIY ethos with seamless production to create high-quality, accessible events in his native New York City. After graduating from Hampshire College with a B.A. in Film and Video Art, Langston’s work has spanned both production and media education, with experience at institutions such as the Cooper Union, Apollo Theater, DOC NYC, Maysles Documentary Center, and the Sundance Film Festival. When not working alongside his team, Langston attempts to strike a balance between chronically online and blissfully unaware. Isabella Jackson, Programmer Isabella (she/her) is a writer and dancer from a tiny town in Pennsylvania. She came to New York to study Dance and Film at The New School, and went on to get her MFA in Screenwriting from Brooklyn College. She’s passionate about independent filmmaking, having worked in and around the industry since 2014 with IFP, The Hamptons International Film Festival, Montclair Film Festival, NewFest, and DOCNYC. Outside of festivals, she works in TV as a Writer’s Assistant and Script Coordinator. In the world, you can find her listening to disco, writing strange stories, or watching a campy horror flick. Hilina Kidane, Programmer Hilina (she/her) began with Rooftop Films as Volunteer Coordinator before joining the programming team. She’s worked across a number of film festivals and is currently full-time at the New York International Children’s Film Festival, where she supports youth-enrichment programs. Darby Puckett, Programmer Darby (she/her) is an actress and filmmaker from Virginia Beach, VA. She started at Rooftop as an intern, and that’s when the addiction to watching short films began. Aside from film watching, she’s usually training for a random half marathon, memorizing lines, or dream-casting Broadway musicals. Mariales Diaz, Programming Assistant Mariales Diaz (they/them) is a gender-expansive Dominican writer, director, producer, and programmer living in New York. Their storytelling explores experiences that exist at the intersection of survival and love. Diaz has worked on the production and post-archival teams at companies such as Pilgrim Media Group, Religion of Sports, HBO Max, and Proximity Media. They are a graduate of the SUNY Purchase Film Conservatory and a 2024 Sundance Institute Trans Possibilities Fellow. They also have participated in fellowships and artist programs such as Film at Lincoln Center’s Artist Academy, Sundance Ignite, Creative Culture at The Jacob Burns Film Center, and NeXt Doc. C. “Meaks” Meaker, Venue Manager Meaks (they/them) is a writer whose work often explores queerness, monstrosity, and the end of the world. Their plays have been performed and developed across the United States, including the Kennedy Center, Seattle Repertory Theatre, San Francisco Playhouse, Annex Theatre in Seattle, and About Face in Chicago. They are a Stranger Award Genius Nominee and Gregory Award Outstanding New Play Nominee. They are a former Jerome Fellow at the Playwrights’ Center, an alumna of Seattle Repertory Theatre’s Writers Group, and former Walter E. Dakin Fellow at Sewanee Writers’ Conference. Their essay “S(wallow)” won the Editor’s Prize at Porter House Review and they were a Creative Nonfiction Fellow at Lambda Literary. They received an MFA in Playwriting from University of Iowa’s Playwrights Workshop. When they’re not managing venues for Rooftop, they teach writing at City College of New York. Madeline Chandler, Volunteer and Local Partnerships Coordinator Madeline (she/her) does not stop talking about being from Pittsburgh, doing her undergrad at Penn State, and doing her post-grad degrees at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. If you ever want to talk about coffee, hippos or other round animals, ice breakers, or why teen movies are misunderstood, Madeline’s your girl! Tess Meersman, Festival Assistant Tess (she/her) is a filmmaker and artist who began working for Rooftop Films in 2024 after graduating from Emerson College with a degree in Film Production and double minor in Gender & Sexuality Studies and Literature. Her work has been featured in the GRRL HAUS Cinema screening series, Revolutions per Minute festival, Huret & Spector Gallery, Karen Aqua Gallery, and the Gravitational Lensing film series. When not at work, you can find her rewatching The X Files or making a collage with her beautiful cat, Hitch.

A food & beverage minimum is defined as the total food & beverage sales, prior to gratuity, service fee & tax. The minimums are based on date, time frame and the room size, not by the number of guests that are attending your event. If your total bill falls short of reaching the food & beverage minimum, the difference will be billed as a Room Rental fee. What is the deposit amount for private events?

All food and beverage prices are subject to a service charge of 20% (6% Banquet Service Charge and 14% Staff Gratuity). A 7% sales tax is applied on all food, beverage and the banquet service charge. All additional charges incurred during the event will be charged to the credit card on file unless otherwise specified. If your group is tax exempt you need to provide us your DR-14 form when sending in the contract. What are the menu selections for private events? Menus must be selected ten business days prior to your event. If menu selections are not received by this deadline, chef’s choice will apply. Guest counts dropping below 15 guests at least five days prior may be subject to chef’s choice of menu. Does Rooftop accommodate dietary restrictions for private events? We are happy to accommodate a wide range of special dietary needs and restrictions. Prior to signing off on your Banquet Event Order, please specify restrictions with your Event Manager.

Decorators must follow the decoration policies, Absolutely no tape on wall papered walls, no staples or nails on any interior materials. NO Glitter, Confetti or Wax Candles are allowed to be used. In the event that such materials are used which cause damage, a damage fee will be applied toward the final bill. We are not responsible for any items left after an event and do not guarantee the security of those items. What are the parking accommodations for private events? Valet services are available, either hosted by your group, or paid by any individuals who use the service. Self valet is $7 for 2 hours, and $3 for each additional hour. What is the final guaranteed guest count for private events? A guaranteed guest count is required no later than 3 business days prior to the date of the event. This number will be considered the guarantee not subject to change. If no guarantee is received, Rooftop will use the number of guests estimated on the original contract at time of the booking. There are no exceptions concerning this guarantee & the guarantee must be emailed to the Event Coordinator. What is the cancellation policy for private events? In the unlikely event you should cancel, all deposits are nonrefundable. In the event of a cancellation within seven days of the scheduled event, the client will be responsible for payment of 50% of the estimated food & beverage plus 7% sales tax & 20% gratuity.
