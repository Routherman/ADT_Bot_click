By Michael Hogue Staff Artist Mar. 24, 2023 | Updated Mar. 27, 2023 at 12:36 p.m. CDT | 3 min. read Michael Hogue This week marks the 50th anniversary of a classic local dive bar. The Dallasite has had three different locations in East Dallas, but there’s been one constant over those five decades: owner Rhonda Nail. After talking with Nail, you quickly understand why she’s a successful neighborhood bar owner and has become something of a legend in Dallas. Heaping praise on her customers and staff, she’s both humble and proud with a balance of grit, grace and style. Michael Hogue Nail, an Oak Cliff native, bought the Dallasite with her husband James Nail in 1973. It was then located on Gaston Avenue near Fitzhugh. At the time they married, she also owned the Office Lounge, in the spot that’s now The Goat. Eat Drink D-FW The latest food and drink reviews, recipes and info on the D-FW food scene. SIGN UP Or with: Google By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 16 ½ years of marriage, Nail lost her husband. “He died in the Office Lounge. He had a brain aneurysm and fell to the floor,” she tells me, pausing with emotion. After his death she couldn’t bear to keep the bar, so she sold it. “But I kept the Dallasite,” Nail said. Advertisement The Dallasite is one of the oldest continuously-operating bars in Dallas, and it’s the oldest bar in the history of the city that’s owned solely by a woman. Michael Hogue Related A living list: Dallas-Fort Worth’s oldest restaurants, aged 50 and up Advertisement In 1995, the city rezoned the Gaston location, prohibiting alcohol sales. So Nail moved the bar to Ross and Hall. The Dallasite resided in that location for 12 years until the landlord sold the building, forcing another move. Advertisement Nail then moved the bar to its current location on the corner of Bryan Street and Fitzhugh, catty-corner to the venerable Jimmy’s Food Store. The building used to house Hall’s Hobby shop. Michael Hogue If you walk into this 3,500-square-foot dive bar on a Friday or Saturday night, you’ll hear boisterous, sometimes drunken karaoke. The talent ranges from excellent to awful — but the crowd cheers the singers on either way. There’s no judgment here. “We clap for everyone,” Nail says, with a smile. “We call it Dallasite Idol.” Advertisement There’s plenty of seating around the rectangular central bar. People are dancing, playing darts, playing pool or hanging out with libations on the spacious patio. There’s a shuffleboard table that’s not quite level. The puck moves a lot faster throwing from the south to the north, but that adds to the challenge and the charm. And you won’t find a single patron who doesn’t have the utmost respect for the bar’s owner. Michael Hogue “I could tell you stories for hours,” Nail says. “But what I really want to talk about is my staff. Without them, I’m nothing.” Advertisement And the Dallasite staff feels the same way about her. Bartender Travis Bentley tells me why the bar is much more than your typical neighborhood watering hole. Michael Hogue During the Dallasite’s first 44 years, Nail tended bar. Six years ago, she decided to stop bartending and hired bar manager Calvin Bow to take the reins. “Calvin is great, and he deserves so much of the credit,” Nail says. Michael Hogue Advertisement When I ask Rhonda if being a woman bar owner comes with any unique challenges, she says, “Back in the day it did, but it’s better now. Back when my husband died, all these beer men told me, ‘Rhonda, you just need to sell this place.’ But that only made me more determined. “Those old beer men have come and gone, and I’m still standing.” Michael Hogue Related Delicious history: the stories behind Dallas-Fort Worth’s oldest restaurants Advertisement The Dallasite serves food and is located at 4822 Bryan St. It’s open from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week.

She loved to entertain people – when she sees smiles and everyone having a good time, that’s what makes it worthwhile to her. She took over a struggling karaoke bar in 2011 and named it Rockin Rhonda’s. She had built it from 8 people on a Friday night to standing room only. Her patrons named her “Rockin’ Rhonda” and she carried the bar to its initial success. They did as high as $32,000 in a month, and were doing karaoke 7 nights a week which was unheard of in the area. Then, in 2015, Rhonda’s life was turned upside down. Hurricane Matthew came in, and standing water rose up to the dance floor and in the bathrooms. The insurance company denied her claim, saying that the building was old and this was due to happen. Overwhelmed, Rhonda quit on her bar and didn’t train her staff. Bartender Sylvia followed someone around for a day, and even barback Jackson says that he taught himself. Rhonda drink whatever liquor she didn’t give away, and even her staff knows that when she’s working, they get bought drinks. Even worse, Rhonda cut corners that drove regulars away. Now, the bar is literally falling apart. The building is old, but Rhonda isn’t doing any basic repairs or maintenance. If there’s a couple bigger women on the dance floor and they’re bouncing around, it looks like it’s about to cave in. There’s holes in the ceiling, and Rhonda has 17 buckets around to catch the water from the ceiling. Bartender Jasmine says that structurally, the building is about to cave in. And so, Rhonda is about to cave emotionally. With over $100,000 in debt, if Rhonda doesn’t get her business back on track, she will be ruined. She even feels like she’s drowning. All of the patrons and staff love Rhonda, who has performed dozens of benefit concerts for the sick, ill, and wounded. However, Rhonda is facing the loss of everything, and she has reached out to Jon Taffer to help perform a bar rescue. Rockin Rhonda’s Lounge on Bar Rescue Jon with a heartbroken Rhonda In Sanford, Florida, Jon performs solo recon on Rockin’ Rhonda’s Lounge. The establishment is a classic neighborhood bar. Sanford has a median age of 35, and is located in an area with a median income of $34,000, which means it isn’t overly wealthy. However, Rockin Rhonda’s Lounge is located on South Orlando Drive, where 27,000 cars drive by every day. It clearly has the potential to be successful. Jon has had the bar under surveillance for weeks, and explains that Rhonda bought the bar more than 5 years ago and is in debt $100,000. Normally, he would be performing recon at night, but his team identified a serious structural issue with her floors. As a matter of fact, the beer coolers seem to be falling through the floor. Years ago, Jon had this same problem with the bar Murphy’s Law. It took weeks to fix the structural damage beneath the floor, and Jon is not sure if he has the time to do it. He has to first see if he can actually fix the bar. Jon arrives at Rockin’ Rhonda’s Lounge, and greets Rhonda politely (for a change.) The two greet, and Rhonda is ecstatic to see Jon Taffer in the flesh. Rhonda tells Jon that he can yell at her, but Jon explains that he could be at 1,000 bars, so he came here. Rhonda admits that she only has $45 in her personal account, and is down to the absolute wire. Jon instructs her to grab a pad and a pen, and together, the two of them will create a list of things they need to accomplish and move from there. Behind the bar, the beer cooler is clearly sinking through the floor. It was standing in water due to Hurricane Matthew. Rhonda admits that she wears back braces, so she is hurting herself by working. One of the bartenders points out that as Jon walks, the entire thing is on a slant – literally the entire floor is sinking. The patrons are actually looking uphill. The entire bar floor is in need of fixing, and he needs to also fix the bar. However, he has to fix the floor to fix the bar to fix the back bar. The coolers behind the bar don’t cool or close properly. There is an $80 residential refrigerator behind the bar. There are also no workstations for people to prepare drinks. Food is prepared in the back, and the only food available includes wings, eggrolls, chicken quesadillas, “Jamaican beef patties,” and corn dogs. Jon jokes that the beef patties bounce off the bar. In the back, all the food is prepared in a residential microwave oven. There is no cooking space. The freezer is also damaged, and requires velcro to be attached in order to close it. Rhonda admits that she wants so much more from her dream, but she has been struggling so much with the bar – she just doesn’t have the money. Jon sits down with Rhonda, and says that he needs to find out if she’s emotionally able to do this. Rhonda was a stockbroker and mortgage broker and made money early in life. She always had a talent for singing, so she started her own DJ and Karaoke business. She has missed many basics such as the cost of a drink. She pays around $4,100 a month in rent, so in order to make money, she has to make ten times that. Currently, she is making $19,000 a month. Business has been terrible. Jon asks that if he walked into her house right now, would it be clean? The bar is a mess, and so is her house. She’s burnt out and lives in a trashy house, and her dog is suffering from heartworm. Jon calmly explains that they are in a neglected room, and she is the one who neglected it. Rockin Rhonda’s Lounge After Bar Rescue – 2018 Update Jon is an absolute saint, although television might portray him otherwise. While he was initially worried about fixing the building and fixing Rhonda, he hoped to fix Rhonda by fixing the building. Rhonda is full of so much more confidence and pride, and bursts out into tears of happiness upon seeing the rescued bar. Jon went and repainted the building, installed a new sign, and made Rockin Rhonda’s into Rhonda’s – A Neighborhood Bar. The interior has been refurbished to feel more like a real lounge, and just looks incredibly cozy. Of course, the floor and safety issues have been fixed, and new systems have been reinstalled. Bartender Jack is beyond thrilled that he can walk through the bar without the slanting floor. The simple things in life are the best, and all the staff is excited about the new ice machine. Jon also installed an Orange Door Entertainment Center, which has 50,000 songs in it. He also had special wallpaper made, including graphics on the pool table lights. Rhonda’s – A Neighborhood Bar may be the best success story of Bar Rescue to date. Sales have doubled from their initial point, and Rhonda’s new bar is one of the highlights of Sanford, Florida. More than 300 Facebook reviews have come in for an astounding 4.3 star average review, and Google has 4.8 stars out of 5 over 77 different reviews. The only negative reviews are from regulars complaining about the slight price increases on beer, and the fact that smoking is no longer allowed inside. To this date, Rhonda’s – A Neighborhood Bar is performing well, and incredibly active on social media.

Credit: Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago LAKEVIEW — The Music Box Lounge and Garden is not officially a queer bar. Most nights, the space attached to the Music Box Theatre, 3733 N. Southport Ave., is a first-date spot and a hangout for cinephiles whose social lives revolve around the theater. But in recent years, manager Matt Kasin and bartender Sarah Hiatt have helped attract more queer staff and patrons to the space, not realizing they also were bringing Music Box Lounge back in touch with its roots as a lesbian bar with the same name. As sapphic-oriented spaces come back after years of decline , manager Kasin now has made it a mission to unearth and honor Music Box’s history as a thriving spot with women singers, drag shows, its own softball team and a charismatic wrestler-turned-owner and bartender named Rhonda Renee. RELATED: Chicago’s Lesbian Bars Vanished For Years, But Sapphic Spaces Are Making A Comeback Much of the story is still yet to be told, including what became of Renee herself, Kasin said. Hiatt has since moved on to a new role as chair of the Media Arts department at the Chicago Academy for the Arts, but comes by often to support Kasin. “It’s comforting” to know that 45 years ago, queer community was being fostered in the same space where he now works, Kasin said. “We got goosebumps when we read that Rhonda wanted it to feel like [her] living room. Because that’s what me and Sarah were saying — it’s like your living room … Any person can walk through and enjoy the lounge. I think it’s mostly about connection,” Kasin said.

Credit: Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago Lost History Music Box Lounge opened on Dec. 28, 1977 in a location that had previously been a candy shop, a liquor store and another bar called the Music Box Tap. The first ad for the bar, printed in the newspaper Gay Life (later Gay Chicago), proclaims, “Attention Ladies! A bar just for your lifestyle!” Within a few months, the Music Box Lounge pivoted from a lesbian bar to a “mixed” model that welcomed both gay men and lesbians. That’s typical of lesbian spaces, Hiatt said. “We feel like we have to be inclusive, and almost motherly. You open it up to everybody, right? So it’s like, ‘We’re a lesbian bar, but everybody’s welcome.’ You don’t see that as much with gay male bars,” Hiatt said. An ad for the Music Box Lounge in a 1978 issue of Gay Life.

Ads for the bar touted multiple programs and attractions. A sandwich shop opened in the spring of 1978, and a profile of the bar published in the lesbian feminist newspaper Blazing Star from April of that year touts a “rowdy” pool tournament every other Tuesday night. The Music Box also sponsored a softball team, which played at Athletic Field Park and called itself the Music Boxettes. Live entertainment catered to the bar’s diverse queer clientele. Michelle Faithe performed her song “Ode to Anita,” a satirical jab at anti-gay activist Anita Bryant: “Oh Anita! Don’t you pray for me, ‘cause I’m happy with my living in a gay society,” she sings in the chorus. For the first few months of its existence, the Music Box Lounge’s stage hosted mostly women singer-songwriters. In August 1978, it expanded to drag shows as well. A personal collection recently donated to the Gerber/Hart Archive and Library in Rogers Park includes a flier for “Guys Are Dolls,” a “female impersonation” revue at the Music Box Lounge. But the main attraction at the Music Box Lounge appears to have been Rhonda Renee herself, who had a blonde Farrah Fawcett flip and a feisty attitude.

The Music Box Lounge eventually fizzled out, but it’s not clear exactly when or why. Sarah Hiatt pours a beer at the Music Box Lounge and Garden in Lakeview on June 7, 2023.

By that time, the Music Box ran sporadically showed Arabic- and Spanish-language double features designed to appeal to immigrant families living in the pre-gentrification Southport corridor. The rest of the time, the theater was dark. “We have, as far as I know, no photos of the interior” from those years, Lyon said. Music Box Theatre reopened in 1983. Bob Chaney and Chris Carlo, a gay couple, ran it from 1983 to 2003, bringing in gay-themed films and clientele. Former Chicago Reader publisher Tracy Baim wrote about the films showed at the theatre for Gay Life. She confirmed the lounge appears in Gay Life’s bar listings in 1982 and 1983, but from there the trail goes cold. “I started at Gay Life in May of 1984, and by that, point I’m not sure that bar was still around,” Baim said.

Credit: Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago ‘We Were Pushing What We Like’ The current incarnation of the Music Box Lounge was created in 2014, when the arthouse theater bought the building next door, 3735 N. Southport Ave., and tore down an adjoining wall to make the two storefronts into one space. During the pandemic, Kasin and Hiatt were part of a skeleton crew running the outdoor screenings and events that kept the theater going during COVID-19 shutdowns. Often, the duo were the only employees in the building, cleaning out the bar and coming up with cocktail recipes based on movies. That’s when they would put on what Kasin calls a “very gay” playlist called “Club Boxxx,” which starts with Miley Cyrus’ “Bang My Box” and ends with Liza Minnelli singing “Cabaret.” “We were pushing our agenda in the sense that we were pushing what we like,” Kasin said. “But it felt organic, like it fit the space.” They also started playing their favorite queer movies while they worked, like “Basic Instinct” and “But I’m a Cheerleader.” And as crowds started coming back, Kasin and Hiatt, both of whom are gay, noticed a shift. “It was like, ‘There’s a lesbian, there’s a lesbian, there’s a lesbian at every table,'” Kasin said. “There’s been a lot of change over the few years that I’ve noticed,” Hiatt said. “The staff is more queer, and along with that comes more queer events. But like with a lot of places, it’s still underground.” The Music Box Lounge and Garden in Lakeview on June 7, 2023.

An entry in Rick Karlin and St. Sukie de la Croix’s book “Last Call Chicago: A History of 1,001 LGBTQ-Friendly Taverns, Haunts & Hangouts” confirmed the info. “I got the chills, because this is how we’d been [thinking about it] already. Just in our heads, you know?” Hiatt said. That led Kasin on an ongoing quest to learn more about Music Box’s history. “We felt like we were already unintentionally channeling, or reproducing, this [feeling] in a modern time,” Kasin said. “I was like, I have to uncover this. This is what I’m supposed to do. I’m in the right place at the right time.” Bringing The Past Back Into The Present On a research trip to Gerber/Hart, Kasin paged through boxes of newspapers, scouring nightlife columns and bar listings for any mention of the Music Box Lounge. “There she is,” he said proudly, holding up an original copy of the “Blazing Star” article. But there aren’t many threads to pull to find out more, particularly about Renee herself. Roland Hansen, a volunteer at Gerber/Hart, suggests Rhonda Renee may have been a stage name. It was common for members of the community to use pseudonyms in media interviews in the ‘70s, out of fear of retaliation from homophobic landlords or bosses, Hansen said. Without knowing Renee’s legal name, Kasin is left with a breadcrumb trail, a business and a community that survived mostly through newspaper ads. Like so much of LGBTQ+ history, the Music Box Lounge is a lost chapter in the story of a generation that was devastated by AIDS. Although few regulars remain to share their memories of the old Music Box Lounge, Kasin is dedicated to honoring its legacy. A staff photo featured in the Blazing Star article will soon be displayed on the wall of the new Music Box Lounge. Kasin and Hiatt have discussed making baseball jerseys printed with their vision of the Music Boxettes logo. If he does locate Renee, Kasin said he “would just want to close my eyes and let her paint the picture of what it was like being there day to day, since I’ve spent so much of my time there, standing behind the bar and just staring out the windows.” Asked what she would like to ask Renee, Hiatt said she would like to know “why they felt they wanted to make the space. “I also want to know if the softball team was any good,” she said.
