Therefore XR Highlands & Islands developed an in-principle discussion document called the Highland Renewable Energy Company Proposal to engage with people and organisations in the Highlands through a Community Assembly process to try and â¢Reduce energy prices for residents â¢Generate income to improve infrastructure, services and biodiversity â¢Lower CO2 emissions and address the climate emergency Evidence of Community Support The proposal received strong support from local people, which was demonstrated through ongoing community engagement led by local people. Consultation included: April to June 2023 – Highland Renewable Energy Company Proposal (now the Highland Peopleâs Power proposal) completed by members of Extinction Rebellion Highlands & Islands. 29th June 2023 –  Proposal submitted to all 74 Highland Councillors for their comments which received some favourable feedback. July 2023 – Petition seeking support put out via Change.org. Which received numerous support. See some of the with comments below: I think it is very important to achieve fairer energy prices for Highlands and Islands in Scotland I live surrounded by wind turbines and have solar panels but am tied into SSE no choice tariff. It looks to me like extortion. Especially since shareholders are raking it in at my expense. I believe that renewables are the right way forward and that we need to be truly independent of the polluting corporations that we currently rely on to create a better world locally and globally Excellent ideas for renewable energy! I hope change will happen soon to improve lives in the Highlands and Islands. To localise energy generation will reduce the losses from transmission as a start. Then there will be potential to export the benefits that we’ve got from living in the Highland Region. This could also be important for those in fuel poverty. The potentials are enormous for Highland region and our future sustainability. If we can produce our own publicly owned affordable, clean, renewable energy this would help resolve the Cost of Living crisis and would also have the added benefit in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and achieving Net Zero, as Highland Council have pledged to do by 2025. Aug-Sept 2023 – A major promotional campaign for a Community Assembly to discuss the proposal was undertaken through media, radio, posters and street outreach. 7th Oct 2023 – A Community Assembly was held to discuss the question of a publicly owned energy company in the Highlands (HPP). Some of the organisations that attended the Community Assembly included – Extinction Rebellion, Representative from the Welsh Government, Highland Councillor, Common Weal, Platform, Soirbheas, STUC and members of the public from as far as Orkney to Kincraig. 11th November 2023 – Community Assembly Follow Up meeting to discuss and agree the amendments made to the HPP proposal from the comments and suggestions made at the Community Assembly on the 7th October 2023. 18 January 24 -The proposal was presented to the CEO, Depute CEO and Climate Change Manager of Highland Council. They thought it was an interesting proposal but due to financial constraints  they said the Council would not be able to engage in the proposal at this time. 5 March 2024 – The proposal was presented to the Head of Strategy and Coordination, Directorate for Energy and Climate Change in the Scottish Government. Again they said it was an interesting proposal but the government had their own strategy and suggested we talk to Local Energy Scotland. 12 March 2024 -In a follow up meeting with Highland Council Climate Change Manager we received more details of renewable energy projects Highland Council were pursuing, none of which involved the community. 13 March 2024 – It was agreed at a meeting of the HPP Working Group that due to lack of enthusiasm from Highland Council or the Scottish Government to get involved in community energy projects that the group would set up its own Highland People’s Power (HPP) for the community and pursue their own community renewable energy projects. Who We Are MEMBERS OF THE HPP WORKING GROUP Gary Jack Gary lives and works with his wife on their croft in Wester Ross, growing produce organically and generating a large part of their energy needs through renewables. Having been involved in various roles in community projects in the Scottish Borders, now that he has settled in the Highlands has become involved in many local community projects as well as being the Treasurer and committee member of the local village hall. Gary was a Chartered Quantity Surveyor/Project Manager in the construction industry for over 35 years, initially in the private sector, then social housing provision. For the last 15 years, he project managed the installation of  renewables in domestic properties, as well as carrying out Energy Performance Certificates. Gary and his wife are both avid nature lovers which was one of the reasons for moving to the Highlands. Stephen Kelly After studying Mechanical Engineering in Glasgow, Stephen moved South and spent several years employed as part of a family team learning many aspects of running a successful business. Returning North, he was a founding member of a workerâs co-operative business based in Inverness and remained there over 20 years serving periods in the; sales, buying, marketing and finance functions. Outside of work, he has served in voluntary capacities as; trustee of a national childrenâs & young personâs charity, as an active elected member of co-operative boards and served as a community credit union director & treasurer. Before joining Energy4All as their most northern based project development team member he spent over a decade as a community and membership manager at The Co-operative Group, the largest consumer co-operative in the UK. Energy4All help grow and support a network of community energy co-ops with a mission to create more local, community-owned, renewable energy across the country. Simon MacLardie After years of environmental campaigning and volunteering Simon is supporting Highland Peopleâs Power and the creation of many kinds of new renewable energy projects to reduce the fossil fuel use that is driving the increasingly dangerous climate emergency. We are all stakeholders now and he is keen for Highland Peopleâs Power to work with local communities to find the best solutions. Communities receive very little benefit from projects owned by foreign renewable energy companies and Highlanders have also been paying more for electricity than in other parts of the UK. On learning this, it made perfect sense to support this community energy project which aims to bring more money into local communities instead of the benefits going to shareholders and overseas. Simon is a community nurse and has also worked as a medical herbalist, academic administrator and tree planter. Anne Thomas Anne Thomas was born in Bath and has lived near North Kessock since 2006. She is a Trustee of Transition Black Isle and Treasurer of Highland Cycle Campaign and also the Residents Association of North Kessock (RANK). She has been busy helping to deliver projects reducing our impact on the environment for food, travel and energy. She helped set up the North Kessock Community Market and chairs the Avoch to Munlochy Active Travel Link working group. She grows lots of vegetables and fruit and keeps bees and chickens. She and her husband have spent many years making their home as energy efficient as possible with solar thermal and PV, a small wind turbine and ground source heat pump together with large amounts of insulation. This means that they are largely self sufficient for energy and a hybrid car used infrequently with much more use of bike and public transport means energy use for transport is low too. Anne recently retired as a Speech Therapist working with children with additional needs but is hoping to undertake some supply work. She is Vice Convenor for Highlands and Islands Branch of the Scottish Greens and has been a Candidate at all levels. Anne is a member of Hilton Parish Church and led their project in 2011/12 to install 3 solar systems and energy saving measures, cutting their energy use by about 2/3. She also lead the Friends of the Earth Project in 2009 called ‘Keep the Heat in Campaign’ helping small businesses to save energy by trading with their doors shut, switching to LED lighting and other energy saving measures which successfully saved large amounts of money and carbon emissions. Kate MacLachlan Kate is from the north of Ireland and has lived in Scotland for the last forty years, for most of that time in Glenurquhart. Kate worked in Inverness as a social worker and mental health officer. She has also written short stories, articles and a novel. Kate is married with three children and four grandchildren. She is a keen cyclist and swimmer, and is interested in all things environmental. Bertie Maclean Weâre pleased to introduce our newest team member, Bertie Maclean , who joins Highland Peopleâs Power as our Community Energy Officer . Bertie was born in Tongue and now lives in Lairg.

From 6 months to 96 years old, visitors find activity and information that puts the past in perspective and moves the present into the future. During your visit you’ll step into a nineteenth century classroom and become a student of the 1870’s. Enter a medical world when late night house calls were made on horseback and payment was in chickens. Immerse yourself in the culture of Eastern Kentucky music and visit the Cyrus and Judd families. Create your own music on our Karaoke Korner stage or at Music Quilt, an interactive sound sculpture. Salute those who served during the wars of the twentieth century and see Hitler’s last telephone. The Discovery Center boasts many areas of interactive exploration, including a special play place for toddlers and a flight simulation station for pilots of all ages. Walk into the Ohio River town of Poage’s Landing and navigate Little Joe, an actual towboat. Role play in the streetscape of a river community. Learn about the natural world around you in the tree house exhibit or rest awhile on the front porch and enjoy games, a puzzle garden and a puppet dog house. Our Mission “The Highlands Museum & Discovery Center provides avenues of discovery to children and visitors of all ages. Interactive exhibits, educational experiences and innovative programs, both cultural and historical, celebrate our past, explore our present and enrich our future.” The museum achieves its mission with three goals: Education for all ages about the past, the present and the future Heritage and artifact collection and interpretation Cultural tourism destination for US Byway and US 23 Country Music Highway A Brief History The Kentucky Highlands Museum was organized in 1984 as a historical and cultural center for the Ashland, Kentucky area. The Museum was housed in the historical Mayo Mansion until taking up residency in downtown Ashland’s Main Street District in the first floor, basement, and mezzanine levels of the former C. H. Parsons Department Store in 1994. In 1997, the museum, following a strategic planning process, changed its name to the Highlands Museum & Discovery Center with the above mission statement. In 2003-2004, the museum began a capital campaign to raise funds to both renovate the museum spaces of the Parsons Department Store in downtown Ashland and clarify the region’s history with interpretive exhibits. The campaign also provided for a permanent endowment to support future operating On November 15, 2013, the Museum purchased the Parsons building from its landlord.  The purchase, termed “A New Beginning,” represents a milestone in the Museum’s history because it opens opportunities for additional improvements and expansion into other floors of the building. Our partnership with Morehead State University in 2014 allowed us to create a Space Science Center displaying satellites, CubeSats and showcase the Space Program at MSU. The museum completed an extensive renovation of the lower level bathrooms, doors and the elevator in 2017 with the assistance of CDBG grant matched by the Woodlands Foundation that ensures the museum is ADA compliant. The newly renovated 4 th floor, the Highlands Center, is the largest conference center in the city of Ashland. It is available for large conferences, reunions, and receptions accommodating up to 500 people. Plans are underway to make an all-new Discovery Center become a reality for the children of Ashland and the surrounding area. CONTACT US!
