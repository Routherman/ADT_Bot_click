Print Reporting from HURRICANE, Utah — Here’s the story with the big copper penis, and every word of it is true. Steve Ward was traveling from southern Utah to Las Vegas, as he often does — a little business, a little pleasure. Gleaming from the highway stood a giant copper statue of a bull. ------------ FOR THE RECORD: A previous version of this article referred to Zion National Park as Mt. Zion National Park. ------------ Ward has a thing for misfits. Here in Hurricane, pronounced, improbably, “hur-kun,” he is arguably the most prominent one. Barista’s, his bar and restaurant, hosts a carnival of oddities: wrought-iron signs affixed with pinup girls; a wall covered in drunken marker scrawl; a tiny two-seat table dressed in an ancient tablecloth and half-melted candles, perched 6 feet off the ground on a riser where Ward sometimes holds court. Advertisement Barista’s is also, in a county 70% Mormon, the only place you’ll find an ad showcasing under-clad women grinning from the side of the building in the approximate direction of the local high school, which is across the street. Ward went home and told his wife, Pam, about what he saw in Vegas. The bull came back to him, crept into his thoughts when he imagined the next addition to his restaurant’s strange collection. One day he left again, 100 miles southwest. And $130,000 later, he returned with the bull, which has no name. After several decades of marriage to a man like Ward, his wife is hard to shock. Advertisement “No,” she said, “I wasn’t surprised.” Ward had a crane place it atop the sign of his restaurant. The town of Hurricane was aghast. “Because of the penis,” Pam Ward said. It was hard to miss. Against the unspoiled southern Utah vista of bright blue sky and striking red sandstone cliffs, the conical copper appendage resembled nothing so much as a varsity cheerleader’s megaphone. “Party-hat-shaped,” declared the Independent newspaper in southern Utah. Its resemblances, and merit, are in the eye of the beholder. And many who beheld it thought they had better call the mayor. Advertisement “We don’t like the reputation he gives to the city,” said City Manager Clark Fawcett. “The male organ on the bull was considerably bigger than his plan had showed. It wasn’t appropriate for this type of community.” So began a long, ugly fight on message boards, the editorial pages and sometimes the sidewalk, where a shirtless man in a beat-up Mercedes was captured on an employee’s camera phone cursing the restaurant before punching the employee and smashing the phone. What began as a complaint about decoration exposed a far wider simmering resentment against Ward and everything he touched. Commentators to online stories and petitioners against his business license railed against the restaurant, its food, its cost, its staff, Ward’s family, his presence in town and just about everything about him. “This establishment takes advantage of unsuspecting people who are unaware of the price gouging and should be stopped,” said Ross Ransom of Ivins, Utah, on a petition seeking to revoke Barista’s business license. “The owner is rude, condescending, arrogant, and way too full of himself. Not a good representation of the people of southern Utah.” Pam Ward married a brawler. His attorney, before the City Council, called him a “passionate, even extreme individual.” Advertisement So it should have surprised no one when Steve Ward came out swinging, calling his opponents “burrito-eating punks” and flexing his 52-year-old biceps while interviewed in the local newspaper’s online television studio. Such conduct didn’t help him before the City Council, which denied Barista’s a hard-liquor license in March. Fierce resistance gave way to quiet surrender. In late March, a welder went up on the roof. He worked on the bull and came down with what looked like a party hat. Ward set it on the bar. For a while, that was that. Southern Utah towns like Hurricane (population about 14,000) find themselves in a job and population boom that’s demanding more of formerly sleepy burghs — more hotels, more lodging, calls for a better city website. St. George, the closest city to Hurricane, ranked fifth on the list of fastest-growing areas in a March report by the U.S. Census Bureau. Those new hires are creeping farther out to towns like Hurricane, long a way station for hikers headed for Zion National Park, which itself is becoming a bigger draw for wealthy adventure-sport tourists. New people bring change. They keep restaurants like Barista’s open. And some longtime residents here are worried. “The area is changing, and the [city] council is having to come to grips with that at some point,” said Fawcett, himself a member of the Mormon Church who nevertheless takes his wife to the Olive Garden in St. George, where they see people drink. Advertisement But as things turned out, the bull fracas did not end quietly after all. After a month of relative silence, the mayor went on television to celebrate Ward’s capitulation. Ward noticed. And back up went the welder. And back on went the party hat. With the battle lines firmly drawn, Pam Ward is confident she and her husband will prevail, though the bar was again denied a hard-liquor license in May — no one else in town has a license except the private Eagles Club. In the meantime, Barista’s can serve only beer and wine. The Wards chose this town because Steve Ward’s parents once ran a hotel here. Pam and Steve Ward, who have operated Barista’s for 10 years, raised their children here. They contribute to the local economy and serve a role no one else in town will play, she said. They abide by Utah’s alcohol rules, including the use of what Utahns call a “Zion curtain,” a barrier to block patrons’ view of the mixing of alcohol or opening of beer bottles. (The Wards use a walk-in freezer to stay out of sight.) They have as much claim to the town of Hurricane, she said, as those who want them gone. “We will be here” — and here she banged the table — “until” — bang! — “the day” — bang! — “we die.” nigel.duara@latimes.com Twitter: @nigelduara More to Read What it’s like to eat at all the ‘Vanderpump Rules’ restaurants post-#Scandoval June 12, 2023 How a solar eclipse threw a remote Utah town — and its Navajo workforce — into crisis Oct. 19, 2023 Voices Will the tug-of-war over Utah’s canyon country ever end?

      "text": "Copper 29 - Bar Bites & More — 2 STIR WITH LOVE Blog Recipes Entertaining Reviews- Life Musings Shop About Menu Blog Recipes Entertaining Reviews- Life Musings Shop About Copper 29 - Bar Bites & More January  5, 2017 As is our tradition for our anniversary, we head to Miami at the end of October each year to celebrate. This past October was no different. In years past, we have hosted little gatherings at our apartment there, but with so many dear friends to visit, it’s sometimes easier to gather at a bar or restaurant to catch up.  With the proliferation of so many cool, happening hangouts cropping up all over Miami the question was where do we go. For this night out we wanted to keep it centrally located for all parties by staying in Coral Gables.  The Gables is an old historic area of Miami known for its Mediterranean Revival style architecture with streets lined by the famous banyan trees. It's home to such landmarks as the Venetian Pool and the Biltmore Hotel, along with the popular and most noted street; Miracle Mile. And that was exactly where we were headed to try out Copper 29 Bar recommended my our friend, Stephanie.  This Coral Gables bar is reviving the idea of the perfect cocktail. Using the art of mixology paired with bar bites to create a relaxed atmosphere of food and drink, which was what we were looking for. Stephanie ready to eat, drink and be merry. Especially, given that we hadn’t seen each other in awhile, and our goal was to chat and catch up with each other’s lives. However, that was not quite what we got. Well, at least not on a Friday night.  Don't get me wrong, it's not because the place wasn't cool.  It was cool with an interesting mix of decor including an entire wall of plant life. But when we opened the door, the music was pumping and the place was jamming and we thought we might not hear each other breathe. Silly of us to think that a relatively new hangout on a Friday night would be a quiet place to chill. We were told that the owner recently decided to make Friday nights a Happy Hour with DJ music pumping.  That said, the music mix was a fantastic groove, prefect for dancing and keeping it interesting for a proper happy hour.  If we hadn’t wanted to talk this would have been an ideal spot. And on any other night there, we could have done that.  However, Friday’s are made for letting go after a long week of work.  So we stuck it out because the vibe was happening, the atmosphere interesting and the menu looked promising. (Spoiler Alert:  We were all glad we did!) Some of us started off with Moscow Mules served in cool copper mugs which keep the drinks nice and chilled. If you enjoy a spicy drink, this one delivers. The ginger beer brings that bite while the mint is refreshing and surprisingly light. The rest of our group ordered Martinis and Old Fashioned and they were like a good ole fashion should be…good. From there, we began ordering a dish at a time, each as good as the last. Martini, dry, shaken with olives Good Old Fashioned... good Jalapeño Corn & Cheese Biscuits These are decadent balls for yum.  Crispy exterior, doughy middle with whole pieces of corn throughout served with a Bourbon Honey Syrup that has even your biscuit begging you to dip for more.  I loved watching everyone's expression as they popped these in their mouths. Eyes wide and then the expressive smile that gleamed; 'what did I just eat and is there enough for everyone else?' .   Only wish there was a bit more jalapeño in these biscuits.  The Bourbon Honey Syrup provided enough sweet that they could have used a bit more heat…  at least for my, and everyone at the table’s taste.  Even with that slight spice suggestion, we would order this again in a heartbeat. Glistening with honey wonder. Tuna Tartare Classical and good balance.  Slight hint of heat that was a nice play off the creaminess of the avocado.  Served with chips for scooping and enjoying each bite.  Well done. Kale Salad We’ve all eaten tons of kale salad.  The key is the cut of the kale. The chop on this one rendered the kale tender, and manageable to eat.  The Caesar dressing was creamy but not overbearing and softened the salad just the right amount.  The Parmesan cheese in nice big shards added the salty sharpness we all want. Then there was the addition of radicchio and sunflower seeds that were subtle while still imparting an effective crunch and earthiness. And last but seriously not least; the croutons, which were more like lightly grilled garlic toasts.  Much better than the average crouton who would be ashamed to show up in a salad against this king of crouton. Would you guess that everyone thoroughly enjoyed this salad?  Good guess. Mac n Cheese Creamy with lovely Fontina and a deep truffle flavor that perfumed the entire dish.  Sprinkled with bread crumbs and pancetta, this is a dish worth the calories on a Friday night.  And with the music playing,  there is no need for guilt since you can get up and dance some of those calories away. Looking dark and sultry, this mac n cheese was just that. Short Rib Sliders Oh the juxtaposition of these pretty, almost dainty little sandwiches that deliver a fun rollercoaster ride of flavor.  The short ribs were tender and juicy, layered on top of the surprising and interesting addition of polenta.   Caramelized onions sweetened the pot while the alioli had a horseradish note that provided the right kick. Needless to say, these were devoured by our group. Key Lime Pie in a Jar Tart and Tangy and Luscious.  Topped with grapefruit that was a surprising, refreshing touch, this dessert was right on point.  Team vote:  Approved. Team goal:  Polish this off.  Goal: Accomplished. Oreo Cookie pie in a jar This dessert was decidedly too sweet for my palette and everyone in our group but for those with a true sweet tooth it might just hit the mark. Music getting our table moving in our seats. A very cool vibe, as if you were hanging out in your own cozy, stylish lounge. Overall, the joint was jamming.  A great spot for a Friday night Happy Hour if you want to move to the groove of hip swaying music, enjoy good drinks and upscale bar eats.  If you want to chat and have a quieter evening, I would highly recommend coming on a weeknight to work your way through the menu and have the mixologist blend you up some cocktails. The food, good service and overall vibe are definitely worth the trip.  So with winter still brewing here in the Northeast, this might just be the right time to head south for more reasons than just the sun.
