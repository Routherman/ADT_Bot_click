Hideaway Pizza was founded in 1957 by Richard \"The Big Kahuna\" Dermer and his wife, Marti, with the first location in Stillwater—famously near Oklahoma State University. Little Annie Fanny, a '60s era cartoon, was on one of the collage walls in the original building on West Third Street. One particular strip had Annie saying, \"Leapin' lizards, it's the Big Kahuna! From that cartoon, employees started calling Dermer the Big Kahuna. close"
