Reply Fleur Houtman March 19, 2024 at 5:50 am Dear I listening to your Spanish podcast . I would like to listen and read at the same moment . It work better for me to hear and see how it’s been written. Which program to use need to buy for this ? Reply Sarah Carvalho January 20, 2025 at 2:39 pm Hello Fleur! It is Sarah from the Coffee Break team here. When you purchase the premium version of our Coffee Break Spanish podcasts, you get access to the transcription of all the lessons for that level. You can check out which level works best for you here ! Reply Natasha February 18, 2025 at 3:05 pm Hello I have listened to you Italian class on gender of words and it said at the end of the class about words ending with ale or ile Could you explain more and give me more words that end with these letters and explain more about the gender of these words please? Thank you Reply Coffee Break Languages February 19, 2025 at 9:56 am Ciao Natasha, thanks for your question. In Italian, nouns ending in -ale or -ile are generally considered masculine, but there are some exceptions. In fact, while most nouns ending in -ale or -ile are masculine (esempio: il giornale, il tribunale, il fucile, il campanile, eccetera), there are a few that are feminine. For example, la spirale (the spiral) is one of these exceptions. We hope this helps!

I went to the building and the receptionist told me that there was no Coffee Break office in the building.  Was she wrong?

David Abrahamovitch, Founder & CEO. David is the founder & CEO of Grind. In 2011, alongside his friend Kaz James, he turned his father’s old mobile phone store in Shoreditch into a coffee shop called Shoreditch Grind. As it evolved, Shoreditch Grind became a “café by day and cocktail bar by night” and the first location became an East London institution. Over the last decade, Grind has grown to become the breakout coffee challenger brand in the UK, with fourteen locations across London, a thriving online business serving hundreds of thousands of customers around the world, and Grind coffee beans, coffee cans and coffee pods are available in most major UK grocers. Grind is also the global coffee supplier to Soho House, and is partnered with other best-in-class brands like Oatly and Brewdog. David’s vision is to grow Grind into the world's leading challenger coffee brand, encouraging people around the world to enjoy speciality coffee, sustainably. @davidabrahamovitch David is the founder & CEO of Grind.

We created the UK’s first home-compostable coffee pod. This was (and still is) a big deal. Unlike so many aluminium and plastic pods that dominate the market, ours are made from plants.

Like all the best things in life, we began in Shoreditch. That was back in 2011 when our founder, David, turned his father’s mobile phone store into the first Grind café—but think “coffee shop by day, cocktail bar by night” (primarily a homage to the holy grail of cocktails: the Espresso Martini). Now, we’re all over London with 14 sites and our very own roastery, and we put a decade’s worth of coffee knowledge into home-compostable pods.
