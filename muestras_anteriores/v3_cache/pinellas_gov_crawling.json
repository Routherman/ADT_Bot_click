Project Management Project Management Team Our dedicated Project Management team is a diverse group with a broad range of technical knowledge and skills that work to facilitate development within the county. From simple to complex projects – our team is here to help you through the entire process for your development project. Contact the Project Management Team to discuss your project and learn about requirements and receive guidance from staff to help your application through the early stages of your project. Project Manager Role The project manager acts as the single point of contact, opening the lines of communication by bringing an appropriate county team together, and greatly reducing the amount of time applicants spend going between staff members. Typical Project Management Projects New Multifamily Housing Projects – Simple and Complex New Commercial Construction Commercial Changes in Use / Expansions of Use Subdivisions – New and Revisions to Existing Institutional Projects – Private and Public Affordable Housing Developments What is Your Project? We understand that residents and businesses envision a project that they desire to build within the County. In most cases their project will require multiple permits or approvals depending on the complexity of the proposal. We want to understand the customer’s “immediate project objective” and then ensure that communications, processes, approvals, and actions are coordinated efficiently for the entirety of the project. On this page Typical Projects What is Your Project? Core Services Offered Our Service Commitment Frequently Asked Questions Additional Links and Resources Contact Us View public maps Find your Zoning and more: Pinellas County Public GIS Parcel Viewer, Historic Aerials, Flood Maps and other resources. Core Services Offered Development Review Meetings These meetings are offered to identify required applications, establish project timelines, and determine if there are any major issues prior to application submittal. Early Assistance is free and focuses on sites that are in a more conceptual state or that are not a part of the DRC process. Site Plan Pre-Application meetings are a paid pre-submittal review with staff comments and a public meeting process. Request a Meeting Site Development Permitting The Project Management Team facilitates the distribution and tracking of Site Plan reviews for site development. From a new commercial drive through addition to elaborate subdivisions, a Site Plan handled by Project Management gets the same quality treatment. Our team will then monitor and offer guidance through the Site Plan review process, and other related permits for the scope, to see the project completed start to finish. Submit an Application Complex Building Permit Application Assistance For those projects with minor site development but have complex zoning and uses tied to the building permit scope. Petitions to Vacate Petitions to Vacate are coordinated by the Petition to Vacate Team, which includes members of Project Management. Learn more . Our Service Commitment We are committed to a partnership, between a customer and staff, working together to process development proposals in a more timely and predictable way. Some key ideas and practices are established to support the partnership culture: Both the County and the customer will appoint a single point-of-contact for project communications and coordination. The County will assign multi-disciplinary team (MDT) members as required by the project complexity and scope. MDT members remain constant throughout the entire project to improve review consistency, where feasible. Staff and customer representatives use proactive and supportive communications with each other. The County and customer points-of-contacts communicate regularly on the project progress. The process will be structured to create time for appropriate team members and customer representatives to meet, confer on issues and solve issues. Staff and customer are open to be creative in ways to resolve issues within the regulatory framework. Collaboration, open-mindedness, flexibility, and communication are all essential in this process. If the team is unable to solve the problem for any reason, the project manager and appropriate staff members will elevate the issue . We guarantee a second opinion. We will work with the customer to determine the most appropriate path to together to a final decision and then get you there. Frequently Asked Questions When Do I Need Project Management?

(Donations Accepted) Enjoy a virtual tour presented by the University of South Florida’s Access 3D Lab. Step back in time with a tour of Fort De Soto Park’s Quartermaster Museum and Battery Laidley. The museum is on Mullet Key, the largest of the five islands at the mouth of Tampa Bay on the Gulf of Mexico that comprise Fort De Soto’s 1,136 acres. You’ll also see Battery Laidley, which was the fort’s primary defense, and the site where Battery Bigelow stood. Battery Bigelow, the fort’s secondary defense, was destroyed in the hurricane of 1921. Both batteries were named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. You can stroll through Battery Laidley, home to the last four surviving carriage-mounted 12-inch seacoast mortars in the continental United States. The military first became interested in Mullet Key and the other barrier islands shortly before the Civil War. In 1898, the Army began construction on the first Mullet Key military post. Construction of the Fort De Soto gun batteries and various post buildings continued through 1907. Between early 1900 and about 1906, a total of 29 buildings were erected. Those included a 100-foot-long barrack, hospital, stable, guard house, a shop for blacksmiths and carpenters, an administration office, a mess hall and kitchen, a bake house and a storehouse. The Quartermaster Storehouse building was originally built as a Post Exchange. The army post remained active until 1910 then soldiers left a caretaking detachment in charge. During the 1920s and 1930s, hurricanes hit the area, damaging the buildings. The post buildings were sold for salvage and torn down in 1939. Modern visitors saw only Battery Laidley and thought the battery comprised the entire post, not realizing that there were 29 wooden buildings and structures as part of the former military post. In the 1990s, the County provided historical interpretation with the creation of the display room, room descriptions and a history booklet. Then, in the mid-1990s, park staff, volunteers, and visitors proposed the reconstruction of one or more of these buildings. The concept became a reality in 1999 when the Friends of Fort De Soto Inc. , a citizen support group, received a matching grant from the state Historical Museums Grants-in-Aid Program for museum exhibits. Using historical photographs, Army engineering condition reports and government documents, an architect duplicated the original Quartermaster Storehouse building. Park staff built the 833-square-foot wooden structure. The head carpenter acted as the site contractor and the park’s mason laid the brick footers. Many employees worked to install the cedar shakes on the roof while others painted the exterior of the building. Today’s Quartermaster Storehouse building has features not found in the original building: air conditioning; fiber-optic lighting; concealed insulation in the walls, door, and ceiling; as well as a fire-suppression system. Inside the museum, visitors see the post’s quartermaster surrounded by supplies he would have issued to the soldiers. Wall panels depict the earliest history from the 16th Century when Spanish conquistadors encountered the Tocobaga Indians in the Tampa Bay area. Several panels show the Spanish-American War and its impact on the Tampa Bay area. A touch-screen computer program provides information, images, narration and historical film clips. Visitors can learn about the earliest area history to current information about the Friends of Fort De Soto, nature trails and other park features. Three display cases contain Spanish-American War items, recovered artifacts from the park and World War II military history, including an original practice bomb from the Mullet Key Bombing Range that was found in the park. A porch scene provides a glimpse of daily life with a woman’s dress, a deck of playing cards, a rattlesnake skin and other items from the early 1900s. The largest wall panel is a combination of three photographs showing the post buildings. One wall panel focuses on the history of the army’s coast artillery corps with photographs of soldiers in uniform and patches and pins. The museum officially opened on Veteran’s Day – Nov. 11, 2000. With this historical addition to Fort De Soto County Park, we hope to spotlight the historical significance that Fort De Soto played in the history of the United States. Fort De Soto Park’s Quartermaster Storehouse Museum project received a meritorious award in the category of non-residential restoration/rehabilitation from the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation during the 2001 Annual Statewide Preservation awards program held in Jacksonville on May 19, 2001. For a more detailed history of Fort De Soto please review our Historic Guide. Stay Connected Enter your email address to stay updated on the latest county news, events and opportunities.

Experiencing the outdoors and being surrounded by nature is great therapy for the body and soul. In Florida, there are 1.2 million physically-challenged people. With this in mind, the Friends of Fort De Soto Inc. decided, in 1997, to develop an interpretive nature trail that all visitors to the park could enjoy regardless of their physical capabilities. The idea was to create a self-guided interpretive program along the trail so visitors could use all their senses – touch, smell, sight and sound – to fully enjoy the experience. Fort De Soto Park staff and Sawgrass Lake Park naturalists worked together to design the trail to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. The Boy Scouts and other volunteer groups then built the 2,200-foot-long trail using recycled materials. Raised timbers are placed 8 feet apart for guidance and to allow enough space for wheelchairs to pass side-by-side. Concrete strips alert visitors to the interpretive stations or rest areas. Interpretive stations have signs and touch-activated speakers to provide information about the trail. Rest areas have benches and water fountains. The Barrier-Free Nature Trail opens the natural world for all visitors to enjoy. The Friends of Fort De Soto Inc. and the many dedicated volunteers involved in this project hope you enjoy the trail and visit often. Friends of Fort De Soto Inc. Mission Statement Our mission is to provide community support for the preservation and improvement of Fort De Soto Park through financial contributions as well as volunteer efforts. Our focus is to promote public awareness of Fort De Soto Park, its special environment and facilities and, through improved communication and special projects, to bring awareness of the need for historical and environmental preservation and conservation. The Friends of Fort De Soto Inc. is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions to Friends of Fort De Soto are tax deductible to the extent allowed under current tax laws.

Gulf Pier, on the west side of the park, remains open Project Status Construction: Completed Project Overview Pinellas County removed the existing Fort De Soto Park Bay Pier and constructed a new pier in the same location. The new pier was constructed of concrete piling, concrete beams and a concrete deck. A shade structure was built at the top of the ramp to the dock for the Egmont Key Ferry, and fish cleaning stations were provided for fishermen.  Low-level deck lighting was also provided along the pier with special pole lighting at the waterward end. The original Fort De Soto Bay Pier was built in 1943, reconfigured in 1960, and reconstructed in 1984. A significant repair was performed in 2007. With continued deterioration, the pier was scheduled for replacement. A grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provided $1 million for the project’s environmental assessment and design. Construction cost in the amount of $4,764,300 was funded by the Penny for Pinellas.

By: Keely McCormick , Mary O'Connell Posted and last updated PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. — Fort De Soto Park's North Beach reopened on Monday after parts of the park have been closed for months following last year's back-to-back hurricanes. Fort De Soto Park is the largest park in the Pinellas County park system, spanning 1,136 acres. Monday marked a major phase in hurricane recovery as the beach welcomes visitors back. The storms caused flooding in the park facilities, damaged boat ramps and fishing piers, and destroyed hundreds of trees. Debris was spread along the beaches and campsites. The county said it was a major effort between staff and volunteers to clean up and reopen. “We appreciate the patience of our residents and visitors as we bring Fort De Soto closer to full operation,\" Paul Cozzie, director of Parks and Conservation Resources, said. \"This park is a cherished part of Pinellas County, and we are excited to welcome everyone back in time for the spring break season.” Some areas, like the East Loop and parts of the seawall near the historic site, are still closed, and access to boat ramps is also limited because of repairs. \"Campground is now fully reopened. We had a lot of electrical issues in there. Went and rebuilt 240 electrical pedestals,\" said David Harshbarger, the park manager. \"We really appreciate the public's patience. We just want to make sure things are safe when folks get back out here, so this morning, being able to take down that last barricade, just a nice success to get people back on the beach.\" Regulars wasted no time getting back on North Beach, lounging in the sun and taking a stroll on the sand, saying they're happy to be back months in the making. \"I did miss it, so when I saw that the North Beach was going to open today, I made this my outing for the day,\" said Joni Reeder.

While the ramp is available, only one floating dock is open to the public. Plans to construct new floating docks are underway, with completion expected by early 2026. Please exercise extreme caution when using the ramp. There are two boat ramp cleaning days scheduled for  Aug. 16 and Oct. 11, 2025. There will be rolling lane closures during this time but slips will still be available to the public. Fort De Soto Shelters without Picnic Tables Ft De Soto Park lost 250 picnic tables from unprecedented storm surge and its related destruction caused by the recent hurricanes. We have enough tables to outfit fully eight shelters (2, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15). The remaining seven (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10) shelters await replacement tables.  All 15 shelter structures are sound, and all damaged grills have been repaired. Park patrons are welcome to bring their own chairs and tables to our shelters. Please respect any shelters listed as reserved, whether or not they are outfitted with picnic tables. Some Areas of Fort De Soto Park Remain Closed Areas such as the East Loop and portions of the seawall near the historic site are closed to the public due to storm damage. Whether you are sitting on the beach or kayaking near the still water’s edge at Fort De Soto, you find yourself absorbed in the abundance of natural beauty as far as the eye can see. The complexity of the ecology is not immediately apparent, but the park offers the greatest diversity of systems just about anywhere. Emerging from the wealth of bird life, sea life, wildlife and plant life is the majestic tapestry called Fort De Soto. The largest park within the Pinellas County Park System, Fort De Soto park consists of 1,136 acres made up of five interconnected islands (keys). These keys are home to beach plants, mangroves, wetlands, palm hammocks, hardwoods and scores of native plants. Each of these species plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of the natural environment. Another amazing example of the importance of the park’s natural ecosystems is the more than 328 species of birds that ornithologists have documents over a 60-year span. New species are added every year. The beach also provides refuge to the loggerhead sea turtle, which nests between April and September. Fort De Soto was named America’s Top Beach for 2009 by Tripadvisor, the world’s largest online travel community. In 2005, “Dr. Beach” named Fort De Soto the nation’s No. 1 Beach. Fort De Soto named among the top 10 best dog-friendly beaches in America (2024). Fort De Soto named among the top 10 beaches in 2024 by Dr. Beach. Annual park attendance averages more than 2.7 million visitors.

In 1941 the property was sold back to the federal government for $18,404 to be used as a gunnery and bombing range during World War II. The property was repurchased from the United States in 1948 for $26,500. The 12-inch mortar battery, located at the fort for which the park was named, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Adding to the historical interest at Fort De Soto, two British breech-loading, rapid-fire rifles of 1890 vintage were installed in March 1982. Markers showing the original building locations and a Quartermaster Storehouse Museum add to the park’s historic interest.

Pinellas County Park manager shows ‘catastrophic’ damage to Ft. DeSoto Park, details recovery efforts by: Beth Rousseau Posted: Nov 15, 2024 / 06:34 AM EST Updated: Nov 15, 2024 / 09:18 AM EST by: Beth Rousseau Posted: Nov 15, 2024 / 06:34 AM EST Updated: Nov 15, 2024 / 09:18 AM EST SHARE PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) – Several parks and beaches in Pinellas County are still closed, more than a month after Hurricane Milton. State and local leaders are expected to update on the recovery process, on Friday. David Harshbarger, park manager at Fort DeSoto Park said the damage is worse than he expected. “We’ve had flooding issues, but nothing like this where every structure went underwater, every infrastructure piece was underwater,” Harshbarger said. Tampa Bay Rays to play 2025 season at Yankees’ spring training field Harshbarger showed 8 On Your Side storm impacts from Helene and Milton. “Helen did most of that damage with the surge. Milton followed it up a week and a half later with lots of damage,” Harshbarger said. At the campgrounds, trees are toppled on buildings, electrical outlets are unusable and more than 200 picnic tables washed away or have to be replaced. Crews have cleared most of the debris. It’s stacked in huge piles on the side of the road, awaiting removal. “We are certainly on the schedule, that’s part of the issue of getting open. You drive through those neighborhoods on the beaches and there’s still trash, there’s still debris. The park is important, but we have to make sure our community is in good shape as well,” Harshbarger said. At the beach, some of the seawall is blown, boardwalks are water-damaged and Harshbarger is worried about buried debris. “We are going to have to come in and rake some portions of the beach because of how much Milton buried. We can’t have a kid out building a sandcastle and find a rusty nail down in the sand,” Harshbarger said. According to the park manager, it could take up to a year before some areas of the park are accessible to the public. “The second we can get some people safely into the park. We’ll get them to any area we can,” Harshbarger said. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
