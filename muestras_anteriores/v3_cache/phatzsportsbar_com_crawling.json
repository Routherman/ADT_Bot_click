The new restaurant will have a full bar and outdoor patio — and bring back the Soul Food Sunday Brunch, said Tessa Adams, who co-owns Phatz with husband Robert and son Antoine Barber, all Treasure Coast natives. “We’re just doing a revamp with a new name and new vibe,\" she said. “We rented across the street, but they didn’t want to sell to us, so we decided to go and do our own thing — a sports bar that’s Black-owned.\" Rendering of the new Phatz Sports Bar & Grille located at 421 N U.S. Highway 1 in Fort Pierce. They aim to have \"the finest sports bar on the Treasure Coast,” with the same menu that includes their top-selling Buffalo wings with their signature fingerlickin sauce as well as tacos, never-frozen burgers and hand-breaded seafood.

U.S. 1, where it razed the former Ace window tinters and Baslow Hentschel Motors buildings to make room for the new restaurant. Phatz began with two food trucks and the original restaurant at 1529 Avenue D in Fort Pierce, known as the Chronicle Newspaper building, which they still own. They moved to the current rented location in August 2020.

It was in business only a year, from September 2020 to December 2021. Now that location is home to Palos Tacos. Phatz still uses a trailer for catering.
