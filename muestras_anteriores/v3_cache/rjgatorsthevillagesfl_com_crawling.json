Gator's Florida Sea Grill & Bar Dear Prospective franchisee,\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in the franchise development opportunities which exist within R.J.Gator's Franchise Systems, Inc. As you are undoubtedly aware, the R.J.Gator brand is a powerful and growing casual dining concept. I developed R.J.Gator's after years in the foodservice industry and, like you, I recognize the value of a well-established brand - a brand that has stood the test of time, we began in 1986, and prospered. It is my absolute belief in the power and potential of the R.J.Gator brand that brought me to this great system, and it has been my pleasure to add further velocity to its momentum.\r\n\r\nR.J.Gator's has made quantum leaps in progress from the little 100 seat wine & beer restaurant founded in 1986. In doing so, however we have not lost sight of those time tested elements of the R.J. Gator concept which have successfully built the brand for over the past 19 years.\r\n\r\nToday, there are many R.J.Gator's Restaurants in several states. Most of these locations are franchised, illustrating the commitment that R.J.Gator's has to franchising as its primary manner of doing business.\r\nAgain, thank you for your interest in R.J.Gator's Restaurants.\r\n\r\nReginald Tim Timoteo\r\nFounder-President Chief Executive Officer Facts & figures Liquid capital required ARS40,000 Dear Prospective franchisee, Thank you for your interest in the franchise development opportunities which\nexist within R.J.Gator's Franchise Systems, Inc.
