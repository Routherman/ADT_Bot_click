The property was handpicked by our owner, who envisioned a course that would offer a fun yet challenging game for golfers of all skill levels, making it an experience unlike any other and a must visit destination. With the expertise of our Superintendent, Steve Keller, who has been with us since we opened in 2007, and the dedication of our amazing staff, Juliette Falls continues to be ranked in recognitions such as the Top 10 Courses in the Nation and Top 3 in Florida year after year! Book Your Tee Time Proud to announce that Juliette Falls is \"Best of Florida Golf Courses 2025\" by The Guide to Florida Thank you for voting! Explore our Course Hole 9 Hole 13 Hole 18 Hole 9 Hole 5 Hole 16 What Sets Us Apart Drainage Our course is renowned for its exceptional drainage, staying playable no matter the weather. Thanks to our pure sand-based property, we experience zero restrictions after rain events, ensuring the course remains firm and fast. We’ve never had to close due to flooding, not even after those famous Florida hurricanes! terrain Unlike much of Florida’s typically flat landscape, Juliette Falls boasts significant elevation changes throughout the course, creating a distinctive challenge for golfers. Notable holes like 8, 12, 13, and 15 feature dramatic rises and falls that add both beauty and strategy to the game. We began with a naturally rolling piece of land, and our course design was carefully crafted to highlight the unique topography of the property. Rather than flattening the landscape, we incorporated its natural features into the design to provide golfers with a dynamic and scenic experience. This thoughtful integration ensures that every round feels fresh and exciting, with each hole offering something special. Maintenance At Juliette Falls, we take great pride in our summer aerification process, which plays a key role in keeping our course in pristine condition. We perform three rounds of aerification each summer, once in June, July, and August, over the course of just four days each month. Because our dedicated crew works tirelessly to complete the job efficiently and effectively this process is completed in just 4 days each time. During aerification, we perform deep punching, rolling, and thatching to improve air circulation, water absorption, and root growth, all while maintaining fast and firm playing conditions. This rigorous process ensures that our course remains in excellent shape, even through Florida’s humid summer months, and ready for play every day.

The course's strength lies in the variety of its par-4s and the standout quartet of par-3's, two of which feature Daliesque greens that seemingly melt into the water. One of the strengths of the course is its combination of playability and strategy. There’s plenty of width for the recreational golfer to play an enjoyable round and at the same time there’s strategic shot options that will challenge the best players in the game. Juliette Falls meanders over a portion of the 546 acres of equestrian land in the Ocala countryside. The area features horse farms similar to that of Kentucky bluegrass horse country. It was named a Golfers' Choice 2022: Top 50 U.S. Courses.
