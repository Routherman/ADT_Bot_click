Download our Volunteer Application or stop in at the Kane Center to fill one out in person. Return your application to the front desk at the Kane Center or mail it to the address below. We will contact you once your information is received. Currently, We're not accepting any new volunteers at this time . Council on Aging Martin County, Inc. 900 SE Salerno Road Stuart, FL  34997 Volunteer Opportunities Adult Day Club The Adult Day Club provides a safe, nurturing environment with medical supervision for seniors who benefit from Club services, exercises and other activities. Volunteers can serve food or help with activities and crafts. We also welcome musical performers or others who can entertain our Club members. Meals on Wheels Monday through Friday, our volunteers deliver hot, nutritious meals to homebound elders through our Meals on Wheels program. These volunteers can sometimes be the only friendly face a lonely senior will see during the day and are a valuable resource for making sure an older person living alone is OK. Training takes just 30 to 45 minutes and can be scheduled at your convenience. Assigned routes are convenient to your home or businesses, or you can request a specific route. Volunteering with Meals on Wheels takes just two hours each week. You can share a route with someone, or your school, business or organization can adopt a route to share. If you can't commit to a fixed schedule, we need \"on call” volunteers to fill in for regulars who might be away for a few days or weeks. Volunteers use their own vehicles to pick up the meals at distribution sites, then deliver them between 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. You'll need: A valid driver's license and an insured vehicle. A completed Meals on Wheels volunteer application. Two clean coolers to transport the meals. You will complete training prior to making your first delivery. We can arrange for you to team up at first to become acquainted with your Meals on Wheels clients. Clerical Volunteers are routinely needed in the Council on Aging office to answer phones, file and help with fundraising and newsletter mailings.  With over 6,500 newsletters distributed regularly, this is no small task! Our gang of \"Super Stuffers” is on call to help the Development Department assemble mass mailings and prepare them for distribution by the Post Office.  But it’s not all hard work.  On mailing days, our volunteer crew members enjoy coffee, doughnuts and socializing.  Their good deeds are also good fun! Fundraising As with any non-profit organization, the Council on Aging relies on the generosity of private donors to help us fulfill our mission of providing professional and compassionate care to seniors in Martin County. To help raise money and awareness for the Council, we hold a variety of special events throughout the year, such as a fashion show and our annual Sage Awards.  Our fund raising volunteers act as support staff in organizing these events.  They work closely with our Development Department to ensure that vital programs such as Meals on Wheels, adult day care and more are available to the seniors who need them.  It’s a fun and fulfilling way to volunteer! Bistro The Kane Center Bistro offers a tasty array of snacks, beverages and lunch selections.  We rely entirely on volunteers to staff the Bistro. Duties include running the cash register, helping customers select their refreshments, and serving items such as soup and crock pot meals. Town Center Help us make the Kane Center a welcoming place for all. Greet and direct visitors. Sell tickets to upcoming shows and events. Provide visitors general information about our programs and services and conduct Kane Center tours.

We were founded as a private, 501(c)(3) organization in 1974 to provide services tailored to the specific needs of seniors. More than 50 years later, we are the longest-serving senior services agency in the county offering the most comprehensive resources for elders, their families and their caregivers. Our Mission and Vision Our mission is to be the unparalleled resource of expertise, programming and support for seniors in Martin County. Our vision is to inspire a community that embraces, uplifts and encourages seniors to maintain lives of quality and purpose. We provide programs in support of this mission, including Meals on Wheels;  an adult day program; senior-focused primary medical care; care management; caregiver support; and a robust offering of educational, cultural and wellness programs specifically designed for seniors. Our History More than 40 years ago, several concerned Martin County residents put a small ad in the local newspaper, announcing a meeting to discuss forming an organization to help seniors in need. Over 200 people packed the tiny meeting hall. Their consensus regarding the needs of the elder community: feed the homebound, transport the frail and disabled, and cut through the red tape seniors and their families face when trying to find assistance. The consensus of needs in the community and commitment to meet those needs resulted in the formation of the Council on Aging, which was incorporated in 1974. Since its founding, the Council on Aging of Martin County has consistently grown and excelled in the senior service area. 1974 Our Founding The Council on Aging of Martin County founded. 1974 1976 Meals on Wheels The Council launches the first Meals on Wheels program in Martin County, delivering 20 meals daily. Today, over 250 meals are delivered Monday through Friday county-wide. Nutritional services have also been expanded to include Senior Dining Centers and monthly grocery options. 1979 Lead Agency The Council is designated as \"Lead Agency” for Martin County under the Community Care for the Elderly Act. 1979 1987 First Adult Day Care Center The Council creates the first licensed adult day care center in Martin County, which has grown from 12 seniors per day to the capacity to serve 90 seniors per day. 2003 Prestigious Award The Council's Nutrition Services/Meals on Wheels program is awarded National Certification through the Meals on Wheels Association of America. The program is one of only four in the state of Florida and 46 nationwide to earn this recognition. 2003 2006 Initial Funding for Kane Center The Council receives a $5 million appropriation from the State of Florida to be used toward the creation of a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose senior center, kicking off a $15 million public/private capital campaign to build the Charles and Rae Kane Senior Center. May 2011 Moving Day The Council officially moves its operations to the Kane Center, which opens its doors in May 2011. May 2011 February 2012 Kane Clinic Open for Business The Kane Clinic begins operation in the Kane Center, offering primary geriatric specialty medical care in a medical environment designed to address the multiple health care needs of the elderly.

Costs are continuing to increase and our staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to prepare, package and deliver more than 500 hot, healthy meals, each weekday, to the seniors who most need them. Funds raised by Poinsettia Power help ensure that the seniors on the waiting list for government-funded meals do not have to wait, hungry and alone. You Can Make a Difference in the Lives of Seniors!

Thank You to Our Top Sponsors! Help Us Fight Senior Hunger and Isolation. We can’t wait to hear the hustle and bustle of the holiday spirit as it fills the Town Center at the Kane Center with holiday vendors and happy shoppers picking up gifts for friends, family, and of course something for ourselves. Today, the Meals on Wheels program prepares and packages an average of 500 meals daily, delivered by over 200 loyal and dedicated Meals on Wheels volunteers. All proceeds from Poinsettia Power benefit Meals on Wheels, our flagship program, which has been serving Martin County's seniors for 48 years. We hope we can count on your support this year to help Meals on Wheels continue to provide this life-saving safety net service. We can’t do it without You! Your gift means the world to our seniors: Too weak or unsteady to safely cook When the choice is between medicine and food When both spouse and caregiver are infirmed When a senior is homebound, ill, or frail For many of these vulnerable seniors, our volunteer may be the only person they see on a given day. Having someone who cares helps reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness. Thank you for helping ensure our seniors remain healthy, safe, and connected to a supportive community.

Remembering Kathryn Spencer It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Kathryn (Kate) Spencer, a dedicated member of our Board of Directors. Kate started volunteering with us as an active member of the Finance Committee in 2014. In October 2016, she was elected to the Board of Directors. A year later, she was elected to serve as an Officer, which in the capacity of Treasurer, she also assumed the position of Chair of the Finance Committee. Displaying her innate leadership skills and commitment to the organization, Kate was elected as Board Chair in 2018 and served in that position until 2021, followed by assuming the post of Immediate Past Chair for three additional years. Kate continued to serve as a member of the Board of Directors for the Council on Aging of Martin County (COA) until her passing on March 11, 2025. Kate was the epitome of a volunteer leader. Her governance was always marked by her camaraderie amongst Board and Committee members, as well as staff. She didn’t just attend meetings or lend her name to a cause, she constantly introduced new candidates to the Finance Committee and the Board of Directors, ensuring that fresh voices and ideas had a platform to help shape the COA initiatives. Kate shared her talents and resources, going above and beyond in support of the COA’s work. Her contributions were not just about what she gave, but the way she gave it – with an open heart and a spirit of collaboration. Kate displayed a genuine interest in the well-being of others. During her association with the COA, Kate never hesitated to give of her time and energy for the greater good. Her commitment to senior issues was clear not only through her presence at the many COA functions and fund-raising events that she attended, but through her true advocacy for seniors. Kate also had the distinctive ability to flawlessly engage, guide and inspire others to join her in the COA’s mission to serve seniors in our community. Kate embodied the values of commitment and compassion. She was a guiding light for all of us, and her legacy will continue to inspire and influence the work of the Council on Aging of Martin County for years to come. We are deeply grateful for the time, energy, support, and love she dedicated to our cause. Kathryn (Kate) Spencer will always be remembered as a cornerstone of our efforts and an invaluable member of our community. Join Our Team!
