      "text": "JAZZ CHILL : SMOOTH JAZZ RADIO RETURNS TO ORLANDO! Thursday, August 18, 2011 SMOOTH JAZZ RADIO RETURNS TO ORLANDO! Smooth Jazz will soon be returning to Orlando, Florida. The two translators that Central Florida Educational Foundation had leased to Cox to simulcast 580 WDBO have been returned to their owner as Cox moves its programming to 96.5. There are also applications on file to complete their moves from Winter Park, FL to Orlando itself. 102.5 W273CA (formerly W274AX) will now be leased to Clear Channel, who will use it to rebroadcast 107.7 WMGF-HD2. The station will pick up the Smooth Jazz format recently dropped by 103.1 WLOQ after its sale. SmoothJazz1025.com was registered by Clear Channel yesterday is and is currently in a partially active state. Programming will come from Broadcast Architecture’s Smooth Jazz Network. Much like its earlier launch of The Oasis in Detroit, Smooth Jazz can now be heard on FM transmitter 102.5, which is owned by Clear Channel, with a simulcast on 107.7 WMGF hd-2 \"We are thrilled to be in a position to bring Smooth Jazz from Broadcast Architecture back to Central Floruda,\" Clear Channel Pres./Market Manager Linda Byrd said. \"Today it’s very easy to deliver a format to its listeners via HD, FM, online and mobile. And that’s exactly what we are doing.\" \"We’re delighted to be able to provide local Jazz music fans with such a well-produced product that is clearly at the top of its game,\" added Clear Channel/Orlando Program Director Ken Payne. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to assist Clear Channel/Orlando in bringing Smooth Jazz music back for the over 200,000 listeners disenfranchised by the recent switch of WLOQ,\" Broadcast Architecture Owner/Pres. Allen Kepler said. \"This marks our third return of the format this year! Recent convert Smooth Jazz 104.7, The Oasis in DETROIT is already reaching over 130,000 listeners and KBDB-A/Reno debuted with a 1.0 share, which truly shows the format’s potential on an AM signal.\" Posted by Jazz Chill at 10:37 PM Email This BlogThis!

I sure hope you fix the problem because we miss you!!!! We get mixed stations now that we can't fix and I hope you listen to our appeal and repair the problem. Thank you in advance. Diane P. 4:43 PM Anonymous\nsaid... I am thrilled to learn that Orlando will have a Jazz station once again! 11:02 PM Anonymous\nsaid... Thank You So Much, Clear Channel, for picking up WLOQ after Gross had to sell it. I understand it was for health reasons. It left a BIG space where smooth jazz use to be. Now It's Back!! Unfortunately, it's not complete yet. There are no local dj's, no local programing, and no RDS. It's basically just simulcasting a web site right now. I truly hope that Clear Channel has plans to bring back the old WLOQ...the way it use to be!! I particularly want my Sunday programing back, starting with \"Landscapes\" on Sunday morning, then \"Latin Jazz\" and \"Sounds of Brazil\" Sunday night! I miss them so much. Please Clear Channel, let us know your plans. Please bring back our WLOQ!! Again...Thank you!! 6:56 PM Anonymous\nsaid... I was beginning to wonder...what in the world am I going to listen to. Very pleased to hear you're back in town! CONGRATULATIONS!!! I remember the ole days when we had jazz in the Peabody rooftop. 11:22 AM Anonymous\nsaid... Please fix the transmition problem asap becsuse evem in Orlando SE and SW we can'tget good signal, and we miss this statio a loooootttttt. THANK YOU. 2:21 PM Anonymous\nsaid... The original Jazz Station we used to listen to (WLOQ) 103.1 was \"the bomb\" - the replacement 102.5 was ok but still miss the original.  I can't believe they are both gone.  I know there is a WANT and NEED for a jazz station in Orlando...it is truly sad. 4:46 PM Anonymous\nsaid... just moved back to town and haven't been able to find any jazz on my radio...? did this ever materialize? 2:32 PM Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) LinkWithin Follow @Jazz_Chill Search This Blog Popular Blog Posts Benergy – Ben Basile’s Debut Solo Album Blends Ska, Jazz, and Personal Stories Acclaimed bassist Ben Basile , known for laying down the low end with ska-punk legends Big D and the Kids Table , has just dropped his debut...

After careful planning and preparation, the first annual Florida Smooth Jazz Weekend was launched in January 2015 at the Crowne Plaza Melbourne Oceanfront.  Drawing fans from throughout the United States and internationally, the Florida Smooth Jazz Weekend quickly found its way to be a “must attend” event for smooth jazz fans from throughout the United States and beyond. A sell out since the second annual Florida Smooth Jazz Weekend in 2016, the fourth Florida Smooth Jazz Weekend was moved to Daytona Beach in January 2018 followed by the fifth event in January 2019.  The sixth event date was pulled forward to November 2019, continuing to sell out every time.  The COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the November 2020 event to November 2021 which became sold out five months before the scheduled event.  The ninth event Nov. 2-5, 2023 was sold out before July 1.  The 10th Anniversary event, Oct. 31-Nov. 3, 2024, sold out in January of 2024! The Daytona Jazz Weekend at One Daytona was created in 2021 as a complimentary Spring event to The Florida Smooth Jazz Weekend in the Fall.  An exclusive, intimate smooth jazz getaway with seating for less than 330 guests in an outdoor tent, it is located at One Daytona, the exciting new restaurant and shopping complex.  Guests enjoy accommodations at The DAYTONA, a Marriott Autograph Collection hotel, and at The Fairfield Inn & Suites, combining unique activities at Daytona International Speedway with our “Cruise on Land” philosophy.  Despite the challenges of development during the COVID-19 pandemic, the inaugural event debuted in May 2021 as a sell out and again in March 2022, March 2023, and February 2024. The Fifth Annual Daytona Jazz Weekend March 27-30, 2025 is certain to be sold out again! Daytona Beach has proven to have the perfect sites to provide the hospitality and quality that the Florida Smooth Jazz Family has come to enjoy! The Florida Smooth Jazz Foundation The Florida Smooth Jazz Foundation Inc., a Florida nonprofit corporation, is a 501(c)(3) public charity that was founded by Cathy Powers in 2005, organized and operated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes.  The Foundation promotes and produces music events for the greater good of the community, and supports activities fostering music education and other charitable organizations.

Within three years, SFJ had taken over full production of the event that would consistently present a plethora of jazz legends and stars, while also featuring the very best of the abundant Florida jazz artists, both professional and collegiate, over three days and nights. The Hollywood Jazz Festival was the signature jazz event for the region through 2005. The SFJ seasonal concert series, which began in 1996, is acclaimed for its superior talent, literally from around the globe. Our cultural partnership with Bailey Hall that began in 2018, gives “South Florida JAZZ at Bailey Hall” an outstanding presentation venue from this time onward. South Florida JAZZ is a nonprofit cultural arts organization presenting live jazz concerts and educational programming under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Our Mission The mission of SFJ is to offer performance venues for musicians – local, regional, national, and international – whom it regards as treasured talents; nurture the next generation of jazz musicians and enthusiasts to perpetuate this unique art form; network with other cultural arts organizations to expose larger numbers of people to authentic jazz music of various styles; and assume an advocacy role for student and professional musicians.
