They guide, advise and support our Chief Executive, who leads the Executive Board towards achieving our vision and purpose. Our Register of Interests and Articles of Association are available on request from enquiries@maggies.org Stuart Gulliver Chairman I first heard about Maggie’s from the staff at HSBC when I was Group Chief Executive who told me about the great work Maggie’s does for people with cancer. I was intrigued and wanted to see it for myself. I went to the West London centre and a one-hour tour became a three-hour visit as I learned more about the people, the building and the approach to cancer care. Stuart joined our Board of Directors in 2018 and became Chairman in May 2021. He is Chair of Maggie’s Finance and Investment Committee and a member of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. Stuart has more than 38 years of international banking experience and played a leading role in developing and expanding Global Banking and Markets at HSBC. He has held key roles in the Group’s operations worldwide, working in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and the United Arab Emirates. Former appointments include Group Chief Executive of HSBC from 2011 to 2018, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chairman of HSBC Bank plc, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA and HSBC France. He was also Deputy Chairman of HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG and a member of its supervisory board. Stuart is currently a board member of Jardine Matheson, The Saudi British Bank and Aramco. Dame Laura Lee DBE Chief Executive I have seen first-hand, the remarkable difference that access to a Maggie’s centre makes to a whole community and I am determined that everyone affected by cancer has their own Maggie’s. Laura has led Maggie’s since its inception in 1995. She was our first Centre Director at Maggie’s Edinburgh and became Chief Executive in 1998. Laura worked as a Clinical Nurse Specialist at the Western General Hospital where Maggie was treated. She worked with Maggie on the blueprint for a different model of cancer care: a non-clinical place in the hospital grounds where people with cancer and their families and friends could find practical, emotional and social support.

Her illustrious career resulted in two Oscars, four Emmys, a Tony, seven BAFTA Awards, and a British knighthood. ﻿ Jump to: Who Was Maggie Smith? Quick Facts Early Life Early Career in Theater and Film Movies and TV Shows: The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Downton Abbey, and Harry Potter Husbands and Children Quotes Who Was Maggie Smith? Dame Maggie Smith led a distinguished, varied career on stage, in film, and in television over six decades. Her achievements range from starring as Desdemona in Othello opposite Laurence Olivier in the 1960s, to winning an Academy Award for her performance in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , to memorable roles in the acclaimed television series Downton Abbey and the popular Harry Potter movies. She died in September 2024 at age 89. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Margaret Natalie Smith BORN: December 28, 1934 DIED: September 27, 2024 BIRTHPLACE: Ilford, England SPOUSES: Robert Stephens (1967-1974) and Beverley Cross (1975-1990) CHILDREN: Toby and Chris ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn Early Life Maggie Smith was born Margaret Natalie Smith on December 28, 1934, in Ilford, England, just outside of London. Her parents were Margaret and Nathaniel Smith. When Maggie was 4 years old, her family moved to Oxford, where her father worked as a pathologist at Oxford University. Maggie studied at the all-girls Oxford High School until the 16-year-old left to attend the Oxford Playhouse School from 1951 to 1953. She made her professional stage debut in 1952, playing Viola in an Oxford University Dramatics Society production of Shakespeare ’s Twelfth Night . Early Career in Theater and Film After a brief detour to New York’s Broadway, where she performed in the comedy revue New Faces of 1956 , Smith also began to act in movies. Her first role was a short, uncredited appearance in Child in the House (1956) followed by a larger part in the crime drama Nowhere to Go (1959). In the 1960s, Smith was active in the National Theatre of Great Britain. She played Desdemona to Laurence Olivier ’s Othello in 1964; the two of them reprised their roles in a film version of Othello the following year. While at the National Theatre, she acted in classic dramas by major authors such as Henrik Ibsen and Anton Chekhov . Movies and TV Shows: The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , Downton Abbey , and Harry Potter Smith received two Academy Awards throughout her career. Her first Oscar arrived in 1970. She received the Best Actress trophy for her portrayal of an idealistic, unorthodox schoolteacher in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969). Nine years later, Smith won Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Neil Simon ’s California Suite (1978). The actor also received British Academy Film Awards for her work, including for her roles in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , 1984’s A Private Function , 1985’s A Room with a View , and 1987’s The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne . Among the accolades for her stage performances were a Variety Club Award for her performance in Noël Coward’s Private Lives in 1972 and a Tony Award for Lettice and Lovage in 1990. Throughout the 1990s, Smith acted in a diverse range of projects, from the 1993 comedy Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit with Whoopi Goldberg to the 1997 literary adaptation Washington Square and the 1999 ensemble drama Tea with Mussolini . Her appearance as a snobbish aristocrat in Robert Altman’s Gosford Park (2001) received especially positive notice. Smith captured the attention of a new generation when she played the strict witchcraft teacher Minerva McGonagall in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001). The movie was a huge hit, and Smith reprised the role for six of the seven Harry Potter sequels. Beginning in 2010, Smith earned acclaim for her performance as the grandly irrepressible Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, in the period drama Downton Abbey . She received three Emmy Awards for the role in 2011, 2012, and 2016. The esteemed and busy actor also continued her prolific movie career. In 2012, she joined the ensemble cast of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and was featured in the Dustin Hoffman–directed film Quartet . In 2015, she returned for The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and starred in the comedy-drama The Lady in the Van , for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination. Husbands and Children Smith was married twice. Her first marriage, to actor Robert Stephens in 1967, ended in divorce in 1974. Her two sons with Stephens, Toby Stephens and Chris Larkin, are both actors. In 1975, Smith married writer Beverley Cross, who died of cancer in 1998.﻿ Smith was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. In 2008, Smith was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent intensive treatment that included chemotherapy sessions which coincided with the filming schedule for Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince . Quotes It’s true I don’t tolerate fools, but then they don’t tolerate me, so I am spiky. Maybe that’s why I’m quite good at playing spiky elderly ladies. I like the ephemeral thing about theatre, every performance is like a ghost—it’s there and then it’s gone. Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
