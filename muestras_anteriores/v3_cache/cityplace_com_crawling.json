Find an eBook on: Find a copy of the Ebook Amazon Apple Google Kobo Description Details This Place Is Who We Are profiles Indigenous communities in central and northern coastal BC that are reconnecting to their lands and waters—and growing and thriving through this reconnection. Indigenous peoples and cultures are integrally connected to the land. Well-being in every sense—physical, social, environmental, economic, spiritual and cultural—depends on that relationship, which is based on a fundamental concept: when the land is well, so are the people. With increasing strength, Indigenous peoples in this vast region of BC—which spans the homelands of more than two dozen First Nations and one of the largest remaining coastal temperate rainforests in the world—are restoring what has been lost through environmental depredation and healing what has been devastated by colonization. This volume is a collection of ten of these inspiring stories. X̱aayda voices explain how their Rediscovery camps are healing and empowering their youth; Dzawada̱’enuxw Hereditary Chief Maxwiyalidizi K’odi Nelson shares the story of building a healing centre and ecolodge; Wei Wai Kum Chief Christopher Roberts describes the challenges and opportunities for an urban First Nation looking to prosper while protecting the environment and ancient Ligʷiłdaxʷ history and living cultural values; and many more Indigenous leaders share their own experiences of growth, strength and reconnection. Thoughtful and inspiring, This Place Is Who We Are illustrates what can be accomplished when conservation and stewardship are inextricably intertwined with the prosperity and well-being of communities. Prize(s): Winner Jeanne Clarke Award (2024), Short-listed Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Book Prize (2024), Runner-up BC Historical Writing Award (2023) “Katherine Palmer Gordon, a consummate listener, weaves a powerful tapestry of ten First Nations people, deeply grounded in land, memory and story. Their lives honour the inextinguishable inter-connectedness of humans and nature, in righteous defiance of colonization. These are stories that point to an optimistic future based on the teachings of Ancestors and Elders with a view to making the world better for children, grandchildren and children yet to come. To do this, human wellbeing and land protection must be inseparable. This book is an encounter with wonderful people doing wonderful things. This Place is Who We Are is an invitation to hope for a better society, a better world, featuring ten people creating it. I thank the contributors and Katherine Palmer Gordon for engaging in a visionary conversation.” –Shelagh Rogers, O.C. Host/Producer of The Next Chapter , CBC Radio One, Honorary Witness, Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada “A beautiful collection of stories and lived experiences! Each with gentle and loving reminders of our sacred connections to each other, the land and water and all living beings. Individually, these stories are inspiring, hopeful and thought provoking. As a collection, majestically woven together by Katherine Palmer Gordon, they have the potential to change hearts and minds of readers, decision makers and future generations.” –Monique Gray Smith “An astute facilitator of Indigenous governmental relationships and reconciliation, Katherine Palmer Gordon is also an award-winning writer, and a very good listener who earns trust. These deeply personal accounts of Indigenous cultural rediscovery, empowerment—and healing in a post-colonial world—are truly inspiring. Steeped in ancient connections with the land, the shared wisdom and vision of elders, youth and community leaders offer timely lessons for a healthier, more respectful relationship between people, wildlife and our planet. This is good medicine for all.” –Mark Forsythe, Co-author of The Trail of 1858: British Columbia's Gold Rush Past and former CBC Radio host Harbour Publishing ISBN: 9781990776137 Paperback / softback 8 in x 10 in - 256 pp Publication Date: 06/05/2023 BISAC Subject(s): NAT011000-NATURE / Environmental Conservation & Protection,SOC062000-SOCIAL SCIENCE / Indigenous Studies,BUS094000-BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Green Business Description This Place Is Who We Are profiles Indigenous communities in central and northern coastal BC that are reconnecting to their lands and waters—and growing and thriving through this reconnection.

      "text": "These major changes are coming to downtown West Palm Beach's CityPlace News Sports Restaurants Real Estate Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals WEST PALM BEACH These major changes are coming to downtown West Palm Beach's CityPlace Alexandra Clough Palm Beach Post Stephen Ross, chairman of Related Ross, said he is working to transform West Palm Beach into a model city that will be in \"the most important county in the United States.\" To get there, Ross will continue to upgrade downtown's CityPlace, a massive mixed-use project that changed downtown when it opened in October 1999. New developments were shared by officials after March 12 groundbreaking of the company's newest planned office towers, 10 and 15 CityPlace, at Rosemary Avenue and Hibiscus Street. Ross, also owner of the Miami Dolphins , said: \"We are doing everything we can to bring all the amenities and activities needed to sustain the growth we're looking at today.\" Some of those include: ∎ Related Ross development company is hoping to strike a deal with Publix to build a new West Palm Beach grocery store that would be nearly double the size of an existing store at CityPlace . ∎ More restaurants and furniture stores will take space at CityPlace. ∎ The opening of the Eataly Italian Market in the historic Harriet Himmel Theater this year. 15 CityPlace and 10 CityPlace towers More: The Square complex in West Palm Beach reverts to its former, beloved name: CityPlace The 15 CityPlace tower, and a companion tower next door dubbed 10 CityPlace, will add 1 million square feet of office space to the downtown when completed in 2027. Some 4,700 employees could work in the towers when they are fully occupied, said Ken Himmel, president of Related Ross. The 25-story, 500,000-square-foot 15 CityPlace tower is 60% pre-leased to office tenants, officials said. More: West Palm's new office tower One Flagler opens as Related Ross works on other projects Among the building's many perks is a 6,000-square-foot rooftop amenity deck, said the tower's architect, Bernardo Fort Brescia, co-founder of Arquitectonica. These tenants included the previously announced Cleveland Clinic Florida medical offices, which will total 120,000 square feet. They also include two newly revealed tenants: Shutts & Bowen, Related Ross' law firm and a current tenant of another office building owned by Ross; and Inclenberg Investments, a private real estate investment firm with an office in Palm Beach. The size of these office leases was not disclosed. Is a larger Publix coming to CityPlace? As for a larger Publix, Himmel said talks with the Lakeland-based grocery chain still are underway, and Related Ross needs to buy one additional piece of property for a new, larger store. The new store would be built at the northwest corner of Banyan Boulevard and Rosemary Avenue, a few blocks north of the current Publix store at Fern Street and Rosemary Avenue. Talks have been ongoing with Publix for five years, Himmel acknowledged, but the grocery chain previously backed away from opening a larger store at CityPlace. However, in the past couple of years, with the surge in the city's population and upgrades being made to the CityPlace district, a bigger store once again is a possibility, he said. Food hall Eataly could draw more than 1 million visitors The $45 million Eataly market will feature 30,000 square of interior space, plus outside seating. The market is being built in the historic Harriet Himmel Theater. Mayor Keith James, who attended the groundbreaking, said Eataly will attract further interest in the city. \"You want something that will bring people from all over the county, maybe all over the region, and I think Eataly will be a great draw,\" James said. Himmel said Eataly also is a draw for restaurants hoping to get spillover business from the foot traffic and customers who visit the food hall. Other new restaurants coming to CityPlace In fact, more than half a dozen restaurants are slated to be built at CityPlace in the next few years, Himmel said. Among them is Moxie's, a Canada-based chain that does $17 million a year in revenue at each of its two other locations in South Florida. In addition, a restaurant will be built inside the cottage that once housed the former Hibiscus House Bed & Breakfast, a property that Related Ross now owns. Home furnishing stores to open at CityPlace Home furnishings are an important element, too, in the CityPlace retail lineup. Perigold, part of the Wayfair furniture company, will open at the end of the year, and Crate & Barrel will open at CityPlace, too, joining West Elm at the center. As for the existing RH store on Okeechobee Boulevard, just south of CityPlace, that store does more than $80 million in volume, the third busiest store in the company's chain, Himmel said.
