Beers and burgers a winning combination at 11th annual North Miami BrewFest Beer education event is a huge success Business & Entrepreneurship By Ivonne Yee-Amor November 22, 2023 at 11:25am The people have spoken and when it comes to beer and food, it seems wildberries, Japanese rice lagers and hamburgers are their top choice. That’s because craft brewery Rocketeer Beer & Liquid Provisions of Kendall and craft burger restaurant La Birra Bar in North Miami took home the top spots and the People's Choice Awards for Best Brewery and Best Eatery, respectively, at this year’s 11 th annual North Miami BrewFest , produced by and benefiting FIU’s Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management . “It’s an honor to be here every single year, and we are privileged to take first place. We are humbled,” said Rocketeer Beer co-owners Rudy Delgado and Rick Abreu as they reveled in their win. Last year, the craft brewers took home third place. This year the two upped their game by offering the more than 1,300 attendees seven different beers, one that had wild blueberries and blackberries in it and another made with Japanese rice lager. Three local craft breweries took home the hardware for best brewery. From left to right: Brewers Rudy Delgado and Rick Abreu of Rocketeer Beer & Liquid Provisions came in first place, team member Ramon San Martin of Prison Pals Brewing Co. voted second, and Anastasia Fraga, marketing director for Johnny Cuba took home third place. Nearly 40 distinguised craft breweries and more than two dozen eateries took part in the event, serving more than 100 one-of-a-kind beers and bites. This year the largest crowd ever turned out for event at its new venue, the NOMI Village off 123 rd Street and I-95, not far from FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus. “We are very happy about this win,” said Emmanuel Arballo, co-owner of La Birra Bar, a craft burger joint appearing for the first time at the festival. While it may have been their first time at BrewFest, it’s not their first FIU-related win. They took home Best Burger at last year’s Burger Bash at the Food Network South Beach Wine & Food Festival presented by Capital One (SOBEWFF®) . “It was an amazing experience and the student volunteers were great and very detail oriented,” added Arballo. The three best eateries included two burger joints. From left to right: La Birra Bar in North Miami took home first place, El Desembarco in Miami came in third, and Off the Hook Churrascaria in Miami came in second place. The event is produced by the Chaplin School and helped run by its students. Many are members of student clubs such as event production club Back of House , the Bacardi Center of Excellence Bartender's Guild and the school's award-winning student-run restaurant, the FIU Bistro . The event's mission is to contribute to brewing science education and innovation for the craft brewing industry, brewpubs and homebrew organizations. As for the best beers and bites, who else took home top prize? Best Brewery: 1 st place Rocketeer Beer & Liquid Provisions 2 nd place Prison Pals Brewing Co. 3 rd place Jo hnny Cuba Best Eatery: 1 st place La Birra Bar 2 nd place Off the Hook Churrascaria – a Brazilian fusion steakhouse 3 rd place El Desembarco Festivalgoers 21 and older enjoyed more than 100 brews and bites. The event is produced by FIU Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management staff and supported by more than three dozen student volunteers. More than two dozen exhibitors, like Rocketeeer Beer & Liquid Provisions, are part of the growing craft beer industry.

Campus & Community Pour me another cold one: date for North Miami Brewfest announced Save the date: November 12, 2022 By Ivonne Yee-Amor July 14, 2022 at 2:10pm Florida's best craft brewers and beer lovers will gather again this year in South Florida for the North Miami Brewfest . Today, event organizers announced the yearly gathering is scheduled to take place on Saturday, November 12, 2022, so save the date. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the one-day festival, which began at Florida International University’s Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management on FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus. Back then, the event was student-led and started to showcase the best brews from FIU's Brew Science program, alongside the industry's emerging talent. Today, more than a thousand people gather to taste more than 150 one-of-a-kind beers and bites from the area's most distinguished craft breweries and restaurants. The event is produced by FIU and is the only local beer festival that offers a beer and food pairing. Get a chance to speak one-on-one with South Florida's best craft brewers and taste some unique flavors. \"Beer is one of the top five most consumed beverages in the United States and its popularity is why innovation and education in the craft brew industry is important,\" said Barry Gump, professor and Harvey R. Chaplin Eminent Scholar Chair in beverage management and the creator of the school's brewing science program. According to the not-for-profit trade group representing small and independent U.S. Brewers, the Brewers Association, craft beer sales went up 7.9% in 2021 resulting in nearly $27 billion dollars in sales. That number is expected to grow this year. Craft brewers, considered small and independent, make up 98% of all breweries in the U.S. FIU alumni, like FIU hospitality graduate and Temple Street restaurant co-owner Alex Kuk, '04, MS '10, have historically taken part in the event. The North Miami Brewfest will take place at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Plaza on NE 125th Street in the City of North Miami . For the past five festivals, North Miami has been the Title Partner. One of South Florida's most popular breweries, Funky Buddha , is among the first to announce it will be sharing its creative ales during the event. The Chaplin School's Brewing Science program is open to all students. The top 10 U.S.-ranked hospitality school also offers a bachelor's degree in hospitality management with a beverage management track. The degree is meant for students who want to work in the beverage industry focusing on wine and brewing arts. For more information about the degree, please visit the FIU Chaplin School website or for more information about the 10th annual North Miami Brewfest, please visit, northmiamibrewfest.com for more details.
