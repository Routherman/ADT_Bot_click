Millions come to AmazingRibs.com every month for high quality tested recipes, tips on technique, science, mythbusting, product reviews, and inspiration. But it is expensive to run a website with more than 2,000 pages and we don’t have a big corporate partner to subsidize us. Our most important source of sustenance is people who join our Pitmaster Club. But please don’t think of it as a donation. Members get MANY great benefits. We block all third-party ads, we give members free ebooks, magazines, interviews, webinars, more recipes, a monthly sweepstakes with prizes worth up to $2,000, discounts on products, and best of all a community of like-minded cooks free of flame wars.

Dial thermometers are often off by as much as 50°F so if you are not using a good digital thermometer we probably can’t help you with time and temp questions . Please read this article about thermometers . 4) If you are a member of the Pitmaster Club, your comments login is probably different. 5) Posts with links in them may not appear immediately.

Choose your task and time slot on Signup Genius: Note, the Signup Genius website works best from a ‘real’ computer, as opposed to some mobile devices. If you have any problems with the signup website please contact volunteers@rhythmandribs.net for assistance signing up to volunteer. ***IMPORTANT*** WE NEED EVERY VOLUNTEER’S FULL NAME. The best way to sign up friends, family and coworkers is for each person to sign up individually, so they choose exactly what they want, and they get email updates directly. If you want to be directly responsible for signing someone up, there are two options: If you want to add someone to work with you (like your significant other for example), choose 2 under Qty, and type the second person’s full name in the My Comment box . If you want to sign up on behalf of someone (like your sister for example), check the “Display as alternate name”checkbox, then type in that person’s full name in the boxes that appear. If you choose option 1 or 2 above, remember that you will get update emails and will be responsible for relaying that info to people you’ve signed up. Our festival relies heavily on our volunteer staff, so we ask that you be conscious of this and make responsible choices regarding signups . (Specific volunteer details and instructions will be sent out closer to the festival. So, make sure to provide a good email address, and keep an eye on your Inbox for emails from volunteers@rhythmandribs.net and SignUpGenius.) Still got questions? Please contact volunteers@rhythmandribs.net You will need to provide some basic information about yourself, and you’ll be able to see available time slots and tasks to be filled for this year’s festival. The St. Augustine Sunrise Rotary Club sees this festival as a true service to our community, both in the proceeds we donate, and in the festival itself providing inexpensive, high quality fun and family entertainment. Each year, this festival is 100% Volunteer organized throughout the year, and 100% Volunteer run throughout the 3-day weekend. Hold on! – That’s a LOT of work! Yes, but well, it’s good work, if you’re a part of it 🙂 The festival is a labor of love, and we could not do it without our many, wonderful community volunteers. Throughout the 3-day weekend, it takes over 200 volunteers working over 2,000 collective hours to make Rhythm & Ribs run. We invite you to come be part of this “feel-good” experience, and make new friends in the process. SEE YOU ‘ON THE FIELD’! Thank you! Service Above Self!

How to Structure your Staff Team It is strange how we operate on the same platform without knowing a thing about each other’s staff structure Roonie 3 min read · Apr 15, 2022 -- Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Thumbnail: jsph#9999 Moderation is necessary for every Discord server. I personally run a 11k Discord server and I have never seen the staff channels of my friends Discord servers and they haven’t seen mine. But who knows what goes under the hood? How do we form a system so perfect and efficient? We just have to wait long enough to figure it out ourselves. This trial and error method feels kind of a waste of time doesn’t it? How many Moderators do I need? You may have asked yourself this question previously. What’s the answer? It depends on your server activity level. “Doesn’t member count matter?” My old 100 member server can overtake my new 11,000 server in terms of activity any day. Funny enough, we didn’t even need moderators back then. Because we weren’t a community server. Just a few no life friends talking day and night. That is why server theme matters more than member count. The amount of members on your server, one way or the other, relates to your activity. 3️⃣ Start with three. I think three is a good place to start. Always remember, just because they’re active in chat doesn’t mean they are good moderators. Demoting someone is more work and trauma. Hire smartly instead. For the first batch, consider getting some of your discord-experienced friends As your activity starts to grow, and when you get outnumbered, or chat is active in the uncovered part of the time zones, that is when it’s time to get new staff members. Roles Structure Here’s my staff team role structure: Admin Moderator Trial Mod Management Pretty basic right? It does the job. “Management” is the base staff role for all moderatos as a part of them being in the team. Have an administrator for around every 5 moderators. Unless you chose to have Senior Moderators. Staff Channels Structure: A private #staff-chat and #staff-commands is necessary. What’s also worth implementing is a #staff-guide handbook so new moderators know exactly how moderation works in your server. Mention in there what violations cause what type of punishment. A private #staff-news channel doesn’t sound like a bummer. You can use it to update moderators on various announcements only staff needs to know. You can also have a #staff-suggestions to let you staff members suggest different things to be implemented into the server. Proof of Violation: A channel for moderators to post the mod action they made against a user. They shall also mention why they punished the user along with a screenshot. Discord themselves recommend keeping track of mod cases manually. If you are a server owner, feel free to ask for suggestions or feedback on Netcord’s Official Discord server! We’d love to help you out. I was alone when setting mine up, you don’t have to! Thank you for reading — see you tomorrow!

FAQ Where will Rhythm X be operating? Rhythm X will be based out of Franklin, Indiana again for the upcoming season. Individuals from any geographic location are encouraged to apply, as every season we have members and staff coming from across the country. Is there a Facebook group I can join? Join our Facebook group here to ask more questions, see who else is interested in auditioning, potentially find car pools, etc.: https://www.facebook.com/share/XiDjntGrpsDuRCGz/ What is the age limit? As per WGI stipulations, performers shall not be over 22 years of age as of 12:01 AM on April 1, 2026. There is not a bottom age limit to audition or attend the clinics, though most performers who end up making the ensemble tend to be age 18+. Can I do a video audition? In-person auditions are the best way to be considered for a spot in the ensemble. Attending in person allows us to provide personalized feedback and evaluate your skills in a live environment, giving you the best opportunity to showcase your abilities and interact with staff. Video auditions are reserved for exceptional circumstances and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. To be eligible for a video audition, you must have several years of relevant DCI/WGI experience. Exceptions to this policy are rare and are at the sole discretion of the Rhythm X staff. We understand the desire for feedback on your progress. We invite you to join the official Rhythm X Facebook interest group, where you can share videos and receive peer and staff comments. Please note that any videos shared or feedback received in this group will not be considered as part of the official audition process. What are the audition requirements for the visual ensemble (VE)? Due to the nature of modern Visual Ensemble, auditionees will be evaluated on site in regards to quality of Dance, Movement, Flexibility, and Adaptability. Auditionees should come prepared to showcase Technique in the Art of Modern Dance, including but not limited to; Jazz Dance, Lyrical Dance, Hip Hop Dance, Acrobatic Dance, and Contemporary Dance. The Expectation will be that all auditionees be led through a Stretch and Flexibility block. A Dance Basics and Dance Technique block, including Across-The-Floors. And at least two Dance Routines taught live, and evaluated on Comprehension, Technique, Performance Quality, and Adaptability. Can I audition even if I don’t live near Rhythm X? Yes! We encourage individuals from across the country (or globe!) to participate in our auditions. While Rhythm X mainly practices and performs in the Midwest, every year we have members from around the country. In the past, we’ve also had members from Belgium, Japan, and Colombia. If you earn a spot, you’ll have to make arrangements to move to Indiana or drive/carpool if you live within driving distance. What should I bring to auditions? - Audition materials printed out in a binder - Pencil - Water bottle - All sections may spend some time outside, so please make sure to wear comfortable & weather fitting clothing - Sticks and a pad for playing along (for battery auditionees) What is expected of me if I make Rhythm X? All members are expected to attend weekend rehearsals from Friday evening-Sunday afternoon from December through April, as well as attend a camp in between Christmas and New Years. Members also must be able to attend WGI Championships which includes events during most of the week leading up to Finals. Members are responsible for paying member dues; the dues for the 2023-2024 season were $2,100. Member dues cover rehearsal sites, equipment, contest fees, staffing, uniforms, props, and other ensemble related needs. During rehearsal weekends, members must make their own arrangements for housing, transportation, and food. Meals may be provided on show days. I bought just the packet, and now I want to audition. Please reach out to contact@rhythmx.org and we can give you a discount code to purchase the audition registration for $40 off (the price of the packet). What is the schedule for auditions?
