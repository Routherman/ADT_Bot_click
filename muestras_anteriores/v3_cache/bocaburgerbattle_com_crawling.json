After its success, I moved to the U.S. with the dream of building something new. In Boca Raton, a chance meeting with CPA Monique Troncone led me to her husband, Stefano De Fraia Frangipane—Neapolitan, born just 100 meters from my father’s family home. Though a dental professional, he shared my passion for Italian food. Together, we founded Le Tre P Food (Pizza, Pasta, Panini), a small holding now managing four ghost kitchens: – Studio Burger – gourmet burgers – Sono un Italiano – fresh pasta with iconic sauces – 13 Pizze – authentic Neapolitan pizza, ready in 90 seconds Italian-American Food – classic Italian-American dishes And finally, 13 Mangia & Bevi in Fort Lauderdale: a deli where you enjoy 1 glass of wine + 3 tastings of fine Italian food.
