In Planet Coaster 2 you’re responsible for the management of your staff, including hiring, training and potentially firing new members of your team. Successfully managing your staff can be the key to running a profitable theme park and Planet Coaster 2 provides a range of tools to help you lead your staff to success. Types of Staff Staff in Planet Coaster 2 come in all shapes and sizes, each performing their own functions in your theme park. Janitors Janitors are responsible for cleaning your theme park and keeping it spotless for guests to enjoy. A clean park is a happy park, so Janitors are important to your park’s success. Janitors will clean rubbish and vomit, clear bins and benches, and also scrub Toilets and Changing Rooms around your park. Janitors will also repair any vandalised objects within your park. Ensuring you have enough Janitors is key if you want to have a spotless park! Ride Attendants Ride Attendants are new to Planet Coaster 2 and operate your park’s rides and Transport Stations. Ride Attendants are essential for your park to run, and guests cannot get on the ride or transport without a Ride Attendant. Vendors Vendors are responsible for operating all of your park’s shops. You can’t serve your guests without them, so you’ll need to make sure you have enough Vendors on your staff schedule to cover the demand! Lifeguards Lifeguards are responsible for keeping the pools around your water parks safe for guests to enjoy. Lifeguards are assigned to Lifeguard Chairs or Lifeguard Posts and can only watch the area within range of their Chair or Post. While on duty, they will assist guests who panic in the pool within their area. Mechanics Mechanics work on machinery in your park, like rides, generators, water pumps, and transport stations, keeping everything working as intended. Mechanics automatically head over to machines that need repair or servicing. They can also be called over to refurbish machines to get them back into tip top condition. Mechanics also fill another vital role in your park, generating research points at the Mechanic Workshop. These points are then used to complete new areas of research in the Park Management panel, unlocking new rides and experiences for your guests. Entertainers Wearing a variety of fun and fabulous costumes, Entertainers will walk around the park and enhance your guest’s experience. Entertainers who wear branded costumes will make nearby guests more likely to gravitate towards the shop they’re advertising. Entertainers who wear themed costumes will also help satisfy guests’ Entertainment need . new areas of research in the Park Management panel, unlocking new rides and experiences for your guests. Security Guards Security guards protect your park and guests by keeping a watch out for crime, ejecting pickpockets and vandals, and discouraging littering nearby. Unassigned Guards will patrol your park automatically, keeping an eye out for criminal activity, chasing any miscreant that they spot or who is reported by one of the parks security cameras. You can also assign a Security Guard to a Security Post to keep them monitoring the surrounding area. The pace at which Security Guards can chase suspects is based on their Morale, so be sure to keep them happy! Hiring & Firing Staff As you run and expand your theme parks in Planet Coaster 2, you’ll need to hire – and occasionally fire – staff to work in your park. How to Hire Staff Staff members can be hired through the Staff Browser menu: Open the Staff Browser menu. Select the staff member you want to hire. Place them in your park. Once placed, staff members can be assigned to specific jobs and zones using the Staff Schedule menu. Did You Know? Staff members can be automatically hired when you build a new ride or shop if the “ Auto-hired once open ” option is available. How to Fire Staff Staff members can be fired via their info panel or in the Staff Management screen. Be careful – once a staff member has been fired, they can’t be re-hired, so make your decision carefully! How to fire staff through their info panel: Select the staff member. Select the Fire button in the bottom right of their info panel. How to fire staff through the Staff Management screen: Find the staff member you want to fire in the list. Select the Fire button on the far right of the screen. Staff Morale Morale is a reflection of how happy your staff members are while working in your theme parks. Morale is calculated at the end of every day and is affected by your staff’s pay and breaks. Staff can be: Very Happy Happy Content Unhappy Miserable Learn more about how Staff Morale works, along with tips to help improve Morale in our Keeping Staff Happy guide. Staff Pay You must pay each of your staff members to work in your park, with different staff members having different pay rates. The amount you pay each of your staff members can be customised with Pay Tiers, setting Low Pay, Fair Pay or High Pay – the amount you pay your staff will directly impact their Morale. Fair Pay – all staff begin at this tier automatically, which has no positive or negative consequences to their Morale. Low Pay – saves you some pennies, but decreases Morale. High Pay – costs the most, but nothing improves Morale like being highly paid! Pay Tiers can be changed at any time and an average of the Pay Tiers used will be calculated at the end of the day to factor into your Staff Morale. Staff Breaks Staff members will need a Break if they work for more than 4 hours in a single day, otherwise their Morale will decrease. Breaks are taken in Staff Rooms which you’ll need to build and maintain around your park. Staff Rooms have a maximum capacity, so you’ll need to make sure that there are enough Staff Rooms spread around your park for all your staff members to take their scheduled breaks. Staff members will need to spend a minimum of 5 in-game minutes in a Staff Room for their break to count and will automatically leave the Staff Room after 10 in-game minutes to work on their next assignment. Did You Know? Staff Morale has a direct impact on how fast a staff member works and moves around. You can quickly check a staff member's Morale in their info panel. Staff Zones Staff Zones can be created around your park to split it into smaller parts – each with their own colour and icon. By default, any Staff assigned to these zones will limit their work to the zone, allowing you to control where your Staff are working in your park. Staff not assigned to a zone, will work across your entire park. Staff Zones are key to efficiently manage Staff across your park, and ensure their work is evenly split and within a reasonable distance. They can also be a great tool to review the performance of different areas of the park – learn more about this in our Park Management guide. HOW TO CREATE A STAFF ZONE You can draw Staff Zones in your park with the Brush Tool. Open the Staff Browser menu. Select Staff Zones . Select Create New in the top right corner of the screen. Customise the colour and select an icon for your new zone. Draw your new Staff Zone directly on to your park. Once done, select Done in the top right corner of the screen. You can now name the zone, view stats or make further edits to the zone area. HOW TO ASSIGN STAFF TO A STAFF ZONE Staff can be assigned to Staff Zones to improve efficiency. Staff members will focus on the Zone they’ve been assigned to, rather than walking long distances around the whole park. Open the Staff Schedule menu. Switch the view to Zone View in the top right. Open Advanced Settings. Select the Staff Zone you want this staff member to focus on in Work Preferences. This preference can be applied to all blocks for that member with the Apply All-Day option. The Staff member will now focus on completing jobs within the assigned Staff Zone. Staff Schedules The Staff Schedule allows you to set what staff members are doing throughout the day, along with setting which Zones they are working in. By default, staff work every hour of a day doing their default task and are scheduled for one break. Work Blocks are how you plan out your staff’s daily schedules. Work Blocks are set to the staff member’s type of work by default, but the Advanced Settings allow you to select a specific type of work or a specific work target for that block. Break Blocks last an hour and can be scheduled for any time except at the very start or the very end of the day. Empty Blocks mean that the staff member is not working, and not getting paid. There cannot be empty blocks in the middle of the day, but blocks can be emptied at the start or end of the day to make a staff member’s day shorter. Did You Know? Staff schedules repeat every day, meaning that any changes are carried across to the next day too. How to Edit a Staff Schedule Staff schedules can be fully customised and edited to get the most out of your staff members, keeping them happy and your theme park running. Open the Staff Schedule menu. Select a block on a staff member’s schedule. Toggle between a Work Block, Break Block and Empty Block to change how the staff member behaves on the selected block. Use the Advanced Settings menu to further customise the block and set more specific behaviours e.g. set a staff member to work in a specific shop. share: Facebook Twitter phrase.email Table of contents Types of Staff Hiring & Firing Staff Staff Morale Staff Pay Staff Breaks Staff Zones Staff Schedules Previous Guide Facilities More guides Beginner Restaurants Restaurants are perfect for building eateries into the themed areas of your parks, with plenty of different food options to choose from.
