Purchased by the Creighton family in 2013, one of their goals was to take the course to a higher level by upgrading course conditions and constantly making improvements. Dave Creighton Sr. owned and operated several courses in Florida starting with Northdale Golf Club from 1980 to 2000. Other courses include Rosemont, Kissimmee, Celebration, Countryway, Lexington Oaks and now Fox Hollow. Dave Sr. had a 21-year professional hockey career including 11 seasons in the NHL with the Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers. Son Adam followed his dad’s path into professional hockey with a 14-year NHL career, including two years with the Tampa Bay Lightning (1992/93 and (1993/94). Since the Creighton’s purchased Fox Hollow in 2013, they have continued to upgrade the course each year.  Because of this, the course and amenities have been taken to a higher level. Opening in 1994, the Fox Hollow golf course has the distinction of being one of the last courses designed and built by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., one of the most prolific and innovative golf course designers of all time. In his design of Fox Hollow, the legendary Jones created a layout as picturesque as it is playable. Quite simply, Fox Hollow offers a good, fair test of golf. The par-71 championship layout features five sets of tees and offers new challenges every time it’s played, mixing native trees and vegetation, sparkling lakes, sand bunkers and a variety of wildlife. Fox Hollow’s rolling fairways are a delightful departure from the pancake-flat layouts found elsewhere in Florida. The putting surfaces at Fox Hollow feature SeaDwarf Paspalum, a hearty turfgrass that can be irrigated with effluent, reclaimed, or even seawater. This grass also has the ability to deliver fast green speeds (9+ on the Stimpmeter) and requires less fertilizer, pesticide, weed control and irrigation. Arguably, Fox Hollow possesses some of the finest quality, most environmentally friendly green complexes in the Tampa Bay area. Convenience and an emphasis on friendly, unobtrusive service also contribute to the Fox Hollow experience. From the time you drop off your clubs until you reach the first tee, everything you need is readily accessible. The 15,000 square foot clubhouse is the focal point, featuring a fully stocked pro shop, locker rooms, private meeting rooms and an upscale dining room to serve as an alternative to the more relaxed atmosphere of the “Grille at Fox Hollow Golf Club.” Both share spectacular views of the 10th and 18th holes of the golf course. If awards are what you’re looking for, the Tampa Tribune has placed Fox Hollow on its list of top three public-access courses in all of west central Florida; and Central Florida Magazine says the 18th hole, with its forced carry off the tee and water running the entire length of the hole on both sides of the fairway, is simply the “Best Par 4 in Florida”. Water comes into play on 11 holes and Jones’ other signature feature – plentiful, profound and penal bunker complexes – abounds. Fox Hollow has hosted local qualifying for the U.S. Open as well as qualifiers for the Valspar Championship, the PGA Tour event held annually at Innisbrook Golf Resort. Events The Fox Hollow clubhouse is available for tournaments, private parties, weddings, receptions and dinners, all catered by its professional events staff. The staff will help design the menu, handle the details and have the golf course in impeccable condition for your event. They handle tournament groups from 20 to 144 players. Competitive pricing is available. For more information, visit FoxHollowGolfClub.com or call (727) 376-6333. Practice Facilities As you exit the clubhouse, Fox Hollow’s practice facilities are all within easy walking distance. The practice facility consists of a grass driving range with over 25 hitting stations, a chipping green with a practice bunker, and a 10,800 square foot practice putting green. Lessons and clinics are available, taught by Fox Hollow’s highly experienced PGA & LPGA professional teaching staff. Memberships Three attractive golf membership packages are available: Junior, Intermediate and Regular. Both single and family memberships are available in all three categories. Regular and family members may book tee times up to fourteen days in advance. Daily Fee Players Welcome Fox Hollow is a semi-private club. Another initiative taken by the Creighton family is a significant reduction in the rate structure. Playing Fox Hollow has never been more affordable. Reserve tee times online at FoxHollowGolfClub.com or call the pro shop at (727) 376-6333.

Thanks to our close proximity to the M3 and M25, we couldn't be easier to get to. Find us . CEO, Marc Hayton, and his family have owned the club for 40 years. Always striving to provide members and guests with a unique country club experience so that when you leave, you feel better than when you arrived. 1780s The mercurial 18th century politician Charles James Fox came to live in the area in the 1780s with his mistress and former courtesan Elizabeth Armistead. A brilliant young parliamentarian (MP for Midhurst aged just 19), Fox was a passionate orator with an appetite for gambling and the high life; he once made a wager with the Prince Regent as to the number of cats they would see on Bond Street, and survived a shot in his ample belly during a duel in Hyde Park, quipping he would have died had his opponent, William Adam, not used the government issued gunpowder. A member of the Prince of Wales’ set, Fox never endeared himself to the establishment of George the Third. Neither did his intellectual support for revolutionary causes in France and America, nor his espousal of civil liberties and slave emancipation. When ill health struck, and gambling debts forced him out of London, Fox sought to restore his body and spirit in the peace of his country estate and company of his neighbour and friend Sir Joseph Mawbey at Botley Park. He returned to public life in 1801, before his death in 1806. 1817 Sir Joseph did not long outlive Fox and estate broke up upon his death in 1817. His son-in-law, John Ivatt-Briscoe, bought the area then known as Fox’s Hill and France Farm. A successful lawyer and local MP, Ivatt-Briscoe commissioned the architect Basevi, cousin to Disraeli whose work included Ely Cathedral (Cambridge), to build the current Manor House. A prodigy of the great Classicist Sir John Soane, Basevi designed the Manor to reflect the spirit of the new Victorian age in its restrained charm and elegance. As an MP, Ivatt-Briscoe was concerned with local issues, helping to found the Chertsey Agricultural Association, whose annual ploughing match is held to this day. His only national initiative was to campaign for the outlaw of the treadmill as a form of punishment! 1870s In the 1870s, the estate was passed to a distant relative of Ivatt-Briscoe, General Hutton. A veteran of the Zulu and Boer wars, Hutton took an active role in parish life and invited the families of men who fell under his command to play in the grounds during their holidays. 1920-1990 After serving as a convalescent home for wounded officers during the Great War, the estate was sold to the Borthwicks, a successful merchant family in the 1920s. They ran the estate and farm in a manner unchanged since Ivatt-Briscoe, with a staff totalling 15 including a second chauffeur, Trevor Francis and third housemaid, Evelyn. Fraternisation amongst staff was not encouraged and when their relationship was discovered, she was forced to leave the estate. The couple subsequently married in 1940, and in 1990 returned to the Manor House to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. 1960-1975 During the Second World War, the family energetically turned the farm – now the site of the Bernard Hunt golf course – over to the Dig for Victory campaign. By the 1960s, a gradual decline had set in and saw the estate sold before being turned into a golf club in 1975, owned by Aer Lingus and known as Foxhills. 1983-Present Pam and Ian Hayton purchased the club in 1983, with their son Marc taking over as Managing Director in 2005. Marc is now CEO of the Foxhills Collection with Tej Walia taking over as Managing Director in 2023. In addition to strengthening the club’s reputation as a family-friendly leisure destination, Foxhills has expanded its sporting facilities far beyond a simple golf course to cater for the diverse interests of its members and visitors. With a growing membership and a strong reputation as a business and leisure destination, the love of food, wine and gracious living which Charles James Fox displayed in the 18 th century lives on.

Purchased by the Creighton\nfamily in 2013, one of their goals was to take the course to a higher level by upgrading course conditions and constantly making improvements. Dave Creighton Sr. owned and operated several courses in Florida starting with Northdale Golf Club from 1980 to 2000. Other courses include Rosemont, Kissimmee, Celebration, Countryway, Lexington\nOaks and now Fox Hollow. Dave Sr. had a 21-year professional hockey career including 11 seasons in the NHL with the Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers. Son Adam followed his dad’s\npath into professional hockey with a 14-year NHL career, including two years with the Tampa Bay Lightning (1992/93 and (1993/94). Dave’s other son Dave Jr. is an accomplished PGA golf professional. He has spent his career managing the family’s golf course properties. When the Creighton’s purchased Fox Hollow in August of 2013 they immediately started upgrading the facility. New machinery was purchased for golf course maintenance and different maintenance\npractices were followed to ensure that the golf course is always in great condition. The restaurant and banquet room also went through a facelift and were upgraded with new furniture and décor in\n2014. Opening in 1994, the Fox Hollow golf course has the distinction of being one of the last courses designed and built by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., one of the most prolific and innovative golf course\ndesigners of all time. In his design of Fox Hollow, the legendary Jones created a layout as picturesque as it is playable. Quite simply, Fox Hollow offers a good, fair test of golf. The par-71 championship layout features five sets of tees and offers new challenges every time it’s played, mixing native trees and vegetation, sparkling lakes, sand bunkers and a variety of\nwildlife. Fox Hollow’s rolling fairways are a delightful departure from the pancake-flat layouts found elsewhere in Florida. The putting surfaces at Fox Hollow feature SeaDwarf Paspalum, a hearty turfgrass that can be irrigated with effluent, reclaimed, or even seawater. This grass also has the ability to deliver fast\ngreen speeds (9+ on the Stimpmeter) and requires less fertilizer, pesticide, weed control and irrigation. Arguably, Fox Hollow possesses some of the finest quality, most environmentally friendly\ngreen complexes in the Tampa Bay area. Convenience and an emphasis on friendly, unobtrusive service also contribute to the Fox Hollow experience. From the time you drop off your clubs until you reach the first tee, everything you need\nis readily accessible. The 15,000 square foot clubhouse is the focal point, featuring a fully stocked pro shop, locker rooms, private meeting rooms and an upscale dining room to serve as an\nalternative to the more relaxed atmosphere of the “Grille at Fox Hollow Golf Club.” Both share spectacular views of the 10 th and 18 th holes of the golf course. If awards are what you’re looking for, the Tampa Tribune has placed Fox Hollow on its list of top three public-access courses in all of west central Florida; and Central Florida Magazine says the\n18th hole, with its forced carry off the tee and water running the entire length of the hole on both sides of the fairway, is simply the “Best Par 4 in Florida”. Water comes into play on 11 holes and\nJones’ other signature feature – plentiful, profound and penal bunker complexes – abounds. Fox Hollow has hosted local qualifying for the U.S. Open as well as qualifiers for the Valspar Championship, the PGA Tour event held annually at Innisbrook Golf Resort. Events The Fox Hollow clubhouse is available for tournaments, private parties, weddings, receptions and dinners, all catered by its professional events staff. The staff will help design the menu, handle\nthe details and have the golf course in impeccable condition for your event. They handle tournament groups from 20 to 144 players. Competitive pricing is available. For more information, visit FoxHollowGolfClub.com or call (727) 376-6333 Practice Facilities As you exit the clubhouse, Fox Hollow’s practice facilities are all within easy walking distance. The practice facility consists of a grass driving range with over 25 hitting stations, a chipping\ngreen with a practice bunker, and a 10,800 square foot practice putting green. Lessons and clinics are available, taught by Fox Hollow’s highly experienced PGA professional teaching staff. Memberships Three attractive golf membership packages are available: Junior, Intermediate and Regular. Both single and family memberships are available in all three categories.

Our goal is to provide an enjoyable and fulfilling experience ~ the kind that will help them develop maturity, good habits, and sound values. The improvement of our juniors’ golfing skills is just one objective of our program. Observing one’s own progress provides pleasure and satisfaction and is very important to any youngster. Working on fine motor skills also has its share of educational opportunities, such as exposure to the undeniable law of effort and reward – and its relationship to success and failure. However, skill improvement is not the only objective of our program. Fairness and equitable treatment, as taught through the rules of golf, are equally applicable to the rules of life in general. Courage, perseverance, and self-control are enduring values that can strengthen a youngster’s character through competitive golf. We look forward to helping each youngster develop skills in golf – a sport that is so aptly described as “the game for a lifetime.” Total Development Social Physical Emotional Educational Certainly one of the most important aspects of starting juniors in golf and in maintaining their interests is in providing proper golf equipment. Our goal is to make clubs available and affordable to our junior golfers. Our “clubs for kids” program is designed to get the juniors started and to ascertain their level of interest. Once the junior is “committed” to the game we recommend that you order top of the line manufactured models. Our golf professionals will offer club fitting advice to every junior in our program.
