Ranger Reviewed Jun. 27, 2021 The Ho Hum is Anything But The Ho Hum is a great little campground right on St George Sound near Carrabelle. The sites are gravel, level, and large enough. All are full hook-ups. There is a very nice bathhouse and laundry on the property, and a propane fill station. Our campsite was one tier back facing the water. We could sit in front of our trailer and enjoy the southerly breezes coming off the sound. Low key doesn't even describe the atmosphere at the campground. Many of the guests were fishing off the pier or from kayaks they could launch from the small beach area. Others had their boats anchored in nearby marinas and spent their days off-shore. Families who camped there loaded up in the morning and drove the 20 miles to St. George Island where there are some very nice public beaches and a lovely state park. The campground is near Apalachicola which has several small stores, restaurants, and a brewery. This is a great place to camp if you don't need to be entertained.

All pull through sites except for waterfront. Pier to fish from. Right on the Gulf. Facilities are clean. Share Report Harrison S. Guide Reviewed Jul. 26, 2020 Incredible Views This park isn’t the fanciest but it has some of the best views you can find. Our spot was about 20 ft from the gulf and waking up to the sunrise was fantastic. It seems to cater to folks without kids as the beach isn’t much of a beach and there isn’t much to do other than look at the gulf. We weren’t expecting much more than that so everything met our expectations. We had hoped to hang out on their dock but it was usually full of lawn chair fishermen so it wasn’t exactly enjoyable. Overall great park. Simple but full hookups on the beach, hard to beat that. (6) View All Share Report M Michelle H. Guide Reviewed Mar. 19, 2020 Great small campy Great little campground if you are looking for views and not amenities. Nice spots, the ones on the water are absolutely amazing. There is a small store, laundry and bathhouse. Staff is very friendly as are all the campers we have met. Dog friendly and fine for kids but be mindful that there’s not much to do except fish and walk on the small beach. Share Report Rosina E. Guide Reviewed Mar. 8, 2020 Pretty good Nice view and relatively easy set up due to pull through slots. Gravel makes stabilizers not as effective but not horrible. Restrooms were clean. Office staff was a bit surly with the people before me because the customer yawned lol. Come prepared with all supplies because they have little on offer to buy. Share Report Tami B. Scout Reviewed Mar. 4, 2020 Friendly and easy Great staff. Easy large spaces. Get the ones that back to the ocean. Best views there.  March there is little beach available and reminder the water here is brown.  Dog area (small). Cool pier that includes fishing license for guests. Share Report D David H. Scout Reviewed May. 15, 2019 Quiet, laid back, adults only. Beautiful view of The Gulf on scenic US98.

My only complaint about this park is that is was just an overnighter for us and we should have stayed longer!  On the water side of US98 near the historic town of Carrabelle, this is Old Florida beach vibe at its funky best.  Super friendly staff, big clean laundry room, shower houses, fenced dog park, and a 250 foot fishing pier make this park the perfect place to just relax and enjoy the views.  It’s right on the highway so a little bit of road noise but we still slept quite well.  We would 100 percent stay here again, probably for a couple of weeks.

Easy in and out and not to much road noise. I wanted to stay another night due to storms in the area and they could accommodate me but I had to move spots. Now as I look around the park and see it half empty I see no reason for me to move spots. Dissatisfied with that so we jest stayed the 1 night.

To be on the water was nice, but it's not really much of a beach - more of a fishing destination. The staff was friendly and helpful.
