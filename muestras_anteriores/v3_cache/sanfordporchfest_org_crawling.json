Sanford365's Porchfest Tips & Tidbits! - Sanford 365 Home About Calendar Blog The Latest Events Food For Kids Arts Businesses Real Estate Guides Subscribe Videos Find a Home Submit Event Advertise Contact Select Page How do you Porchfest? Sanford365’s Porchfest Tips & Tidbits! Feb 19, 2025 | 0 Article last updated 2/2025! Our favorite Sanford event (there, we said it!!) is just around the corner and even though many of you have already attended this fabulous community event (now in its 5th 6th 7th 8th year ), the event is still growing rapidly, and that means, tons of Porchfest newbies will be joining us this year! We couldn’t be more excited about that, so we wanted to take a few minutes to give everyone who has never attended, or anyone who needs a few little reminders about the festival, some of our top tips on how to do Porchfest… Remember, all the latest, most accurate information can always be found on the official Sanford Porchfest Event Page on Facebook . What does Sanford Porchfest sound like? Listen to the official Sanford Porchfest 2024 Playlist on Spotify here . Some of last year’s artists will attend this year again, so the playlist will give you a general idea of the Porchfest vibe 😉 Click here to download the 2025 Performer Schedule – 18 Porches and over 70 Bands! Now, let’s get started with the tips… What to bring: Cooler – for non-alcoholic drinks 😉 Lawn Chair/Blanket Reusable water bottle Cash – All of the porches have tip jars & the money goes right back into our community, more about this below. You will also come across kids raising money by selling things such a lemonade and cookies! Wagon , backbacks or something to carry around your Porchfest gear (or pals) easily Snacks or pack a picnic (support local businesses, we recommend stopping at the Sanford Farmer’s market or Magnolia Square Market for sandwiches and other items, or grab a coffee at one of the coffee shops downtown.) Sun protection : Sunscreen/Hat, sunglasses Comfy clothes and shoes for getting around Hand wipes (towels) Flashlight – Porchfest continues after dark so plan on making it back to your car or Downtown safely. Your Porchfest Outfit !! We get asked every year where we got our Porchfest tanks and shirts. The answer is simple: at the merch booth – BUT : you must come early!! These shirts sell out almost every year and if you want to look the part, you don’t want to miss out on these special (collectible) shirts. We actually wear them proudly year round! Your Game Plan : If you have time to come up with a Porchfest game plan ahead of time using the o nline map , write down your “must sees” as well as bands that might interest you, but in our experience, you’ll end up where you might least expect it in the end, just because the atmosphere and vibe was perfect in the moment. So our tip is: go with the flow, and discover new bands, and make new friends, that’s what Porchfest is all about! A Positive Attitude and a Grateful Heart – Porchfest is an amazing community event and brings all of us together so be sure to be kind to one another and just enjoy the day! It takes a lot to make Porchfest happen and there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes before, during, and after Porchfest, so if you see someone in a volunteer shirt be sure to give them a high five! Thank the artists and vendors. And please remember that you are hanging out in a neighborhood and watching the bands live on someone’s porch so be sure to respect the area you are in. Dance. Smile. Eat. Laugh. Chat. Sing along and simply enjoy this amazing day! Tips for going with kids : Kids will be kids! Let them have fun while they play tag, blow bubbles, etc. We suggest making an attempt to leave the sports balls at home as we don’t want them hitting others with them nor do we want them running into the street after them (although this year all streets will be converted into pedestrian zones). We suggest making sure you pack enough snacks to keep those active kids going. Invite their friends!! Encourage the kiddos to enjoy the music and have a dance off. NEW this year: Special thanks to our KIDS ROCK! experience sponsor, The Learning Experience stop by Park on Park with the littles during the event to get crafty, explore with creative play, and meet new neighbors. Porchfest is a family friendly event and typically has little activities at (almost) every porch for the kids. You’ll find activities such as  chalk, so kids can decorate the sidewalks. In the past there has been a large fence piece that kids and adults alike are encouraged to paint on. In the past we have also seen lawn games setup, but maybe it would be a good idea to bring a portable bean toss or similar yard game of your own! Photos by Jessica Carvajal Photography Tips for going with pets : Don’t forget the leash, pets must be kept on a leash. Don’t forget water for your furry friend, we think they’d appreciate some snacks, too. Be aware of your pet and their reactions, check on them often and make sure they are okay with the large crowd and loud music. Doggy bags, be courteous and please pick up after your pet. Where should I park? Residents of the historic district will be very thankful if you could park anywhere in the designated FREE public parking lots around historic downtown. Below is a useful map that shows the best parking locations. From most of these locations it will only be about a 5-10 minute walk until you get to the first porch. But trust us, it will be a beautiful walk, on a beautiful day (have you checked the weather forecast yet?). Parking closer to the restaurants and bars in historic downtown is actually not a bad idea because that way you will certainly be tempted to stay for a little longer after the event and end the evening at one of our local businesses with a meal or drink (or better yet, both!).  There will also be a block party on Sanford Avenue following the event ( Sanford Avenue Block Party ). New this since 2023 is a FREE Trolley Service (sponsored by AAA Cares ) with designated trolley stops that will bring you from your parking spot closer to the bands and more. Please see the map below or c lick here to download : How to get around? Golf Cart , Bike, Walk We recommend walking since that is the best way to really get a feel for the beauty of the historic district. You get to experience what it means to live in this amazing neighborhood and since all the porches are so close together it won’t take you too long to get all the porch hopping done. After all, you wouldn’t attend Porchfest in high heels anyway, right? Sorry, but no golf carts! The entire foot print of the event is pedestrian friendly! If you want to experience Sanford’s Golf Cart lifestyle, just pick another weekend to rent a golf cart , or ride it outside the festival footprint on Porchfest Saturday. If you want you can of course also hitch a ride on one of the volunteer golf carts (in case you have to urgently get from A to B or are just too tired for the walk. Or even just to have some fun and experience the golf cart lifestyle that we Sanfordites are so proud of! Last but not least, if you have a chance to bring your bike, then by all means, do it! Downtown Sanford is one of the best places to ride your bike – just keep in mind that it WILL be busy (please no bumping into pedestrians!) and that you will need lights once it gets dark (Porchfest ends after 7pm) or you might have to push your bike later in the evening (again, no big deal, luckily everything is so close by!) Sanford Porchfest Map Use this map THIS MA P to get around and T HIS MAP to find out which band is playing at which porch at what time 😉 Eats & Drinks Many of the porches have food available for purchase but what’s better than ending your Porchfest Day with a good meal at one of our downtown restaurants? And then stay a little longer and enjoy a drink at one of our local breweries and bars. 2025 Sanford Porchfest Food and Drink Vendors New this year, but sold out… , so make a note for next year 😉 Photo Ops We know, this event is all about making and sharing memories. You will always be able to look at the the fun photos that will take you back to Sanford Porchfest 2025 😉 So go ahead and take advantage of one or all of the great photo opportunities sprinkled throughout the event.

OUR STORY Sanford Porchfest Corporation started in a dining room within the historic district on a hot summer day in June of 2017. Around the table sat four women – Nancy, Shana, Kim and Shelly – each determined to create an unforgettable experience for their city. After studying the originating festival in Ithaca, NY (curated in 2007), they decided Sanford was more than worthy of being included on the list of national Porchfest events . Putting pen to paper, ideas began to flow and Sanford Porchfest was born over a few glasses of homebrewed Pineapple Cider. ​ They refer to Sanford Porchfest as an event FOR the community, BY the community, tirelessly donating their time and attention to bringing Sanford Porchfest to life year after year. Each Producer has a full-time career and two are mothers to young children, oftentimes seen engaging with the community at the festival. ​ Since the launch of the inaugural festival (2018), Sanford Porchfest has taken flight. This grassroots event has been recognized by the readers of Orlando Weekly as the Best Music Festival (2021, 2022, 2023,2024) and MySanford Magazine as Best Charity / Music Festival (2021, 2022, 2023) as well as a Top Business in Sanford (2023). ​ While surrounding areas have tried to duplicate the magic of Sanford Porchfest, the Producers accredit their incomparable community for making Sanford Porchfest such a success. ​ The Board of Directors, aka the \"Producers\" (from left to right): Shelly Allen, Co-Founder, Vice President and Communications Officer Kim Waters, Co-Founder, President and Community Relations Officer Shana Gorondy, Co-Founder and Brand Management Officer Nancy Sepulveda, Co-Founder and Governance Officer ​ To contact the Producers, please email team@sanfordporchfest.org PORCHFEST THROUGH THE YEARS 2018 1ST ANNUAL 6 Porches / 30 Bands 600 Attendees / $1,000 Donated 2019 2ND ANNUAL 12 Porches /50 bands 1,200 Attendees / $7,000 Donated 2020 3RD ANNUAL 12 Porches / 50 Bands 2,500 Attendees / $15,000 Donated 2021 4TH ANNUAL 12 Porches / 50 Bands 5,000 Attendees / $21,000 Donated 2022 5TH ANNUAL 12 Porches / 50 Bands 15,000 Attendees / $35,000 Donated 2023 6TH ANNUAL 17 Porches / 70 Bands 20,000 Attendees / $52,500 Donated 2024 7TH ANNUAL 18 Porches / 74 Bands 35,000 Attendees / $70,000 Donated *Additional Funds: $1,500 in additional funds have been donated in support of needs outside of the arts (ie: Covid Relief, Artist Relief Fund). 02.22.25 DON'T MISS THE 8th ANNUAL SANFORD PORCHFEST! © 2017-2024 SANFORD PORCHFEST CORPORATION.
