I enrolled at New England Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, in Boston, now part of the University of Massachusetts, Boston.  After graduating, and passing my State Boards, I embarked on my forty-year career beginning as a freelance trade embalmer for several funeral homes. In 1981, I purchased an established funeral home in my hometown, and then in 1986 opened a branch in Andover, MA. I served on the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Funeral Directors Association for several years. I have been married to my favorite Radio City Rockette, Andrea, for 47 years; have five children and three grandchildren.  My two favorite sports are ice hockey and golf and I am lucky to have been able to play and excel in each. I played hockey in high school, college, and semi-pro leagues, then became a Certified High School & NCAA College Hockey Referee for eleven (11) years and a Varsity High School Hockey Coach in my home Town of Reading, MA for 15 years, during which time my team won several League, Division and State Championships!  What a thrill it was to play, referee and coach at Boston Garden (now TD Garden), home ice of the Boston Bruins! I have also always loved the sport of golf.  I am currently a member of Pelican Pointe Golf & Country Club in Venice, FL.. I have one hobby, Barbershop Quartet & Chorus singing which I did for over 50 yrs. I have been a member of several groups including Chorus of the Keys, Sarasota, FL and International competing chorus, THX of Sunrise, FL.  It was amazing to compete at the Rogers Center (now the Scotia Bank Center) in Toronto, Canada, home ice of the Toronto Maple Leaves, when we placed 7th in the International Championship in 2016. In 2002 I retired as CEO of Edgerley & Bessom Funerals Homes Inc. of Reading and Andover, MA and Andrea and I moved to Florida.   Retirement did not seem to suit me though and I decided to get a part time job:   first at Plantation Golf & Country Club, Venice, then as a bar tender at Sahib Shrine, Sarasota. Venice Theatre, recruited me to tend their bar twice a week. Which quickly led to my 14-year, full time job as Concession Stand Manager & bar tender. My Masonic background began March 2, 1983, when I was Raised to the Subline degree in Good Samaritan Lodge AF & AM, Reading, MA.  Among other offices I held I was elected as Master to serve in  2001-2002.  I was a member The Scottish Rite Bodies, Valley of Boston, Aleppo Shriners, Wilmington, MA, and Bektash Shriners Concord, NH. At Bektash, I was quite active as a member of their Aides Unit.  Upon moving to Venice, I joined Sahib Shrine and became a member of the Mariners Unit.  I have served as Fleet Captain, Vice Commodore and then Commodore in both 2010 and 2021.  I was honored to be appointed as Asst. Rabban in 2021, elected as Chief Rabban in 2021 and Potentate in 2022.  To be part of a great team hear at Sahib and Shriners International is the high point of my working life.  Because We Care, Paul F. Bekkenhuis, Potentate Larry M.
