Facebook Google Twitter Linkedin There was a time when marinas were mostly privately owned and operated entities where the CEO and head dockmaster were one in the same. Times have changed and with the business of a marina becoming more complex—housing more profit centers, following a greater number of regulations, and catering to the hospitality whims of today’s boaters–the operations have had to keep pace. Marina Jack Yacht Basin , formerly known for its restaurant Marina Jack’s, with slips being secondary, has completely revamped and now works as a public/private partnership that has been so successful Marina Dock Age awarded the facility the 2020 Business Operations Award. Marina Jack Yacht Basin occupies a key waterfront location in the City of Sarasota, Florida. The property on which the marina sits has always been owned by the City of Sarasota as a key spot on its waterfront. In 1965, a private operator was contracted to open and run Marina Jack Yacht Basin as a restaurant that catered to boating customers with designated day docks. The property remained as such until the early 2000’s when another private operator came on board and invested heavily in capital improvements to turn the restaurant into more of the marina it is today. Expanded floating docks, upland amenities, and more services that boaters seek were added and slowly the property started to become better known as a popular marina and not just a restaurant. In 2016, Suntex took over as the private operator working through a public/private partnership with the City of Sarasota. Since that time, Suntex has focused on taking the amenities to the next level adding new access control systems, reinvesting in slips to add boat lifts, and reconfiguring layouts to better meet the needs of today’s boater. A concierge service was added along with a boat club and boat rental operations, a brokerage, on-site retail spaces, moorings, and a laundry area. A big draw and highlight is the 24-hour fueling facility—the only one of its kind on the Gulf Coast. The development of annual SMART goals guides the health and success of Marina Jack Yacht Basin. Having options ranging from boatlifts to large slips to moorings has enabled the marina to capture a wide variety of boaters from jet-skis to megayachts. “We can accommodate the needs of all boaters from megayacht owners and crews to beginner boating families to sailors traveling the world,” said Kathryn Ross, general manager of Marina Jack Yacht Basin. Sign up for the Marina Dock Age newsletter. Our newsletter delivers the latest news straight to your inbox including breaking news, our exclusive content covering the marina and boatyard industry, new products, and much more. Your Email Email Address Subscribe With such a variety of boaters, it is challenging to accommodate all the service needs. Marina Jack Yacht Basin relies on a team of about eleven 3rd party contractors to cover anything a boater needs. The marina vets all new contractors so it can confidently provide those names to their boating customers. “We will give anyone who’s interested a try and if they will be an asset, we’ll sign them up to our team. It’s nice to have a team that primarily works out of this marina. They’re our first call if a customer needs something. It’s nice to have a good partnership in that way,” Ross said. The public/private operation enables the marina to share some of the operational expenses with the City and, in turn, the City receives a percentage of the gross profits, including a 50/50 split of the expenses and revenues for the moorings. “The City is the landlord and we represent them the best we can along with representing Suntex well as our corporate owner,” Ross said. A prime example of the public/private partnership is the pumpout boat, affectionately known as the “Brown Eyed Girl.” The city owns the boat and Marina Jack Yacht Basin stores and maintains it. With the City’s involvement the boat has been able to offer the pumpout service for free. The program has been revolutionary in eliminating waste from Sarasota Bay at a rate of 10,000 gallons of raw sewage properly disposed of each year. The 24-hour fueling facility is the only one of its kind on the Gulf Coast. Setting Operational Goals Suntex corporate offices work hard to ensure the marina meets daily, monthly, and seasonal goals and keeps close tabs on the operations. They work with the onsite management team to establish annual SMART goals to guide the health and success of the marina and all its revenue streams. To help managers better understand how the full-time employees approach problems and challenges, all management and staff take personality exams remitted by the corporate office. Ross says this helps to build a better understanding of how everyone operates best in their jobs. Looking ahead, the marina is planning to start retrofitting some of its older concrete docks into boatlifts, and alter the existing footprint of the marina to allow for slips that can accommodate a rising number of catamarans. “With the floating docks installed in the early 2000’s, we’re going to begin tweaking those because they are starting to need more maintenance to ensure the integrity of the docks,” Ross said. With a unique combination of slips, a wealth of amenities, and a loyal following, Marina Jack has become a true landmark for the City of Sarasota.

Photo credit: SUNTEX Going once, going twice….Marina Jack SOLD! December 1, 2016 in U.S. Gulf 0 695 SHARES 3.9k VIEWS Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share via Email Marina Jack in Sarasota, Florida, recognized as National Marina of the Year in 2015, has been sold to Suntex Marina Investors LLC. The Dallas-based investment firm did not disclose the sale price. The merger includes the 316-slip marina in downtown Sarasota, adjacent to Oleary’s Tiki Bar, as well as Bayfront Yacht Works & Marina, Bayfront Excursions and Turtle Beach Grill on south Siesta Key, Florida. “This is without question a merger of strengths from an operational and managerial standpoint,” says Robert L. Soran, CEO of Marina Jack. “We share a vision of future growth opportunities for our people and our combined companies.” Soran will have an equity interest and board advisory capacity with Suntex. Suntex now has a portfolio of 34 marinas in Kentucky, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and St. Maarten. With direct, no-bridge access to the Gulf of Mexico, Marina Jack’s marina operations have kept up facelifts and improvements at a pace that is matching the transformation of downtown Sarasota. The marina features slip accommodations for vessels up to 228 feet with 316 wet and dry slips, a full-service fuel dock, ship’s store, and an on-site Yacht Services department. Downtown Sarasota has become a trendy center for urban condo living and features many eclectic street-side dining venues for foodies, a Saturday morning farmers market, and an ever-changing collection of boutique shops that are favorites of cruisers. Marina Jack acquired the Turtle Beach Marina in September of 2015. Now known as Bayfront Yacht Works & Marina, this south Siesta Key business features a full-service boatyard with haul-out capabilities for vessels up to 65 feet. Bayfront Yacht Works & Marina adds an additional 60 dry and wet slips to the portfolio, along with a rapidly growing boat and watersport rental business known as Bayfront Excursions. The merger also includes three well-known restaurants, including the Marina Jack II —a 96-foot passenger vessel known for Sarasota’s preeminent sightseeing and sunset dinner cruises. Holiday Boat Parades While a few communities are struggling to rebuild docks and find enough money just to survive, let alone sponsor annual lighted boat parades, the show will go on in some of Florida’s Panhandle cities. • Carrabelle, December 10 th : The Boat Parade course starts at the Pavilion on Marine Street and proceeds up the Carrabelle River to the Tillie Miller Bridge. It can be enjoyed from anywhere along Marine Street and Highway 98. carrabelle.org • Destin, December 11 th : Judging of the 30 th Annual Harbor Lighted Boat Parade will start at 6PM upstairs at Harry T’s Restaurant. Boats will start lining up in the harbor between 5-5:30PM. Fireworks in the East Pass will light up the sky after the parade. • Cedar Key and Steinhatchee have both sustained significant dock damage, and at press time, were unsure whether the events normally scheduled for the first week of December would take place.

Sarasota, FL--- December 7, 2015 Marina Jack is honored to announce it has been selected as the 2015 National Marina of the Year by Marina Dock Age magazine, the marina industry’s leading publication. This highly competitive accolade is awarded to one small marina with under 250 slips, and one large marina with over 250 slips each year. Marina Jack was selected in the large marina category. This year’s Small Marina of the Year award went to Harbour Town Yacht Basin located on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. The winning marinas are selected by achieving success through exemplary business practices, contributions to the marina industry, commitment to customer service and environmental responsibility. Bob Soran – President, Marina Jack Sam Chavers – Director of Marina Operations, Marina Jack “This award is truly a testament to, not only our ownership, but our staff and customers,” said Sam Chavers, Director of Marina Operations at Marina Jack. “We’re honored and proud to represent the marina industry, the City of Sarasota, and our community with this nationally recognized distinction. Our business plan has always been to create points of difference for the customer in order to build one of the best marinas in the United States, and this award exemplifies our efforts towards that goal.” Marina Jack’s submission data highlighted it’s partnership between public and private sectors, strong ties in community events, highly experienced staff, industry involvement with boat shows and local brokerage affiliations, development of the City’s first mooring field, and it’s certification as a Clean Marina for the past 12 consecutive years. Marina Jack also highlighted their reinvestment within the marina, creating a hospitality-based marina center by providing first class amenities and services to a wide variety of customers. Marina Jack is one of only a few marinas on the West Coast of Florida with the capacity to accommodate luxury mega-yachts up to 228’ in length. Marina Dock Age Magazine is the only business-to-business publication serving the U.S. waterfront facilities segment of the marine industry. Marina Dock Age’s publication provides industry professionals, suppliers, and marketers with clear and practical advice, information, and education. “What struck me most about Marina Jack was how much it had changed over the last fifteen years or so, continuing to evolve when many marinas were struggling with the economy,” said Anna Townshend, editor of Marina Dock Age Magazine. “The marina invested a lot of money in its facilities, but it also listened to its customers and partnered with the City of Sarasota on important projects. The growth and success at Marina Jack over the last ten years is no surprise, when you read about all the marina has done to get there. The hard work is important, but each facility needs the right vision. Marina Jack is so tuned into its market and its possibilities, I’m sure the facility will only continue to grow.” Anna Townshend – Editor, Marina Dock Age Magazine Joe Catell – Yacht Services Manager, Marina Jack Sam Chavers – Director of Marina Operations, Marina Jack Kat Wilson – Associate Manager of Public Services/Marketing Director, Marina Jack Kim Eaton – SVP, Marinas.com Annie Wilson – Transient Manager/Retail Merchandiser, Marina Jack Marina Jack’s Owner Robert L.
