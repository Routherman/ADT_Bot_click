CEO Cara Lambright said the master plan will include areas above I-610, and will seek input from neighbors and at public meetings. By STEPHANIE RIEGEL | Staff writer Stephanie Riegel Author email Jun 27, 2023 Jun 27, 2023 5 min to read Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save After two decades of renovations, refurbishments and expansions, New Orleans' 170-year-old City Park, which for most of its history was a victim of meager public funding, has blossomed into a public treasure. The park's popularity with residents and visitors has soared, thanks to upgraded attractions like the Louisiana Children's Museum and improved care to its lawns and forests. A new citywide millage has offered some financial support, while its meandering bayous, centuries-old live oaks and natural spaces — a salve during the pandemic — are increasingly seen as solutions for broader environmental challenges.

(Photo by Chris Granger | The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate) STAFF PHOTO BY CHRIS GRANGER Now, park leaders say, the urban refuge needs a plan for its next 100 years. Officials with the newly created City Park Conservancy are embarking on a new master planning process aimed at guiding how the beloved, 1,300-acre park is utilized, and what role the it should play in New Orleans’ future. A $200 million plan New York-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburg Associates Inc. will lead the effort, which will take 18 months to complete and result in a laundry list of initiatives that could cost $200 million to implement over the next 20 years, City Park CEO Cara Lambright said.

According to the Friends of City Park website, it has 12 granite columns and topped with a bronze dome. Popp Bandstand was named for is benefactor, John F. Popp, and is a replica of the Temple of Love in Versailles. In 1916, Popp made a donation to the park to build the Popp Bandstand (located between the Peristyle and Cafe Du Monde), which was designed by architect Emile Weil. (Staff photo by David Grunfeld, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate) PHOTO BY DAVID GRUNFELD DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY A committee of park professionals unanimously selected the firm, known as MVVA, earlier this month from among five finalists. The two boards that govern and manage City Park both ratified the firm’s selection at meetings late Tuesday. The last time City Park completed a master plan was in 2005, just months before Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters devastated the region and the park with it. Having the plan in place made it easier to deploy the post-Katrina recovery money that followed, Lambright said, helping longtime City Park leader Bob Becker rally support behind projects and expansions that drew people back. But while that plan was effective, it was largely aimed at the portion of the park below Interstate 610. It also focused on individual projects, resulting in the addition of new features and popular attractions like the miniature golf course, tennis courts and the Great Lawn. New Orleans City Park CEO Cara Lambright on Thursday, January 14, 2021. PHOTO BY CHRIS GRANGER “We need a plan that will look at the park for the next 100 years,” said Lambright. “We have had a tendency to look at things one project at a time, which means we do things on an ad hoc basis. This will look at the park holistically, which we've never done before.” The new plan will focus on ways to utilize more of the acreage north of I-610, including City Park's two golf courses and the undeveloped Wisner Tract. It will also look towards enhancing the visitor experience, including making walking trails more easily accessible, adding and upgrading public restrooms, and increasing public safety. Perhaps most significantly, it will address the park’s role as a natural resource in an era of climate change — within a city that is prone to flooding. “Parks are meant to be resilient. They are meant to be a green sponge,” said Lambright. “We have never had a look at what City Park could do for us in that regard. We need to talk to our community about how we can create something beautiful that is also resilient.” An inventory of Live Oaks At more than 1,300 acres, City Park is larger than the cities of Gretna or Harahan and has a bigger footprint than New York’s Central Park. It is home to the world's largest collection of mature live oaks, some of them more than 800 years old. A Storyland whale is open for business on Sunday, March 5, 2023, at City Park.

But for all its assets, it was long hamstrung by a governance structure that made fundraising difficult. That all changed in 2022, when, the park's oversight board shifted day-to-day management of the park to a new private nonprofit organization, the City Park Conservancy. Once established, the conservancy's first order of business was to find a planning firm. Leaders wanted someone to think about the park in new ways while also collecting data and details that City Park officials have never had — like a complete inventory of the historic oaks. The natural low, spreading growth habit of the live oak makes it perfect for a tree swing. FILE PHOTO BY G. ANDREW BOYD “Here we are with one of the oldest collection of live oaks in the world and we do not have an arborist or a tree plan. We don’t have an inventory,” Lambright said. “They are our most valuable asset period and we have never looked at it them in this way.” Thirteen firms responded to a request for proposals. Five made the short list. “The caliber of all five was so incredible, we thought it would be impossible to pick one,” Lambright said. “But, it was unanimous.” 'A rare thing' MVVA, founded in 1982 by Michael Van Valkenburg, comes with impressive credentials. Among the projects and plans in its portfolio are Houston’s Hermann Park, New York City’s Brooklyn Bridge Park, the Gathering Place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the Harvard University campus. Mia Celestine, 12, and her cousin, Andrew Bergeron, 3, slide down at Storyland. STAFF PHOTO BY SCOTT THRELKELD MVVA officials said they were interested in the project because City Park, which attracts 16 million visitors a year, is a unique asset in a unique city. “It’s a rare thing when a very important park like this one wants to think about the next 100 years,” said MVVA Founding Principal Michael Van Valkenburgh. “Add to that that this park is in New Orleans — an extraordinary and wonderful city. It’s not something that happens every day.” MVVA’s plan will cost some $3.1 million, and is being paid for via a gift from the Greg Keller Foundation. The firm will split those fees with other consultants, specialists and subcontractors on its team.

(Photo by Chris Granger | The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate) PHOTO BY CHRIS GRANGER Public engagement will be part of the process. MVVA plans to convene at least six public meetings over the course of 18 months to ask residents what works well in the park, what could be better and what they’d like to see in the plan. “It’s not a linear process but a cycle of back and forth,” said MVVA senior associate Paloma Garcia. “We will listen to what people want and then come back with ideas and hear how people respond to them.” Philanthropic support Whatever MVVA comes up with will require major sources of new funding. It’s not clear where that money will come from, but the final report will include a market study and also a business plan to suggest ways of paying for the various projects. Lambright acknowledges it will take years or decades to make the plan a reality and that it will be paid for gradually, largely from private donations.

(Photo by Sophia Germer, NOLA.com , The Times-Picayune) STAFF PHOTO BY SOPHIA GERMER “We cannot do a $100 million-$200 million overhaul without philanthropy,” she said. Not everything contained in the plan will necessarily get done, even if it has support. Plans evolve over time and take on a life of their own, Van Valkenburgh said. \"It's interesting in the planning process to see what gets legs,\" he said. \"We don't do a master plan. We make a master plan in collaboration with the city and the people responsible for it day to day, and it changes over time. Parks are dynamic, living organisms that reflect changing tastes and lifestyles.\" Email Stephanie Riegel at stephanie.riegel@theadvocate.com .

The city of Anna Maria will host a grand-opening ceremony for the Mote Marine Laboratory educational outreach center on the city pier at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5, at City Pier Park, 103 N. Bay Blvd. The center will be housed in the 1,800-square-foot building on the pier’s T-end, the space originally planned to house a full-service restaurant. The center will feature interactive and live exhibits with about 1,000 gallons of recirculating seawater. The city extended Mote’s contract after a slow start on the project with new deadlines, which were all met after a 14-day extension was granted and Mote met the timeline. The ceremony to celebrate the center’s grand-opening will begin at City Pier Park and will be followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the landside entry to the pier. Mayor Dan Murphy has said he and Mote Marine president/CEO Dr. Michael Crosby would speak at the park ceremony, which he projected to last about 45 minutes. Several local officials have been invited to the public event, which will require the closure of sections of Pine Avenue and Bay Boulevard, according to Murphy. Attendees will have a chance to be among the first to step inside the completed center, which will open for daily operations following the ribbon-cutting.

Our programs — located in more than 350 parks, recreation centers, and public schools across New York City — reach 285,000 people each year. Our ethos is simple: thriving parks mean thriving communities. More than 30 Years of Bringing Parks to Life In 1989, Kramer vs. Kramer author Avery Corman was concerned about the state of the park near where he had grown up in the Bronx, so he began looking for ways to improve it. Thanks to Avery, and many other dedicated New Yorkers who took action at a critical time in our city’s history, City Parks Foundation now reaches 285,000 New Yorkers every year, offering programming to encourage residents to use and care for their local parks and green spaces. Over the years, we have grown to meet community needs, adding such notable programs as CityParks tennis — now the largest municipal tennis instruction program for kids in the country — and SummerStage — our city’s largest free outdoor performing arts festival. But we have not forgotten our roots, because we know that our city’s parks are always improved when New Yorkers get involved. Our city’s parks are the most fundamentally democratic of public spaces, available for anyone and everyone to use for recreation, for enjoyment, for relaxation, for community gathering, for environmental benefits, and for so much more. We are honored to partner with and serve New Yorkers of all ages — attending concerts together, learning yoga in our seniors fitness program, getting out on a rowboat with classmates to learn about our waterways, or volunteering to beautify a local playground — who are all focused on a singular goal: to bring these public spaces to life. Board & Staff Contact Us Press Room City Parks Foundation Programs Presenting World Class Performances in Your Neighborhood CityParks Shows brings hundreds of live music, dance and theater performances to communities throughout New York City’s five boroughs with Capital One City Parks Foundation SummerStage , the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre , and the traveling PuppetMobile . Learn More Keeping Kids & Seniors Active and Healthy Our sports programs transform New York’s parks into centers for recreation, providing free sports instruction, coaching and equipment to more than 12,000 kids, ages 6 to 17, and senior citizens in nearly 70 locations citywide.

Sit back, relax, enjoy the view and leave the driving and parking to someone else. Hop on and off as often as you like. Several trolleys loop the island from Coquina Beach on the southern tip in Bradenton Beach up to the City Pier in the City of Anna Maria on the northern end of the island on a daily basis. The trolleys also run on most holidays. Early birds will be excited to know island trolley service starts at 6am from both ends of the loop. Trolleys typically run at 20 minute intervals until 9pm, then every 30 minutes until 10:30pm. (times may vary due to unforeseen incidents, traffic conditions or weather) You’ll never be far from a trolley stop, you can usually find them every two to four blocks. With 35 northbound and 35 southbound trolley stops, it’s easy to get anywhere you want to go on the island. For a list of all the trolley stops, route and time table, pick up an AMI Chamber of Commerce island map at the Chamber office, the visitor kiosk at Manatee Beach or at various businesses around the island. You may also find a schedule on the MCAT site here. The front of the trolley holds two single seat, two-wheeled bikes 16 inches or higher. It is easy to load your bikes on the rack, then unload them at any trolley stop and go exploring on your own. Be sure to take all your belongings when you get off the trolley. Should you leave something on the trolley, please contact MCAT lost and found at 941-747-8621. We invite you to enjoy the free island air-conditioned trolley. Not only is it fun, but you will be helping reduce traffic and congestion on the island. Please read about our Trolley Giving Back Program to learn more about how it contributes to keeping the trolley free as well as giving back to the local community. If you find it in your heart to help, donations are gratefully appreciated. There are donation boxes on each of the trolleys. Beach ConneXion Shuttle The newest trolley, the Beach ConneXion Shuttle , runs seasonally from December through April every year. This new service began December 2019 to help drivers avoid heavy beach traffic on Manatee Avenue going on and off Anna Maria Island during peak tourist season. The Beach ConneXion Shuttle will operate on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, from 10am to 6pm. As are all the trolleys on the Island, The Beach ConneXion Shuttle is also free! Pick up the shuttle at the sheltered Manatee County Area Transit bus stop at the northeast corner of Manatee Avenue and 75th Street West. There is plenty of parking in the commercial center there (Kmart/Publix center). No need to try and find a parking space on the Island, the shuttle will take you right to Manatee Public Beach! There are also several bus stops between Manatee Avenue/75th Street West and Manatee County Public Beach where passengers can get on or off the Shuttle at any of these stops as well. Mainland transit connections to the new Beach ConneXion Shuttle are available via MCAT Route 3 which serves the Manatee Avenue corridor and operates Monday through Saturday, and the Beach Express operating along the same corridor on Sundays and holidays. Prefer to relax at Coquina Beach on the south end of the island? Board the Beach ConneXion Shuttle , travel to AMI, and make a connection to the southbound AMI Trolley at Manatee County Public Beach.  The AMI Trolley, which operates every 20 minutes (depending on traffic conditions), will take you to the main entrance by the beach café at Coquina Beach. Be sure to download the trolley app to track the trolley’s whereabouts and its expected arrival or departure time for your stop. Trolley App Want to know where the trolley is in real time, how long it will be before it gets to your stop, or where the nearest trolley stop is? You can now find the trolley (or any other Manatee County Area Transit Bus) on your phone! Download the myStop software application on your mobile device. The myStop app can be accessed using the Apple Store or Google Play Store . Select Manatee County as the transit authority, and identify your trolley/bus route and stop in the app. You can set up optional notifications for trolley arrivals at your designated stop. Once your preferences are set to the AMI Trolley Route, a map of the whole island with all the trolley stops and icons showing the current trolley locations will be displayed. It’s that easy! Make the most of your time on the island and plan your day using the app to receive real-time trolley information as travel conditions vary day to day, especially during peak tourist season when island traffic is heavier. You can also track the trolley from any trolley stop without the app if you have a QR code reader on your phone. Scan the QR code at a particular stop and it will provide the arrival time for each trolley servicing that specific stop. For non-techie folks, you can call MCAT at 941-749-7116 during their regular business hours, 7AM to 6PM, Monday through Friday, for real-time information on the trolley.

Islander Photo: ChrisAnn Allen “It won’t be too much longer,” Anna Maria Mayor Dan Murphy said March 11 of opening the new Anna Maria City Pier during a meeting of the Coalition of Barrier Island Elected Officials in Holmes Beach. And the community is ready for a celebration. Led by Anna Maria Commissioner Carol Carter, residents of AMI municipalities gathered March 9 at Anna Maria City Hall, 10005 Gulf Drive, for a meeting of the Love AMI Task Force. The group is planning an “unofficial” celebration for May 30 under the shade sails at the City Pier Park — on the corner of Pine Avenue and North Bay Boulevard in Anna Maria — to celebrate the new pier. The original pier opened in 1911, but was closed after it was damaged by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The old pier was demolished and the city began construction on a new pier in 2018. Murphy told The Islander March 11 that Florida Power and Light workers installed the transformers and a pole required for electrical service. Since that work is done, contractor Mason Martin of Holmes Beach can finish work on buildings at the T-end that will eventually house a restaurant, bathrooms and bait shop. The mayor also said the area at the pier entrance was fenced off March 13 while excavation and connections are made for utilities. A grand opening date has not yet been set but Murphy said the matter would be addressed at the city commission meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday, March 26, at city hall. The city had hoped to open the pier in late March or April, but that could be impacted by COVID-19. Meanwhile, Love AMI is planning to host “Pier Party 2020,” unless that is delayed by COVID-19. A draft mission statement declares the group’s intent is “to promote a sense of community across Anna Maria Island that attracts and maintains residents,” and “to develop sponsor and/or host events that engage AMI residents, fosters community connections and promotes a sense of pride for AMI.” Party plans include live music, a video on the history of the pier, children’s activities and a champagne toast at sunset.

Shore Drive, Anna Maria. Islander Photo: Ryan Paice Anna Maria resident John Kolojeski speaks at an Oct. 19 city commission meeting to support changes to city code that would allow dogs to be walked on a leash in City Pier Park, as well as the addition of a potential dog park within city limits. People soon may be allowed to walk their canine friends at City Pier Park in Anna Maria. City commissioners Oct. 19 directed staff to draft potential code changes to allow people to walk leashed pets at City Pier Park, 101 N. Bay Blvd., as recommended by the planning and zoning board. P&Z member Dusty Crane, wife of Commissioner Jonathan Crane, attended the meeting on behalf of the board to request the city amend Section 38-28, which prohibits dogs and other domestic animals in city parks and certain public spaces. Dusty Crane said the code should be changed to allow dogs to be walked by leash in City Pier Park, excluding the playground, and recommended the addition of a waste station. “Many residents and visitors were not aware of the code’s prohibition of dogs in the park until new signage was installed,” she said. “This amendment would go a long way to improving both residents’ and visitors’ enjoyment of City Pier Park.” The amendment would only apply to City Pier Park, since Bayfront Park, 316 N. Bay Blvd., is operated by Manatee County. The amendment also would not allow owners to walk their pets on the beach, where domestic animals are prohibited. Mayor Dan Murphy asked if the P&Z’s proposed changes would allow dogs in the park during events. Dusty Crane said details like that could be left to the commission. Commissioner Robert Kingan said the city may establish a dog park to keep things simple. Murphy said the city had a few pocket parks that could be used for that purpose. Commissioner Charlie Salem said he was in support of establishing a dog park but also wanted to encourage people to use City Pier Park as much as possible by allowing them to bring their pets. During public comment, resident John Kolojeski supported allowances for dogs in parks, as well as a potential dog park within city limits. He said dog-owning residents like himself have to travel down to the Holmes Beach city field to visit a dog park, so adding one within the city would be “wonderfully convenient.” Murphy said he would bring drafted code changes back for discussion ahead of a first reading to gather as much public feedback as possible. “I don’t think this is something we should do in a vacuum. There’s a lot of people that are totally opposed to this, and we need to hear from them.… We’ve only heard from one side,” he said. The commission will meet next at 6 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 16, at city hall. Directions to attend via Zoom can be found on the city’s website, cityofannamaria.com.

She came to the island from Tampa, FL where she worked for the Embassy Suites in Downtown Tampa since 2007. She fell in love with the coffee shop business and opened a coffee shop with her then mother-in-law, MJ, when she was married to MJ’s stepson who was in the Air Force. Bev has always enjoyed helping others. While being a military dependent she volunteered for the Officer’s Wives Club and did many things for the military community and the families of these communities. She served on the Board in various positions and enjoyed her time helping others. When MJ asked if she would like to open a coffee shop on Anna Maria Island back in 2010, she worked diligently through 2011 until she found the perfect spot for their coffee shop. She immediately went to the Chamber of Commerce to join because she felt that would help her become a part of the community. She and MJ started volunteering by helping the Chamber with Bayfest, prior to their opening Island Coffee Haus in Nov, 2012. She continues to volunteer for the festivals as she enjoys the interaction with the members of the Chamber and the communities on the island. After becoming a resident of the island in 2012, Bev continues to enjoy all the permanent and transient residents on the island. Her coffee shop has become a meeting place for people to come and enjoy. She has found her paradise.

Diane Phinney Diane Phinney moved here in 2010 from Massachusetts after renting for two seasons and agreeing with her husband that the people living on AMI were the friendliest people out of all the 19 states in which they had previously lived. A graduate with a BS from The State University of NY at Potsdam and a MA from Michigan State, Diane worked primarily in Social Work, Education and Non-Profit Administration. Her desire to help others was fulfilled with work in adoption, foster care, community education, battered women and troubled and at-risk youth. Community volunteerism has always been a passion. On AMI she has served as President of the Key Royale Homeowner’s Association, Secretary of Cultural Connections and PR Chair of Island Players. In addition, she has provided leadership to committees at The Center, The Tour of Homes, artsHOP and Food & Wine on Pine. Working and playing in the out-of-doors is one of Diane’s loves. With a friend, she started a kayaking group soon after moving here. In season, you might see a group of 15-20 people kayaking in Bimini Bay or paddling around Key Royale…. these would be the “Yakkers”. They understand, as Diane does, how the feeling of paddling these waters and observing nature all around them can be transforming. She encourages others to come experience all the island offers and to make Anna Maria their home. Mike Southwick Mike attended AMI Elementary, played football at the youth center, recalls the private airstrip where Holmes Beach City Hall resides and the lack of paved roads.

His professional background includes 10 years in the real estate industry followed by 20 years in the PEO industry. Mike supports local charities such as Wildlife, Inc., Manatee Children’s Services and the Navy Seal Foundation. Mike’s support of our military is due in part to his father, Captain C.E. Southwick who was a highly decorated Naval Aviator and former POW during the Vietnam War. Mike resides in Bradenton Beach with his wife Sheryl. They love boating, cooking, gardening, local and Alaska fishing trips. Wende Webb Wende Webb is the owner of a small business, Gulf Coast Property Watch.
