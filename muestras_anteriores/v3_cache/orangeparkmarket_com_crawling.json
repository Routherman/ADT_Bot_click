Amber Operations Director Read Amber's Bio Expand Amber (she/her) was born and raised in the Willamette Valley and loves what this part of the world has to offer for food and play. She began working with Portland Farmers Market in 2007 while attending graduate school at Portland State University, earning a Master’s in Public Administration in 2009. In addition to her passion for well curated markets and rain gear, Amber is particularly proud of PFM’s progress in reducing waste and creating inclusive community gathering spaces for Portland residents and visitors. Eamon Accounting & Office Manager Read Eamon's Bio Expand Eamon (he/him) was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island. After moving to Rochester, NY for college, he spent 18 years there, immersing himself in food justice and local agriculture through work in restaurants, food cooperatives, and regional food networks. In 1995, Eamon and his family moved to Portland, Oregon, where he became deeply involved in the city's local food community. From 2004 to 2022, he served as the Market Manager at the Hillsdale Farmers Market, playing a key role in supporting local farmers and fostering community connections. Eamon briefly took on the role of General Manager at Food Front Cooperative in 2016 and 2017. After nearly two decades of operational market management, he transitioned to an office-based position, continuing his work in food access and sustainability. Eliza Accounting & Administrative Assistant Read Eliza's Bio Expand Eliza (she/her) was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she also received her Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics from Universidade Federal Fluminense. Eliza moved to the US in 2010 to work as a bookkeeper for a non-profit publishing company. Attracted by the fantastic food this city offers, she moved to Portland in March 2024. Now, she works as an Accounting and Administrative Assistant, and her main reason for joining Portland Farmers Market is to be part of its wonderful community. Eliza loves to cook new recipes and hang out with her partner, Ben, and her cat, Morris. Helena Community Engagement Manager Read Helena's Bio Expand Through her hometown of Chicago and large family, Helena (she/they) fostered a love of food and how it connect us as humans and neighbors. While studying international relations and economics in Minneapolis, she started a food pantry at her college after seeing how much of the community was struggling with access. Since then, she’s lived and learned in Namibia, D.C., Denver, Hawaii, and Eugene working in various facets of the food system. Her experience in sustainable agriculture, food justice, grassroots organizing, and nutrition education has shown the many ways that we can dream up a more holistic and joyful food system. Helena is inspired by democratic workplaces and collective management structures, and believes that when power is shared the best decisions are made. Nowhere has felt more at home than Oregon, and Helena’s excited to be part of an organization that connects us to food and each other. When not in the office, you can find her crafting, cooking, frolicking with her chihuahua, and binge-watching trash TV. Jacquelyn Market Manager, Programs & Volunteers Read Jacquelyn's Bio Expand Jacquelyn (she/her) grew up in the Willamette Valley and has always had a deep appreciation for connecting with and honoring the land. She is a food justice advocate and is passionate about sustainable and equitable food systems and believes that everyone should have access to culturally appropriate and locally grown nutritious foods. Jacquelyn began working with the Portland Farmers Market in 2024 and brings with her experience working in local food banks and pantries, mental healthcare, and education. She graduated from Portland State University in 2023 with a Master’s in Leadership for Sustainability Education and is excited to join the Portland Farmers Market team and contribute to thriving local food systems. When Jacquelyn is not working she enjoys spending time outside and connecting with the seasons, birding watching, forest bathing, cuddles with her dogs and cat, and rewatching her favorite childhood show the X-Files. Katy Executive Director Read Katy's Bio Expand Katy (she/her) is a seasoned nonprofit executive with a passion for sustainable agriculture, equitable food access, and environmental justice. To Portland Farmers Market she brings fourteen years of director-level experience in nonprofit management, a depth of knowledge around local food systems, and a strong background in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion within organizations and beyond. Katy is the founder of Portland Fruit Tree Project, where she served as executive director for 10 years. Most recently, she was executive director for Families for Climate, and Interim Executive Director for 350PDX. In addition, Katy has a background in community engagement, program development, agriculture, and advocacy through past work with Growing Gardens, Cully Farmers Market, WSU Extension, and the Portland/Multnomah Food Policy Council. Her work has earned her numerous awards, including the Skidmore Prize from Willamette Week and the Innovators award from 1000 Friends of Oregon. Katy was born and raised in Baltimore, and has lived in Portland for over two decades. When not working she enjoys spending time with her kids, and finds particular joy in gardening, biking, and exploring natural areas together. Sarah Market Manager, Communications & At-Market Presence Read Sarah's Bio Expand Sarah (she/her) is a native Texan that at eighteen fled to the east coast as she was desperate for genuine seasons. After earning her degree in Psychology from Brandeis University and working in Higher Education Administration, she decided to shift gears in order to fully embrace her true passion of food. This shift brought her to Portland in 2015 to attend Oregon Culinary Institute where she earned a degree in Baking and Pastry Arts and Restaurant Management. While baking professionally in Portland, she continued her education at Portland State University earning a graduate certificate in Sustainable Food Systems. Sarah is thrilled to be a part of the Portland Farmers Market team in their mission of growing an equitable, healthy, and sustainable local food system. When not excelling at spreadsheets, Sarah enjoys cooking with and for loved ones, exploring the natural wonders of the PNW and staring lovingly at other people’s dogs. Stephanie Communications & Marketing Manager Read Stephanie's Bio Expand Stephanie (she/her) brings her passion for local food & community and numerous years of marketing experience to her role at Portland Farmers Market. Calling Portland home for over 20 years, Stephanie grew up in coastal San Diego, where she enjoyed an overabundance of locally grown avocados & citrus and learned an appreciation for all the ocean has to offer. She attended Humboldt State University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and experienced a farmers market for the first time. This sparked a lifelong interest in good, clean, and fair food for all. When she is not at the farmers markets, Stephanie loves exploring the Pacific Northwest with her dog, drinking hoppy IPAs, and dabbling in the domestic sciences (cooking, baking, fermenting, preserving, knitting, sewing, painting watercolors, and weaving). Board PFM is governed by a volunteer-run board composed of community leaders, farmers market vendors, professionals and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds.
