We are always looking for volunteers to help with the organization and execution of the Frog Leg Festival.  If you are interested in volunteering your time and talents please fill out the form below and our Volunteer Coordinator will contact you.

I’m Stephanie Nace, the proud founder of Frogleg Studio, which I started way back in 2001. I’ve always been a bit “extra” when it comes to details, originality, and pouring my heart into my work. With over two decades as a design educator and even longer as a creative professional, I absolutely love teaming up with students and clients to bring fresh, exciting ideas to life. Then, in 2022, Paul joined both my life and the studio—and let me tell you, he’s “extra,” too! With his background in electrical engineering, he’s a stickler for precision, craftsmanship, and making sure everything in the studio runs like clockwork. Together, we’ve found the perfect mix of craftsmanship, typography, and illustration, which shines through in our letterpress work. Everything we design is one-of-a-kind and created just for you. Once it leaves our studio, it’s never repeated. It’s all about capturing your personality, quirks, and style. At Frogleg Studio, we offer custom graphic design, letterpress, foil printing, risograph printing, die cuts, and debossing. Got an idea? We’ll bring it to life! We’re all about creating one-of-a-kind designs that fit you —and your budget (because stunning shouldn’t mean scary expensive). Wedding investments start around $6K, but the sky’s the limit depending on how fancy you want to get. No cookie-cutter designs here—every piece is custom-made just for you, never to be repeated. And don’t worry, you have our full, undivided attention—no distractions (except maybe for tea breaks). Plus, we print everything in-house on one of our four presses, which helps keep costs reasonable—because who doesn’t love a little luxury without the sticker shock? Let’s make something unforgettable! Here's how the magic happens! Once we get your inquiry form, we’ll set up a Blue Skies Meeting. This is where you share all the juicy details about your big day—your dreams, ideas, and visions for the ceremony and reception. We want to hear all about your style, your love story, the little moments that make your relationship unique. How did you meet? What was your first date like? The more details, the better! This info helps us create a wedding suite that’s as one-of-a-kind as you are. After our meeting and the $500 proposal fee, I’ll provide a custom quote and mood board, giving you a preview of your wedding suite’s vibe. This also ensures your date is officially locked in on our creative calendar Once you fall head over heels for your custom mood board, sign the contract and pay the 50% retainer—then the fun really begins! We’ll dive into creating your personalized color palette, custom illustrations, letterpress designs, and all the day-of materials. You’ll be involved every step of the way, from the sketches to the final proofs, ensuring everything feels just right. Finally, it’s time to bring your vision to life! A team of talented artisans, from papermakers to vintage stamp curators to ink mixers, will work their magic, ensuring your design comes together flawlessly. The end result? A stunning wedding suite that tells your story in the most beautiful way possible. Let’s Talk We are looking forward to collabrating.
