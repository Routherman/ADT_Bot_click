Notwithstanding anything in these Rules and Regulations to the contrary, all guests, residents, visitors and other occupants (collectively, \"guests\") are required to comply with all rules and regulations posted at the property, as well as all directions of the resort management and team. We reserve the right to remove from the resort anyone in violation of these Rules and Regulations, or any rules or regulations posted at the resort. There are no refunds for voluntary departure, eviction, acts of nature or removal in accordance with these Rules and Regulations or by law enforcement or court order. In the event, in connection with your stay, you are required to sign a reservation agreement, lease, RV placement agreement or any other document, and the terms of such document directly conflict with these Rules and Regulations, the terms of that document shall control. These Rules and Regulations are subject to change at any time without notice. RESERVATION PAYMENT POLICY Reservations of 3 nights or less require a deposit of 100% of the total reservation amount. Reservations of 4 nights or more require a 50% deposit of the total reservation. All reservations for 30 nights or longer require a deposit of $500. Deposits are refundable only in accordance with the Cancellation Policy below. The full balance of the reservation will be due and payable upon arrival. A valid credit card is required to be on file for all reservations, which Sun Outdoors has the right to charge for any unpaid amounts owed by the guest, or for such other amounts that are the responsibility of the guest (including, without limitation, property damage caused by a guest), in accordance with applicable law. Personal checks are not accepted at check-in. RESORT FEES, OTHER FEES & TAXES Certain properties charge a daily resort fee, which is added to each reservation for certain amenities made available to guests. These amenities vary by property, but may include Wi-Fi internet, basic cable (where applicable), various activities, access to onsite facilities and more. Sun does not guarantee that amenities will be available to guests at all times, as certain amenities are subject to seasonal closures, closure for repair, maintenance, or other purposes, or may not have capacity to accommodate all guests at the desired time of use. For a more detailed description of available amenities, please visit each individual property website. In addition, there may be additional fees (e.g. site lock fees) and taxes applicable to your stay. Any fees and taxes applicable to your reservation will be clearly identified in advance of your booking during the booking process, and in the confirmation email you receive upon completion of your booking. CANCELLATION POLICY Nightly/Weekly Stays: For all guests with stays shorter than 30 nights (\"short-term guests\") (i) cancellations may be made for a full refund of your deposit up to the date that is 14 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, (ii) cancellations made after the date that is 14 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, but prior to arrival, will be subject to a cancellation fee equal to all required deposits previously paid, and (iii) no refunds will be given for any cancellation following your check-in date.

Any guests that have not shown up 24 hours after their check-in time, and have not made prior arrangements with the resort staff, will be considered a no-show reservation and forfeit their deposit. GUEST ARRIVAL & DEPARTURE INFORMATION FOR SEASONAL GUESTS Guests staying for the duration of the season at a seasonally operated resort, where their RV may remain on the property year round, may arrive any time after 9:00 am on opening day for the resort's season and must vacate the resort no later than 5:00pm on closing day for the resort's season. Seasonal guests are required to check-in and check-out with the welcome center on the initial date of arrival and last date of departure for the season. Payment in full for any outstanding balance owed by the guest is due prior to initial check-in for the season. SITE LOCATIONS & TENT ACCOMMODATIONS All site numbers are subject to change prior to arrival unless a site lock fee was paid with your reservation. Only certified RV types are permitted unless prevented by specific site constraints, this includes Class A, B, and C Motorhomes, 5th wheels, and travel trailers. We reserve the right to inspect any personal property that you bring into the resort, and we may refuse access if your property is not properly constructed, is unsafe, or is unsuitable for the resort. Tents, pop up campers, and conversion vans are only permitted on designated sites. Sites are designed to accommodate one unit at a time. Only one \"pup\" tent may act as a secondary unit on a site at the discretion of Sun Outdoors as site size allows, and must be taken down during the day. One dining canopy tent is permitted, but may not be up in conjunction with a \"pup\" tent, and must be properly secured at all times. Sites must be cleaned up of garbage and debris prior to departure. Additional charges may result for sites requiring additional cleaning. PERMITTED OCCUPANTS All reservations include a maximum of 6 guests unless otherwise stated. Rates are based on the maximum occupancy of the site. For all-age resorts, the individual reserving the site must be a minimum of 18 years of age and be physically present at the time of check-in. Children 14 and under must be supervised by an adult 18 year of age or over at all times. VISITORS Guests may have visitors (individuals not registered on the reservation or agreement) visit them, so long as such visitors do not cause the guest to exceed the maximum permitted occupancy listed above. Visitors must register at the welcome center and are subject to any applicable guest fees. For short-term guests, the daily visitor fee is $15 per person, or a non-transferrable seasonal visitor pass may be purchased for $150 per person, where applicable. At annual resorts in Arizona and Florida, there will be no charge for the first 14 days a visitor stays with a guest; however, beginning on the 15th day of a visitor's stay, there will be an additional charge of $15 per day per visitor, payable in advance. Visitors are required to abide by all Resort Rules and Regulations. Guests are responsible for the behavior of their visitors. Visitors are only permitted to be on property when resort guests are present. It is the responsibility of the guests to come into the welcome center to register all visitors. PHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO CONSENT As part of Sun Outdoors' marketing and other efforts we may sometimes take pictures, video or audio recordings of the resort and our guests and visitors. In choosing to stay at one of our resorts, each guest and visitor present on the property hereby consents to our capture and use of voice recordings, images, videos, and likeness for any marketing or other purposes not prohibited by law, indefinitely, and without payment of any royalty, licensing or other fees whatsoever. If any minor children are present, their legal guardian is required to let the manager know at the time a photo or video is taken that permission is not given to use their likeness for any marketing purposes. AMENITIES & FACILITIES We encourage you to visit the individual property website for specific information and dates relating to on-site amenity closures and other property specific information. Please remember that many amenities are on a seasonal and weather dependent schedule that may have limited hours during the off-season. We reserve the right to close any facilities at our discretion without prior notice, and without refund of any fees or other amounts paid for the reservation. Please refer to posted rules and regulations throughout the property for additional information on our amenities. All amenities are use at your own risk. Swimming and boating may only occur in designated areas where these amenities are offered. Specific locations require guests to display their property-issued wristband or photo name badge at all times while on site, as well as for access to amenities. All persons must wear dry shirt, pants and shoes when entering the Welcome Center or any facility building. CAR PASSES & GATE CARDS Two vehicles, inclusive of one RV (other than for vacation rentals), are included with each reservation or agreement as determined by Sun Outdoors and as space allows. Additional vehicles for registered guests are $15 per day or, where offered, $150 for an annual pass, and subject to availability of parking in designated areas. Car passes are issued to registered guests listed on the reservation or agreement only and must be visible at all times. Car passes are not transferrable and may not be shared with another guest or visitor. All guests' vehicles must be parked on their designated site and may not stick out into the road. If parking is limited or not available on a particular site, then vehicles must be parked in one of the resort's designated parking areas, if available. Under no circumstances are guests permitted to occupy sites not included in their reservation, even if not otherwise occupied. Unregistered vehicles found without a pass may be towed at the owner's expense. Car covers and wheel covers are permitted if factory made and in acceptable appearance and in good condition. Car covers must be properly secured to the vehicle, weights to hold the cover down are not allowed. Any lost or unreturned gate cards will result in a $25 replacement fee. Gate access cards are only applicable at specific locations; not all locations are gated, or require a gate card. QUIET HOURS Our quiet hours are from 11pm - 8am daily, unless otherwise dictated by on-site staff or local regulations. Please be courteous to your fellow guests during all hours of the day. During quiet hours, no loud talking, loud radios, loud televisions or other loud noises or behavior that may disturb guests is permitted. The use of generators are not permitted on the property, unless prior approval from management is granted. RESPECT YOUR NEIGHBOR Please be considerate of your neighbors' privacy and space. Do not walk on or pass through the site of another guest. Respect our local culture, wildlife, and those around you. Please be mindful of our local bylaws and conservation of resources. We are proud to promote an inclusive and family friendly atmosphere at all our resorts. Harassment or offensive or intolerant language or actions will not be tolerated in any form, included with respect to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or political views. Flags, signs or other visual symbols that contain vulgarity, depict the Confederate flag, or represent politicians or political candidates are not permitted to be displayed. We reserve the right to immediately evict any guest, without refund, for failure to comply with these rules and/or staff's request for you to remove the display of offensive visuals or symbols. LOCAL WILDLIFE Please respect our local wildlife. Use caution when near bodies of water or natural brush, as some of the local wildlife is dangerous and should be left alone. Some of the local wildlife is protected by State Law. Feeding, killing, abusing or otherwise disturbing the wildlife is strictly prohibited. Additionally, feeding stray animals, including but not limited to cats or birds is prohibited. SMOKING & ALCOHOL There is no smoking, including vaping, allowed in vacation or cottage rentals, resort restrooms and shower facilities, indoor facilities, common areas, or any outdoor amenities. Smoking is allowed on your own site as long as it is done so in a way that will not directly or indirectly impact the experience of other guests. Alcohol is permitted by legal drinking age adults as long as it is done so in a way that will not directly or indirectly impact the experience of other guests. Alcohol must be consumed in a responsible manner, and may be restricted in certain areas of the resort. Illegal drugs are strictly prohibited. Any guests or visitors that are smoking or using alcohol in an irresponsible manner, or in a manner that interferes with another guest's enjoyment will be asked to stop and may be asked to leave or removed for failure to comply. SITE SAFETY Each site is generally provided one table, as well as one fire pit if allowed by local regulations. Please do not burn or leave trash in fire pits, and do not move pits without permission from the staff. All fires must be contained to the pit/ring, and are permitted only from 8am -Midnight. Never leave a fire unattended. County bans may occur and will be posted at the welcome center. Any chemicals or toxic materials must remain locked up at all times, or safely removed from the access of children or animals. DANGEROUS CONDITIONS While it is always our priority to allow guests the peaceful and undisturbed enjoyment of their site, in the event a resort team member believes, in their reasonable discretion, that an emergency or dangerous condition exists on a guest's site, which could potentially pose a risk of harm to any person or property, the resort team has the right to enter the guest's site and access any area or unit on the site, in order to remedy the emergency or dangerous condition, or prevent or mitigate the potential harm. PETS We are a pet-friendly resort but pets may not disturb other guests, and must be cleaned up after by owners. Pets must always be on a leash and restrained when not confined inside an RV, and no pet may be left unattended outside of an RV, even on the site or if restrained. There is a maximum of two pets per reservation with a $100 non-refundable fee per reservation for any pet in a vacation or cottage rental. Pets are the responsibility of the owner. If management determines that a pet is disruptive or aggressive, they have sole discretion to require the guest to restrict the pet's behavior or location, or remove the pet from the resort. If a guest is unwilling or unable to restrict the pet or have it removed from the resort, as requested by management, management has the right to immediately terminate the guest's reservation and evict the guest from the resort, without refund. All pets must also be up to date on vaccines, and copies of pet vaccine records must be available upon request. Upon check-in, you are required to notify the office of your pets if you have not already added them to your reservation during the booking process. GARBAGE & RECYCLING Any household garbage and recycling are to be put in the designated areas, garbage bins and recycling receptacles located on the resort map. Select resorts may offer garbage pickup services. Disposal of hazardous waste or large items such as mattresses, couches, or chairs, is not permitted on property and should be taken to a local dump facility. Additional charges may result for unapproved disposal of items. SEWER HOOKUP All sewer hoses must be undamaged, and sewer connections must be tight with a sewer donut around the sewer hose at the point of connection to the sewer pipe. Sewer hoses must be sloped downward from the RV's sewer connection to the resort sewer hookup to prevent any clogging or spillage on the ground. Any damaged or leaking hose must be repaired immediately. Guests are responsible, and will be charged, for any damages caused by the guest's sewer hookup. ELECTRICITY Site electric pedestals are owned by the resort - any guest found tampering with electrical pedestals will be removed from the resort without any refund. Guests should not be overloading electric pedestals and should be utilizing code-compliant, approved outdoor extension cords. Connecting electric to washers and dryers inside private sheds is not permitted. Please help conserve electricity, turn off all non-essential lights (inside and outside), A/C, and heaters when not in use. Dusk-to-Dawn lights must be turned off between stays. Electric vehicles are only permitted to be charged in designated locations. UTILITY BILLS For resorts that rebill utilities, all guests are expected to pay balances due in a timely manner. Any utility bills that are not paid on time are subject to shut off based on local regulations. WASTE WATER The discharge of any wastewater (septic or grey water) or any other toxic or hazardous material is strictly prohibited. Formaldehyde products or any other tank cleaning chemicals are not permitted. MAIL & PACKAGES At select resorts, locked postal boxes are available for long-term guests. Additional fees may apply for this service. For resorts without full service mail offerings, we cannot guarantee you will receive your mail if it is sent directly to the resort. While staying on property at these resorts, we suggest that you rent a PO Box at the local post office. Seasonally operated resorts have no method of sorting and delivering mail. Packages being delivered to year-round resorts must be delivered directly to your site. Seasonally operated resorts will accept packages at the welcome center on an emergency basis. The resort is not responsible for lost or stolen packages/mail. SPEED LIMIT Guests must obey posted speed limits on property at all times. Failure to obey speed limits may result in removal from the property without refund. TRANSPORTATION Non-motorized skateboards, scooters, roller blades, roller skates and bicycles are permitted to be utilized as long as they are done so in a safe and quiet manner. Operation of motorized micro mobility devices is allowed for those over 16 years of age with a valid driver's license. Motorized items such as drones, motorbikes, hover boards and similar motorized recreational items are prohibited.
