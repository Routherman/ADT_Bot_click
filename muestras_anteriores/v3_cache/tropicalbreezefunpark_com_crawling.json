The water features and the little signs and of course the drinks, the other customers, and the workers were just amazing! The music was really great too. We had so much fun. We'll definitely be back again! Coleen Wybranski Designation We chose this as an alternative to Topgolf, and are so glad that we did — it was a miles better alternative for our young family. The staff was super sweet and attentive, and nowhere else will you find such a prompt on-course delivery service! The next time we’re in Florida we’re definitely going to make this a destination. Tiffany Rollman Designation This was hands down the best maintained course my kids and I have ever been on. The kids loved the different challenges on each hole and the electronic score card was an awesome addition. It is clear that the staff care about the upkeep, because the course is in pristine condition and they do a stunning job with the landscaping. We definitely plan to come back when we travel here again next year! Mike Humphreys Designation Had a lot of fun, very nice place with fun Putt-Putt holes. Prices weren't too bad and they also serve alcohol (wine slushies/beer) It's a very well maintained park with some challenging holes, including the \"world's longest putt-putt hole\" which is the 18th hole. We had a nice time, the employees were very nice and we all just had a fun time. I would definitely recommend to anyone that hasn't been here yet, it's a good time! 4 5  Address 234 Santa Barbara Blvd, Cape Coral, FL 33991  Phone 239-574-3939  Email info@tropicalbreezefunpark.com } Mini-Golf Hours Sunday – Saturday:  10 AM – 10PM Weather Permitting } GellyBall Hours Open Play Friday- Sunday :  5 PM – 10PM For other time slots, please call to make a reservation.

We offer a worry-free weather guarantee! If the park closes due to weather, guests will receive a free return ticket. If operations are suspended for more than 30 consecutive minutes, a rain check will be issued for a return visit. Can I drop off my children and leave? Children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult. Can we bring our own food to the park? No outside food is permitted. However, we’re happy to cater your event with a variety of food and drink options. What are your hours of operation? Mini-golf is open daily from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, while GellyBall operates Friday through Sunday from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. For other time slots, please call to make a reservation.  You can also call to find out our holiday hours. Are you hiring? Yes! We’re always looking for exceptional team members. Check out our Join Our Team page to apply. What makes your mini-golf course special? Our tropical-themed course features cascading waterfalls, adventurous holes, and the world’s longest mini-golf hole! It’s fun and challenging for all ages. How long does it take to complete the course? Most guests finish our 18-hole course in about 60-90 minutes, depending on group size and pace. What is GellyBall? GellyBall is a revolutionary, low-impact shooting game suitable for all ages. Our battery-powered blasters shoot hydrated gel orbs that are biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-staining. What is a GellyBall Blaster? The electric blaster shoots water-filled orbs. If you hold the trigger, it can fire up to 10 balls per second, quickly using up ammo. We advise players to shoot in quick bursts to conserve ammo. The ammo pod, called a “Hand Grenade,” holds 750 GellyBalls. The blaster accurately shoots up to 100 feet! Does it hurt to get shot? No, unlike paintball, the GellyBall Blaster uses very low pressure, making it virtually pain-free—only feeling like a flick of a finger. But you’ll be having so much fun, you won’t even notice! How many players can participate? We can host up to 10 players at a time, with larger groups rotating through teams to keep everyone engaged. What if I run out of ammo? Additional ammo can be purchased on-site to keep the fun going. Do you clean the equipment? Yes! Between users, we clean and disinfect the gear. Can you host private events? Absolutely! We specialize in birthday parties, corporate events, school outings, and more. Check out our Group Events and Birthday Parties pages for customizable packages. Do you offer fundraising opportunities? Yes, our fundraising program is available for schools, non-profits, and other organizations. Contact us to learn more about how we can help your group raise funds while having fun. Have More Questions? If you need additional information or have specific questions, don’t hesitate to contact us.

CHECK OUR PRICES What Our Guests Have To Say Jennifer Rodin Designation Best mini golf ever! The water features and the little signs and of course the drinks, the other customers, and the workers were just amazing! The music was really great too. We had so much fun. We'll definitely be back again! Coleen Wybranski Designation We chose this as an alternative to Topgolf, and are so glad that we did — it was a miles better alternative for our young family. The staff was super sweet and attentive, and nowhere else will you find such a prompt on-course delivery service! The next time we’re in Florida we’re definitely going to make this a destination. Tiffany Rollman Designation This was hands down the best maintained course my kids and I have ever been on. The kids loved the different challenges on each hole and the electronic score card was an awesome addition. It is clear that the staff care about the upkeep, because the course is in pristine condition and they do a stunning job with the landscaping. We definitely plan to come back when we travel here again next year! Mike Humphreys Designation Had a lot of fun, very nice place with fun Putt-Putt holes. Prices weren't too bad and they also serve alcohol (wine slushies/beer) It's a very well maintained park with some challenging holes, including the \"world's longest putt-putt hole\" which is the 18th hole. We had a nice time, the employees were very nice and we all just had a fun time. I would definitely recommend to anyone that hasn't been here yet, it's a good time! 4 5 Make Every Visit More Rewarding! Turn your fun into rewards with the Tropical Breeze Loyalty Program!
