Hosting the large family on his estate is Elio (Riccardo Scamarcio, also at MJFF with The Shadow of the Day ), an even-keeled, non-devout Catholic who is at loose ends since his wife left him. In this bucolic setting, Elio meets quick-tempered Esther, the rebellious rabbi’s daughter, who is trapped between affection for her family and the desire to emancipate herself from Orthodox life. At age 26, she is under much family pressure to marry. Through their time together, Esther discovers her own path, and Elio finds the inner peace he has long sought. Sponsors Tammy & Jay Levine, and Elena & Lee Salomon Director's Bio Directed by Stéphane Freiss Stéphane Freiss is a French film, television, and stage actor who has appeared in more than 90 films, most notably in Agnes Varda’s Vagabond (1985) and Steven Spielberg’s Munich (2005).

He is a fine young man. As Igor and his team prepare for the MJFF annual event, let me spotlight several films that embody the essence of Igor’s love of movies and his vision without delving into the pain and sadness of today’s messy politics. • “Film Geek” is a joyous and emotional look back at a movie obsessed kid growing up in New York City, and his relationship with his mysterious father. This passion, reminiscent of “Cinema Paradiso” and its kiss scene, is crafted entirely out of film clips from more than 200 movies, as well as his personal archives. Emmy and DGA award-winning director Richard Shepard searches for the reasons that have created this powerful fascination in him. The film explores the love of movies through clips intertwined with teenaged movies made by Shepard and his friends with deeply personal details of family life. The roll call of films ranges from intellectual to rough, just like all of our own film evolution. • “The City” captures individuals exploring love, ambition, and resilience amidst the vibrant chaos of city life. Inspired by black music, film noir and detective films, the plot focuses on Joe, a cynical and bitter detective working in a corrupt, decaying city. Some have labeled it the first Hebrew rap musical. • “Victory” centers around the pursuit of triumph celebrating the human spirit’s ability to achieve shared goals. • “The Catskills” revisits a bygone era within the Catskills, reflecting on the importance of shared spaces in cultivating unity and preserving heritage. Lex Gillespie’s documentary tells the story of the rise and fall of “the Jewish Alps” outside New York City, when Mrs. Maisel met Dirty Dancing. MJFF always provides a platform for interaction and engagement. Panel discussions, filmmaker insights, and community events further conversations, encouraging deeper understanding. As STEM studies have replaced Humanities as a so-called essential course of study, it is repeatedly hinted – a computer coder earns more than an English major. This is a terrible shame. Simply, look at the lack of humanity, the ethical failures, and the heartless cruelty which seems increasingly evident each day. The Miami Jewish Film Festival has always stood as a testament to the power of art to unite. Through its dedication to narratives that try to bridge divides, it embodies the values of inclusivity and shared humanity, while it reinforces the importance of empathy, understanding, and connection in today’s world. The festival is slated to captivate audiences from January 11th to January 25th 2024. Screenings will take place across venues such as the Michael-Ann Russell JCC, Miami Theater Center, Temple Beth Am, Coral Gables Art Cinema, O Cinema South Beach, and a few more. As the festival approaches, it invites all to partake in this celebration of cultural diversity, unity, and transformative storytelling. Through these films and engaging events, it’s an opportunity to reflect, connect, and embrace the vibrant tapestry of our collective journey.

Mr. Haffman is the owner and gifted jeweler of a humble shop in Paris, but when the Germans occupy the city and instruct all Jews to wear a yellow star, he and his family plan to evacuate. Unable to get out in time and having already signed his store over to his ambitious employee François Mercier and his wife Blanche (Sara Giraudeau, star of MJFF 2021 film If You See My Mother ), Mr. Haffmann now finds himself at their mercy not to turn him into Nazi officers, whose presence in the city grows by the day. As the couple move in to the Haffmann home, the agreement turns into a Faustian bargain that will forever change the fate of all. Rich in moral complexity and empathy, Farewell, Mr. Haffmann follows in the tradition of Francois Truffaut’s Academy Award-winning The Last Metro and Joseph Losey’s Mr. Klein . One of the biggest box office hits of the year in France, this period drama is a transfixing humanist portrait of survival and resistance, as well as the tragic consequences of complicity and collaboration. Sponsors Cindy & Mark Soloway, and Dr. & Mrs. Elliott & Tracey Stein Director's Bio Directed by Fred Cavayé Fred Cavayé is a French photographer and director who came to the world of film from fashion photography. He is best known for his feature films Anything for Her (2008) starring Diane Kruger, Point Blank (2010), and The Next Three Days (2010) starring Russel Crowe, Liam Neeson, and Elizabeth Banks.

To say we couldnât do it without you would be an understatement. With the support and commitment from film lovers like you, in 2020, when so many organizations were forced to pull back or slow down, the Miami Jewish Film Festival didn't skip a beat! You inspired us to work our hardest to continue providing opportunities for more than 25,000 individuals at every age and stage of life to connect with the Festival and celebrate their love of film, their Jewish identities, and each other! None of this would have been possible without the generosity of dedicated community members like you. With our live programs suspended in 2020, you have kept the Miami film community alive. And one of the most heartening ways you have done that is by sharing your stories of when the Festival and film have left an impact on your life. We have been moved by those stories, so as we end the year, we wanted to share a few with you: Adriana Halac, MJFF Member \"The opportunity MJFF has given us to be the first to witness a new film surrounded by the âmakersâ is an experience that compares when we watch a newborn. And to be able to share that feeling with our community is invaluable, especially now that we miss the amazing experience to be together sharing what we love.\" Tammy Aronson, MJFF Board Member \"One of my fondest memories of MJFF dates back to 2013 at the former O Cinema. It was a three-film marathon day for me, and I had been waiting for my last film to start when a couple I didnât know took the seats next to me. We struck up a lively conversation â about movies, what we liked, and what we were hotly anticipating â and before we knew it the film had started. To this day, I look forward to seeing that couple at every MJFF. Weâve exchanged film notes for 7 years now and thinking of them brings me a smile. This memory reminds me of how much I enjoy the festival, not only for the wonderful people I meet but for the sense of community we feel together and of course, the incredible films we get to discover.\" Malka Mordujovich, MJFF Member \"Year after year I look forward to the MJFF, it's the time to travel all around the world, without leaving Miami, and always I end up enriched, entertained and culturally growing from the experience. Many movies resonate in different ways. Right now I remember the feeling, after the documentary Ben-Gurion, Epilogue where his grandson Alon was in attendance. I told him that I met his grandfather 60 years ago in a kibbutz when I was in a program in Israel and his words are etched forever in my memory: \"Girls like you we need in the Negev\". Next day, same festival year (2018), I was transported again to that historical time, by the movie An Israeli Love Story , and all the juices, splendor, and emotions of youth, surged back, and I left the theater being 18-years-old again!\" Steven Oritt, Director of My Name Is Sarah \"My favorite experience at the Miami Jewish Film Festival was walking up on stage and introducing the North American premiere of my filmÂ My Name is Sara , to a sold out theater. I was born and raised in Miami and being able to first share the film with so many close friends and family in attendance, was very special. Looking out on the hundreds of people sitting there and seeing so many smiling, recognizable faces is a memory I'll never forget.\" Alison Mars, MJFF Board Member \"One of the highlights of this past yearâs Miami Jewish Film Festival was the inaugural Shabbat Dinner for filmmakers. It was fascinating to interact and have one on one conversation with such talented film directors and producers. Hearing their stories and engaging in dialogue added insight and value to the films weâd be watching throughout the festival.\" Michelle Rosinek, MJFF Member \"Over the years and especially this past season, the most memorable events for me were meeting and greeting the many fans of movies as well as the guest speakers that were highlighted during the 2-week festival.\" Tod Lending, Director of Saul & Ruby, To Life! \"I had numerous wonderful experiences at the Miami JFF and there were a few that stood out as highlights for me. The first highlight was the Opening Night celebration that started with a beautiful reception of food, music, and pure celebration before my film screened to a sold-out audience. Following the screening, the two main characters of the film, both holocaust survivors, played their music to the audience and they were shown great respect and appreciation by the crowd. This touched me deeply and meant a great deal to the two survivors. Finally, there was a reception for filmmakers and other people associated with the festival at a private home and that was a beautiful time to meet new people, share ideas, and develop new friendships.\" Hilda Peljovich, MJFF Member \"One of my greatest joys is attending the MJFF. Each year I dedicate two weeks to the festival â it's like making believe I'm traveling out of the country for two weeks and these are the tours I choose. Each movie is a different âexcursionâ and it is a terrific escape. I laugh and I cry and I learn a lot. It is an amazing experience and I look forward to the Festival every year.\" Ferenc TÃ¶rÃ¶k, Director of 1945 \"My last movie 1945 received its World Premiere at the 2017 Miami Jewish Film Festival. What many people don't realize is that it premiered two weeks before the first official Berlinale screening! It's unheard of for a film to choose to not world premiere at the Berlinale, but it was one of the smartest decisions I ever made. I worked on 1945 for nearly 10 years. From the cold Hungarian winter it was a miracle to arrive at beautiful sunny and warm Miami. If it wasn't for the team at the Miami Jewish Film Festival, I would never have been able to secure theatrical distribution, which led to my film playing all over America, generating incredible press, and making more than $1 million dollars at the box office. It was all because of the Miami Jewish Film Festival and its amazing audience and team! I am forever grateful to the festival, I wouldn't have been able to achieve so many of my dreams without its tremendous support.\" Michelle Hershenson, MJFF Member \"My very favorite MJFF memory is the Sunday in 2015 when we, as usual, chose to attend three movies. I believe the second movie of the day was Beneath the Helmet . When the movie ended, the entire audience broke into thunderous, spontaneous applause. It was a thrilling experience and later listening to the film's director and soldier from the movie was the icing on the cake.\" Sharon & Kenny Glick, MJFF Members & Volunteers \"For the past many years as Festival volunteers, it was with pride and excitement that we saw our community happily step into theaters eager to share Jewish stories, traditions, values, and wonders in film.\" Aaron Wolf, Director of Restoring Tomorrow \"Being a guest of the Miami Jewish Film Festival was an extraordinary honor and I didn't know it would be that until I got there. The entire Festival team brings such a passion that it rubs off on the audience and it rubs off on the guests, like me, creating an unforgettable excitement. Here's to you guys at MJFF! Keep bringing that passion as we rise above this pandemic with our love of film!\" Thank you all for being part of this film community and for your love of film. In this season of giving, consider counting the Miami Jewish Film Festival amongst your charitable priorities and help us continue providing these unique and meaningful experiences for our community. The work that we do to sustain our community is more important now than ever. Though this year has looked much different than previous ones, our core belief remains the same as it was in 1997 when the Miami Jewish Film Festival launched its inaugural edition: community matters, diversity in storytelling matters, and film matters. By supporting our Festival, you are sharing your love of film and helping us strengthen our platform for our upcoming 24th Annual Edition, occurring April 14-29, 2021, and featuring the largest film program that we've ever assembled! Thank you for all you do to help sustain a vibrant and thriving Jewish life in our beloved magic city!

Skip to main content About Us Contact Us FAQ Festival Archive History Security Venues Volunteer Membership Donate Membership Next Wave News In the News The Latest Schedule Calendar Events Sponsors 2026 Sponsors Become a Sponsor Donate Dec 13, 2023 The 2024 Festival Program is Here! The Miami Jewish Film Festival (MJFF) proudly presents the program for its upcoming 27th edition, a dynamic hybrid of virtual and live events featuring 120 films. Running from January 11-25, 2024, the festival will showcase 94 feature films and 26 shorts from 25 countries, including 10 world premieres, 10 international premieres, 12 North American premieres, and 7 US premieres. Notably, 41 films (34% of the total program) are directed by women, with 40 first-time feature filmmakers. As the largest Jewish film festival in America, MJFF's 27th Edition will offer over 80 in-theater screenings across eight venues in Greater Miami, including Miami Beach, Coral Gables, and North Miami. Additionally, an online component will make over 80 films available for streaming throughout Florida and the United States. To enhance accessibility, most English language titles will feature closed captioning, thanks to a grant from the Miami Jewish Abilities Alliance. â¢ Opening and Closing Night Spectacles: The Festivalâs opening night film is James Hawesâ One Life starring Sir Anthony Hopkins as Sir Nicholas Winton, a British stockbroker who helped rescue hundreds of children as the world was on the brink of WWII, an act of compassion that was almost forgotten for 50 years. The event will include the presence of acclaimed screenwriter Lucinda Coxon, who will provide an introduction and engage in a conversation following the film's premiere. The Festivalâs closing night will feature the premiere of The Monkey House by renowned Israeli filmmaker Avi Nesher, which was nominated for 11 Israeli Academy Awards. Both events will be held at the historic Miami Beach Bandshellâs open-air amphitheater. One Life starring Sir Anthony Hopkins â¢ International Guests: Among the 30 international guests attending this yearâs festival are Stephen Lang ( Avatar ) and Elsie Fisher ( Eighth Grade ) for the premiere of their emotional drama Avenue of the Giants , and Emmy-winning director Richard Shepard who will attend the premiere of his personal documentary Film Geek as well host a special 35mm presentation of Barry Levinsonâs Diner . â¢ Spotlight on Israeli Cinema: Given the recent tragic events in Israel and rising antisemitism around the world, MJFF emphasizes its commitment to fostering empathy and understanding through cinema, with a focus on Israel's pivotal role in the Jewish narrative. This yearâs Festival presents the worldâs largest Israeli film program with 31 feature film premieres.

Seven Blessings, Israel's Academy Award Entry â¢ âMade in Floridaâ Focus: Reinforcing its dedication to showcasing local emerging talent, the Miami Jewish Film Festival shines a spotlight on âMade in Floridaâ movies this year, featuring three films receiving their world premieres. The lineup includes Between the Stone and the Flower , chronicling the remarkable odyssey of acclaimed Miami author Genie Milgram on her decades-long quest to trace her Jewish lineage; as well as the emotional tale Sholem Soul Goal , which captures a Miami family grappling with the loss of their youngest son; while the powerful saga The Boy in the Woods unfolds the astonishing true-life story of Holocaust survivor of Maxwell Smart, a South Florida resident. Other Florida-focused stories premiering at the Festival include the new ChaiFlicks production Schmoozing and Cruising , a sumptuous journey delving into the diverse and flavorful world of Kosher cuisine; and the poignant short film Jack & Sam , about the miraculous reunion of two Holocaust survivors after 80 years. â¢ Community Engagement: Since the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, the Miami Jewish Film Festival has been actively creating additional avenues for the community to come together in shared grief, companionship, and solidarity. Serving as a beacon of hope, the Festival aims to illuminate the path forward through the transformative power of film. In response to recent events, the Festival is organizing several community-driven events, free and open to the public. These include a family-friendly outdoor presentation of Israeli filmmaker Ariel Folmanâs animated feature Where Is Anne Frank and a special presentation of Hope Without Boundaries , a profound film highlighting the Israeli field hospitalâs dedication to providing medical care for victims in the Ukraine war. The filmâs premiere will feature the filmâs subject and Shebaâs Field Hospital Director Yoel Har-Even in attendance. â¢ Building Bridges/Breaking Barriers Program: To further its mission as a premier platform for the finest Jewish and Israeli cinema globally, MJFF is bolstering several innovative programs and initiatives this year. Notably, the festival is amplifying its Building Bridges/Breaking Barriers program, which is dedicated to presenting stories that emphasize the power inherent in the connection between the Black and Jewish communities during a period marked by escalating racism and antisemitism. Highlighted films in this program include the impactful Rabbi on the Block , featuring director Brad Rothschild and film subject Tamar Menasseh participating in a panel discussion, as well as the documentary One Struggle which chronicles the historic alliance between African Americans and American Jews during the Civil Rights Movement. Another noteworthy inclusion is the SXSW acclaimed film This World Is Not My Own , offering a profound exploration of the extraordinary artistry of Nellie Mae Rowe, the daughter of a former slave who created brilliant art in obscurity. Avenue of the Giants starring Stephen Lang & Elsie Fisher â¢ Next Wave Competition: Participating in the Festivalâs Next Wave Competition, a sidebar judged by 21-to-35-year-old college students and young professionals, are engaging films such as the inspiring dance documentary Call Me Dancer ; the Berlinale title Delegation portraying three Israeli teens on a class trip to Holocaust sites in Poland; the Israeli romantic charmer Elik & Jimmy ; the musical comedy, Less Than Kosher , exploring a 30-year-old singerâs spiritual discovery; and the moving coming-of-age story, Sand Flakes , following an Israeli teen growing up in an isolated Negev town. â¢ Holocaust Education: Collaborating with the Holocaust Memorial Miami Beach, the Festival is hosting multiple free community screenings featuring films centered around Holocaust themes, including the audience award-winning documentaries UnBroken , with director Beth Lane in attendance, and Aviva Kampnerâs heartfelt film A Pocketful of Miracles , with the filmmaker also set to attend the Festival.

The Spoils delves into the global debate over the rightful ownership of art plundered during World War II, centering on the case of Max Stern, a German-Jewish art dealer expelled from Düsseldorf in 1937. After his forced liquidation, Stern became one of Canada’s most prominent art dealers, with his heirs now leading efforts in art restitution. Chronicling the Düsseldorf City Museum’s failed attempt to host an exhibition in Stern’s honor, the film presents an eye-opening account of the heated disputes with exclusive interviews and rare archival footage. The Spoils offers a gripping, poignant insight into the complex moral and legal dilemmas that continue to shape the art world today. This special premiere event will include the attendance of director Jamie Kastner and film subject Clarence Epstein, who will introduce the film and participate in a Q&A after the screening. Sponsors Becky & Laurence Herrup Director's Bio Directed by Jamie Kastner Jamie Kastner is a documentary filmmaker known for films such as There Are No Fakes , The Skyjacker’s Tale , and Secret Disco Revolution . His films span genres including true crime, political thriller, and historical documentary, and have premiered at festivals like TIFF, London, and Rotterdam.

The synagogue live-streamed its services via Facebook, and the streaming continued throughout the hostage situation, viewed by more than 4,000 people. The media around the world followed the breathtaking drama with more than 200 local, state, and federal law enforcement officials, including a SWAT team, at the scene, in addition to 70 FBI hostage negotiators and rescue operatives. Add to that phone recordings made that day—from congregants, the attacker, and the FBI—plus appearances by President Biden and then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and the film plays like an episode of 24 , with multiple real-time views from inside the premises as the hostage crisis unfolded. The result is nothing short of a high-octane thriller that ultimately serves to remind us that in our darkest moments, we bring light. Directed by award-winning filmmaker Dani Menkin ( On the Map, Picture of His Life ), this gripping real-life drama captures the resilience and courage of the hostages, featuring never-before-seen footage that offers a unique perspective on the international event that captivated the world. This special premiere event will include the attendance of director Dani Menkin, who will introduce the film and participate in a Q&A after the screening. Sponsors Faye Tzippy Holand Director's Bio Directed by Dani Menkin Dani Menkin is a writer, director, and producer who was born in Tel Aviv.

All Theater Badge Holders and Ticket Holders must be seated 15 minutes before showtime to guarantee their seats. Empty seats will be sold to Rush Line patrons. All seats are general admission, and multiple-seat saving is not permitted. Please understand there is select, limited reserved seating for certain level of members and sponsors. What if Iâm late to a screening? Late seating is not guaranteed. If you arrive late, and seats are still available, you may be seated at the discretion of the Theater Manager. Please keep in mind, if it is a sold out show, remaining empty seats are sold to the Rush Line 15 minutes before show time. We strongly encourage you to arrive and be seated 15 minutes prior to the published show start time. What are Rush Tickets? Rush tickets are sold 10 minutes before showtime at the theater where the film is being shown. If a film is at Rush, it means that there are no more advance sales tickets for that screening. We try to accommodate all pass holders and ticket holders up until 15 minutes prior to the screening. If there are any available seats, tickets will be sold to the Rush Line on a first come, first serve basis. If you are not seated 15 minutes before showtime, you are in danger of your seat being sold to the Rush Line. Can I reserve tickets? Tickets are either purchased or not purchased. They cannot be reserved. Can I get tickets for other days/theatres at any box office? Yes! All Theater Box Offices can process advanced ticket purchases. The immediate screening has priority with ticket sales over advanced ticket sales; this allows proper timing for theater traffic to run smoothly. Can I get day of show tickets at the box office? Yes! On the day of the screening, tickets are for sale at all of the venues and online, subject to availability. The theater box offices open 1 hour before the first screening of the day and closes 30 minutes after the last screening. If day-of-show tickets are no longer available, you can always try the Rush Line! Can I swap my tickets? Unfortunately, no. Due to limited capacities at each theater, we can only honor the tickets you purchased. Can I get a refund? Unfortunately, no. We do not allow exchanges or refunds. All orders are final. What if I lost my tickets? Unfortunately, we cannot reprint tickets. The FestivalÂ is not responsible for lost, stolen, forgotten or damaged tickets. What is a Member?

With this recognition,Â MJFF continues to make history as the only Jewish film festival ever to be named Â to MovieMakerâs annual list, which highlights festivals that filmmakers and audiences alike regard as transformative experiences.Â The 2025 edition of the list celebrates festivals that exhibitÂ exceptional programming, hospitality, audience engagement, and cultural impact . This latest honor from MovieMaker MagazineÂ reflects the Festivalâs enduring commitment to excellence and its growing influence on the international stage . Â It stands asÂ a testament to the thousands of supporters, artists, and community members Â who continue to championÂ MJFFâs mission to bridge cultures, foster meaningful dialogue, and amplify Jewish voices Â through the power of cinema. Â Now in its 29th year,Â MJFF has grown to become the largest Jewish cultural event in the world and the largest Jewish film program ever presented , drawing an expansive audience of over 58,500 attendees across South Florida and beyond. Â In its most recent edition, the Festival showcasedÂ more than 120 films, supported over 100 filmmakers and artists , and hosted an array of premieres, panel discussions, and community events that underscored its role as a convener of culture, connection, and inclusion. Â A Cultural Beacon Amid Rising Antisemitism Â As antisemitism and hate crimes rise across the globe,Â the Miami Jewish Film Festival stands at the forefront of a cultural response that emphasizes empathy, understanding, and the power of storytelling . Â Through its films and programs, MJFF provides a vital platform for stories that are often marginalized,Â giving voice to Jewish and Israeli filmmakers and illuminating a rich tapestry of global Jewish life . Â This yearâs festival program wasÂ enriched through our partnership with the Adult Learning Department of CAJE , withÂ 80% of films premiering alongside an educational component such as a Q&A, talk-back, or panel discussion . Â Many of these conversations were thoughtfullyÂ moderated by professionals selected by Dr. Bella Krieger, Director of Adult Learning, adding depth and insight Â that made the film experience even more meaningful and impactful for the community. Â The FestivalâsÂ year-round efforts include educational initiatives, artist fellowships, filmmaker residencies, and partnerships with schools, synagogues, and civic institutions , reflecting its deep investment in community engagement and impact. Looking Ahead to the 29th Edition in 2026 Â The 29th edition ofÂ the Miami Jewish Film Festival will return January 15-29, 2026 , continuing its tradition of transforming Miami into a dynamic hub of international cinema, cultural exchange, and artistic discovery. Â The upcoming Festival is expected to build on past successes whileÂ introducing new venues, expanded programs, and collaborative projects Â designed to further elevate Jewish and Israeli voices in the cinematic arts. Â Submissions for the 2026 Festival are now officially open via FilmFreeway Â and are encouraged by filmmakers of all backgrounds whose work aligns with the Festivalâs mission of storytelling, inclusion, and cultural exploration.

From the start, I was drawn to CAJEâs mission of strengthening Jewish education across the community. Over the years Iâve worn many hats at CAJE, but I found my place in the area of professional development. That passion has led me to work with leading organizations like the Jewish New Teacher Project and Learning Forward because I believe the best way to build strong schools is by supporting its professionals. I have seen through my work that when we invest in educators, the ripple effect on children, families, and communities is exponential. And speaking of families, I am proud that my own children are products of Miami Jewish day schools. - Valerie Mitrani More News » Living with Complexity and Nuance: Double Exposure I was eight years old in Basel, Switzerland, the day I learned about the way places have layers. It was a chilly, autumn Shabbos, and my father and I were on a walk by the river. My father pointed out different sights as we walked: there is the house where his elementary school friend lived. There is the gate they walked through to get to school, there is the shop run by the woman rumored to be a witch. And there, he said, pointing to a small, shady area, is the place where they burned the Jews in the 14th century. The rest of the afternoon was like a double exposure... For the first time, I began to understand what it is like when something so beautiful becomes, while retaining all its magic, something terrible as well. More News » The Urgency of Memory: Ensuring Teens Walk with Survivors There is nothing more powerful than looking into the eyes of a Survivor and hearing, âI was there.â Soon, that moment will no longer be possible. Our teens are the last generation who can hear history from the people who lived it. That opportunity is precious, and it is disappearing. Earlier this year, Future of Jewish reflected on the urgency of Holocaust education. With fewer than 200,000 Survivors remaining worldwide and many unable to travel, the article reminds us that we are now responsible for ensuring the next generation understands not only what was lost, but what continues to endure.

In the heart of Tel Aviv's Neve Tzedek neighborhood, a deteriorated house serves as a refuge for youth from troubled backgrounds. Jackie (Roy Assaf, MJFF 2019 film The Art of Waiting ), a young man thrust into the role of running the shelter after the unexpected passing of its legendary founder, discovers that the old house actually belongs to the Tel Aviv municipality and, even worse, has been acquired by a businessman with intentions to demolish it and construct a boutique hotel on its ruins. Together with the house’s at-risk youth, Jackie launches a relentless campaign against the municipality’s representatives to save the house, which, for the youth it shelters, is their last refuge, their last lifeline. Director's Bio Directed by Erez Tadmor Erez Tadmor is one of Israel's most renowned contemporary filmmakers, winning over 40 international prizes, including at the Sundance Film Festival, Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and Jerusalem Film Festival. His films have regularly premiered at the Miami Jewish Film Festival, such as the acclaimed dramas A Matter of Size (2009), Magic Men (2014), Wounded Land (2015), The Art of Waiting (2019), and Matchmaking (2023).

This yearâs partnership is all the more exciting as it will be taking place as part of the Cinemathequeâs ongoing Interactive Archive Project, which will feature on display rare posters, brochures, and memorabilia. The 1940âs section of the digital project will be revealed on November 28 before the final screening. The series will honor three pioneering filmmakers, each of whom were American Jews or European Jewish immigrants, who shaped the dominant narrative and visual styles of classic film noir. From November 7 through 28, three defining noir films will be shown in newly restored digital presentations for one-night-only at the Miami Beach Cinematheque and hosted by several special guests. The series kicks-off with Michael Curtizâs Mildred Pierce (1945), in which Joan Crawford delivers an Academy Award-winning performance as a woman clawing her way to success, followed by Robert Siodmakâs Academy Award-nominated The Killers (1946) which helped defined the noir style and launched the acting careers of Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner. Closing the series is Ida Lupinoâs The Hitch-Hiker (1953), a tour-de-force thriller that is the only true film noir ever directed by a woman. The closing evening will feature an MBC Interactive Archive overview of the 1940s to put Film Noir in a larger context of world film history and also a special reception featuring Coppola Wines, one of the sponsors of the ongoing archive project at MBC. All films will be presented at the Miami Beach Cinematheque. Tickets are available to buy in advance online or at the theater's box office. MJFF Members are privileged to receive an exclusive discount and must email info@miamijewishfilmfestival.org to acquire it.
