Dustin and the staff were friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and made the entire experience from the beginning of the process of reserving the boat to getting on the water extremely smooth. My family and I had a great time. If you enjoy boating and being on the water, MDBC is the place to go! Anthony Ards Best experience. Nice, clean place with lots of boats to choose. Wonderful and helpful staff. Highly recommend! Michelle “Shelley” Stepp Julia and her staff were amazing to work with! They have fantastic rental craft with superior customer service. The ins and outs of our particular boat were throughly explained to us, we were given a map of the Chain of Lakes, and they were waiting for us when we returned to help us dock the boat. They even have complimentary beach carts to use so you don’t have to lug all of your gear to and from the parking lot. Every detail has been thought of by this group, highly recommend! Elite Veterinary Home Care Our family rented a pontoon boat this past weekend. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful. The boat was clean, fueled and ready to go. Great weekend thanks to Mount Dora Boating Center. Scott Leeds Did an all day Saturday rental of a Starcraft CX 23 pontoon boat and loved it. Excellent service and excellent equipment. Highly recommend renting the tube rental add on as it’s a lot of fun. Luis Segarra Testimonial with Jeff Rubenthaul Subscribe to Our Newsletter Sign up for our newsletter to get a weekly digest.

View All Testimonials Mount Dora Boating Center is amazing! Dustin and the staff were friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and made the entire experience from the beginning of the process of reserving the boat to getting on the water extremely smooth. My family and I had a great time. If you enjoy boating and being on the water, MDBC is the place to go! Anthony Ards Best experience. Nice, clean place with lots of boats to choose. Wonderful and helpful staff. Highly recommend! Michelle “Shelley” Stepp Julia and her staff were amazing to work with! They have fantastic rental craft with superior customer service. The ins and outs of our particular boat were throughly explained to us, we were given a map of the Chain of Lakes, and they were waiting for us when we returned to help us dock the boat. They even have complimentary beach carts to use so you don’t have to lug all of your gear to and from the parking lot. Every detail has been thought of by this group, highly recommend! Elite Veterinary Home Care Our family rented a pontoon boat this past weekend. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful. The boat was clean, fueled and ready to go. Great weekend thanks to Mount Dora Boating Center. Scott Leeds Did an all day Saturday rental of a Starcraft CX 23 pontoon boat and loved it. Excellent service and excellent equipment. Highly recommend renting the tube rental add on as it’s a lot of fun. Luis Segarra Testimonial with Jeff Rubenthaul Subscribe to Our Newsletter Sign up for our newsletter to get a weekly digest.
