Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Waiver Any action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether in contract or tort, statutory or common law, legal or equitable, or under any law, between you and the Cooper’s Hawk (the “Parties”) now existing or hereafter arising under or in connection with, or in any way pertaining to, your use of the Services or these Terms (“Dispute”) will be resolved expeditiously in accordance with the procedures outlined below. The Parties do not intend for the procedures outlined below to supplant the routine handling of inquiries and complaints through informal contact with customer service representatives or other designated personnel of Cooper’s Hawk. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY THESE TERMS, EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND COOPER’S HAWK EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION EITHER AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OR AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE. ANY ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WITHOUT THE RIGHT FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION BASIS. a) Pre-Arbitration. The complaining party or the complaining party’s representative will notify the other party’s representative in writing of the Dispute (the “Notice”), and the non-complaining party will confer with the complaining party and exercise good faith efforts to resolve the matter as expeditiously as possible. Cooper’s Hawk’s address for the Notice is: Member & Guest Services, Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurants 3500 Lacey Road, Suite 1000 Downers Grove, IL 60515. In the event that such matter remains unresolved thirty (30) days after the delivery of the complaining party's written notice, the complaining party may pursue the Dispute in arbitration as set forth herein, and except as otherwise provided below. b) Exceptions. Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to pursue enforcement actions or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (including without limitation patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets), and either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. c) Governing Rules. Arbitration proceedings will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the terms herein and any such rules, the terms herein will control. The arbitration will be conducted at a mutually-agreed upon location in the jurisdiction whose Law govern the Terms (“Arbitration Location”), or as selected by the AAA or other administrator if no agreement can be reached; and the parties hereby waive any claim of forum non convenience. All statutes of limitation applicable to any Dispute will apply to any arbitration proceeding. All discovery activities will be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the Dispute being arbitrated. Judgment upon any award rendered in an arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings between Parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. d) Arbitrator Powers; Awards. Arbitrators are empowered to resolve Disputes by summary rulings in response to motions filed prior to the final arbitration hearing. Arbitrators: (a) will resolve all Disputes in accordance with the substantive law of the State of Illinois, (b) may grant any remedy or relief that a court could order or grant and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any such award, and (c) will have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other actions as they deem necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure. The arbitrators have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement, to include the threshold question of arbitrability. e) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the arbitrators and the Parties will take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the filing of the Dispute. No arbitrator or other party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a party required in the ordinary course of its business, by applicable law, or to the extent necessary to exercise judicial review rights as set forth herein. This arbitration provision will survive termination, amendment or expiration of the Terms or any relationship between the parties. f) Fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Cooper’s Hawk will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrators find the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Cooper’s Hawk will pay the fees invoiced by AAA, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees, unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrators find that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Cooper’s Hawk for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrators must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrators may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. g) Modifications. If Cooper’s Hawk makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to its address for the Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice, in which case, if you have a User Account your account will be immediately terminated, and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will survive. 17.

Waiver Failure or delay by Cooper’s Hawk to exercise any right, power, privilege or remedy shall not constitute a waiver thereof. No modification or waiver by Cooper’s Hawk of any provision shall be deemed to have been made unless made in writing. 19.
