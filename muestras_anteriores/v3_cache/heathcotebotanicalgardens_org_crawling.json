Smith James J. Smith (1925-2016) was noted as the gentleman of bonsai and is recognized as a world class Bonsai Master. His knowledge of tropical and semi-tropical Bonsai was sought after not only by students but also bonsai masters alike. His artistic ability to design classical and natural styles of bonsai goes unchallenged. His foresight to see the artistic development in raw stock was magical. (Photo by Eric Hasert, Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers. Copyright, 2011, Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers, used here with permission. No additional reproduction or distribution of this photo in any form is permitted without the written approval of Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers (http://www.tcpalm.com) To those who do bonsai this is an international treasure “THE CURATOR HAS THE TREES IN GREAT SHAPE.” History of the James J. Smith Bonsai Collection In October 2009, Bonsai Master Jim Smith donated 100 of his finest bonsai to Heathcote Botanical Gardens on the condition that they would be properly maintained, displayed and protected. Unlike a traditional bonsai display lined up on benches with no competing scenery, Master Smith imagined a “Walk Through Bonsai” where visitors could stroll the beautiful Heathcote Botanical Gardens, and discover a unique bonsai tree at every turn. The horticultural requirements of bonsai made installing them into the existing gardens impractical, and so a unique and original garden was planned by Sam Comer of Hayslip Landscape, with guidance from Master Smith and Jim Van Landingham. Master Smith pioneered the use of tropical species such as portulacaria afra, (the dwarf leaf jade tree) as bonsai, and used many Florida native species to interpret the ancient art of bonsai. Sam Comer’s garden design and the architectural contributions of Peter Moor serve as a metaphor for Master Smith’s work. Elements of a traditional Japanese Garden (stone, gravel, limited landscape palette) are interpreted through native Florida plants and building materials. “It’s where sushi meets fried mullet!” says architect Peter Moor. The Bonsai Pavilion, designed by Moor, serves to host performances, weddings, and more. For more information on holding your event at Heathcote, view our Event Rental page. Using Landscape Architect Rodney Robinson’s master plan as guide, the new Bonsai Garden was placed on the south east corner of the existing five-acre botanical garden. The 10,000 square foot area was originally where the Crimmins’ family nursery received clients. During Heathcote’s early years, the Fort Pierce Orchid Society, the Heathcote Herb Society, Eddie Eggers and many dedicated volunteers built various structures and garden features, including the Herb House, Orchid House, and the Lib Tobey Rainforest Memorial. The ravages of time, tropical elements, and the twin hurricanes of 2004 damaged most of the structures beyond repair. A St. Lucie Tourist Development grant for $148,720 was matched by a $100,000 anonymous contribution, and sufficient internal resources to begin site work in August 2010. Butterfly Garden An arbor trellis covered with Dutchman’s Pipe marks one end of the curved path that meanders through Heathcote’s Butterfly Garden. At times the vine is covered with Pipevine Swallowtail butterflies. At other times you may spy their caterpillars fattening themselves on the leaves to start the next generation. The Butterfly Garden contains over 35 species of plants selected to attract butterflies. Some are host, or larval plants. Butterflies are very specific about their preferences for these. Others are nectar plants that attract a variety of butterflies. Pick a warm sunny day to see the most butterflies and rejoice to see holes in the foliage! That means more butterflies will be coming soon. Heathcote is a registered garden in the Million Pollinator Garden Challenge from the National Pollinator Garden Network. The focus of the NPGN is to inspire individuals and community groups, institutions and the garden industry to create more pollinator habitats through sustainable gardening practices, habitat conservation and provide these groups the tools to be successful. NPGN collectively represents approximately 800,000 gardeners, 20,000 schoolyard gardens and has surpassed their goal to register a million gardens! Heathcote enjoys contributing to the creation of pollinator habitats which are also beautiful and provide educational opportunities for children and all our visitors. Member Benefits Memberships start at just $45 per year and Heathcote members enjoy a variety of benefits… LEARN MORE ABOUT MEMBERSHIP Children’s Garden A special garden bed is tended by kids in our horticulture classes for children. The Children’s Garden was first dedicated in 1998 and has continued to add new items thanks to many community groups and individuals. Its most prominent feature is a chickee hut, built in the Seminole tradition with open sides and a thatched roof. A Pioneer Cabin, Eagle Scout-constructed roomy benches, and tree stump benches all provide more spots for little ones to rest and play. A playhouse, mosaic hopscotch, Fairy Garden and whimsical art pieces made from garden tools all add to the fun. Community Garden Mother Nature partners with our hard-working volunteers to produce vegetables and more in the Community Garden sponsored by the Garden Club of Fort Pierce. Local organic materials serve as mulch and compost, and no chemical fertilizers or pesticides are used. Fruit trees, herbs, and all sorts of veggies happily grow here. All the harvests are donated to Fort Pierce families in need. Harvested crops are donated to Fort Pierce families in need. Herb Garden The Herb Garden at Heathcote Botanical Gardens was started by the Heathcote Herb Society in 1994 after an herb gardening workshop brought together a diverse group of herb lovers. Heathcote’s Gardener, Miriam Charles, was a founding member of the Herb Society. She searched out rare and unusual herbs and started many of them from seed. Miriam’s particular interest was in Salvias, and you will find many lovely specimens in the Herb Garden and in Heathcote’s Color Beds. Heathcote’s Herb Society The herbs in Heathcote’s Garden range from culinary to medicinal. Some are also sources of dyes and ornamental dried bouquets. Yarrow, Rosemary, Pennyroyal and Lavender, and the seed heads of Dill and Fennel make nice dried arrangements. Basil and Bay, in addition to their culinary uses, symbolize friendship and loyalty. Geraniums are for comfort and, of course, Rosemary is for remembrance. You may also be familiar with Rose Hips as being a source of Vitamin C. Culinary herbs provided the inspiration for the Herb Society’s cookbook, Heathcote Gems: Herb Inspired Recipes, which is available in the Gift Shop. During the Dark Ages, monasteries were repositories of learning, and it was there that Fiacre became skilled at the use of healing herbs. BishopFaro, viewed Fiacre’s act as a gift from God and proclaimed it a miracle. The statue in the Herb Garden is a representation of St. Fiacre (pron. Fee-ah-kruh), an Irish monk whose feast is celebrated in Ireland and France on September 1st. He is the patron saint of gardeners (and taxi-drivers and florists among other things). Japanese Garden One of the favorite spots at Heathcote is the Japanese Garden. The original garden was created by Mollie Crimmins, known locally for her Japanese garden design. Jim and Mollie Crimmins owned Heathcote nursery and lived in the adjacent two story home that is now the administrative office. Most of Mollie Crimmins’ garden designs have been lost. Preserving this garden was one of the motivating factors in the creation of Heathcote. The size of the Japanese Garden would have been smaller (and Heathcote Drive larger) if not for Laura Baker standing in front of an overeager bulldozer driver who was determined to take more than the designated 30 feet of land for a right-of-way. The Japanese Garden here was not designed in any particular style, but it does incorporate many traditional elements and symbols. It contains pathways that direct your attention and provide an ease of footing, boulders that represent a distant mountain range, and purifying water. There is movement through a series of distinct “rooms” and through thresholds such as the entrance gate, the bridge, the opening in the hedge, and the elevated pathway. Each signifies progressions through different stages of consciousness. The replica tea house was an Eagle Scout project. Main Lawn Today, a swathe of emerald lawn offers a gathering place in the middle of the Gardens; but we can thank Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne for providing this space. Prior to the storms in 2004 this area was home to a gigantic Indian Laurel tree. It was one of many trees lost to the storms, but this led to a new use of the space as a large gathering area. Brides in white gowns, moms having Mother’s Day picnics, people relaxing to great music, bustling festivals—all these and more receive a gracious welcome on the Main Lawn. The space is bordered by spreading live oaks and vibrant flower beds. Paths lead off in all directions to other garden rooms. Relax on a bench at the edge of the lawn and decide which path to explore next. One special specimen resides on the Lawn itself. A rare triple-headed sabal palm, estimated to be over 140 years old, moved several times before coming back to Heathcote. Palm and Cycad Walk The Palm and Cycad Walk offers paths lined with unique specimens of these plants from all around tropical, sub-tropical, and warm temperate regions of the world. They come in every size and shape from the tall Satake Palm from the Ryukyu Islands to the short Spiny Dioon from Mexico. There is the Footstool Palm from the Philippines with sharp spikes on its fronds, and the graceful spreading shape of the Triangle Palm from Madagascar. Ferns and bromeliads sprout gracefully around the feet of the palms to add to natural ambiance of this Garden Room. Pioneer House, Field and FL Native Plants When you stand in the center of the Pioneer Field, you are surrounded by Florida horticulture and history. The Pioneer House, or Florida Cracker House, is a replica of the style of dwelling settlers used about two hundred years ago. Bud Adams donated the lumber milled from cypress trees that grew on the Adams Ranch. Settlers typically cooked outside and used the fireplace for warmth. Hanging quilts created separate spaces inside the one-room house. The cypress limb railing is a Native American design feature. The Field itself is a reimagining of the space following two hurricanes in 2004. When damaged trees and understory were cleared, the central field emerged as a great site for events like our educational Pioneer Days, garden festivals, and more. Native trees were added around the perimeter in 2008, and Florida’s beloved citrus has a home here too. Next to the Pioneer house, you’ll find a special gathering of Florida native plants. While they also appear throughout the garden, their grouping here shows what those early settlers found growing when they stepped outside their door. These plants, like the settlers themselves, are hardy enough for the Florida climate. Rainforest The water feature in the Rain Forest is in memory of Gloria Moore, which was made possible by designated contributions by members, volunteers, family, and friends of Gloria. The water feature idea was developed by Sam Comer, HBG Board member and was built by Florida Falls. Gloria was 1 of the “Band of 5” that founded Heathcote Botanical Gardens. After her passing in October of 2011, contributions began to come in and requests for a special memorial. Also, the Osteen Foundation through the Rotary Club of Fort Pierce donated $5,000 to the memorial. We are thankful for all the generosity and kindness from these folks whose passion was to leave a lasting memorial to “Our Founding Mother, Gloria Moore.” Reflection Garden The Reflection Garden with its circular reflection pond is intended to provide a quiet space for contemplation. It is meant to serve as a place apart from the rest of the Gardens, where the individual is invited to slow down and look within. It’s in these contemplative moments of life where we find inspiration, take comfort, and have our spirits restored.

Like many New Yorkers, the business was transplanted to Florida. In 1960 owners Jim and Mollie Crimmins moved the business from its original Florida location on west Orange Avenue to its current Fort Pierce site on Savannah Road. Then in 1972 the Crimmins moved their family home from Delaware Avenue to the nursery site. Now known as Heathcote House, the Crimmins’ home was built around 1922. Today the Frame Vernacular Style structure sits graciously amid old live oaks. Its second-floor balcony, Dade County pine floors, and quaint fireplace all add to its charm. It presently houses administrative offices. In 2001 the City Commission passed a resolution to designate it as a Historically Significant Site based on its architectural characteristics and ties to the life of the community.

Heathcote Botanical Reviews & Testimonials Heathcote Botanical Gardens 4.6 Based on 751 reviews powered by G o o g l e review us on Elijah Henry 17:56 07 Sep 22 We went to a botanical garden in Miami earlier this week, and that one was much better. However, this one was indeed lovely. The bonsai exhibit and the reflection garden are worth the visit. We also particularly enjoyed the butterfly garden. For young children or those inclined to whimsy, the enchanted forest is delightful. My wife also loved playing on the xylophone, and of course she wants you to know this, gentle reader. Evelyn Pla 21:11 20 Jul 22 Absolutely love this garden! It is quaint and manageable to enjoy in a short amount of time, but also invites you to linger as it has plenty of places to sit and enjoy the birds, butterflies, squirrels, and of course all the wonderful plants. The gift shop has unique items for garden lovers, and they sell plants too! The children’s area includes a lovely fairy garden and lots of hands on fun for curious little ones. The bonsai collection is beautifully displayed and inspired me to start a bonsai plant of my own. Can’t say enough about this wonderful little gem! Troy C. 22:14 24 May 22 We were very happy to find this tucked away spot.   We were greeted by Susan who was very friendly.  The female cat led us through the whole gardens practically. Next time I'll start at the Japanese garden first. There bonsai collection is stunning. Veterans free. We got off the path and meet two botanist trying to save the world's citrus blight, naturally. We learned so much about lady bugs/beetles and the different kinds which are a lot. My favorite is the mold eating black and white lady bug. My only request would be to relabel the plants. Many are sun bleached white and blank. Download a leaf identifier app. Some cool plants here K O 16:23 03 Apr 22 These are relatively small gardens that manage to fit in quite a lot of beauty.

Heathcote was beautiful and amazing! Walking through it was like being in an oasis. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves flowers. – Todd F. from Heathcote’s TripAdvisor page. Heathcote Botanical Gardens consists of an assortment of specialty gardens including a Japanese Garden, Reflection Garden, Herb Garden, Rainforest Display, Native Plants Garden, Secret Garden and a Palm & Cycad Walk . These areas convey an atmosphere of individual garden rooms. Through this type of garden design, you will sense the intimacy of this unique botanical garden. Gracing the areas in between these specialty gardens are borders of flowering shrubs, bulbs, trees, vines and other assorted herbaceous plants. Niches found throughout the garden provide varied microclimates, which allows the use of a wide variety of plants ranging from those found in Mediterranean climates to the Tropics. Heathcote Botanical Gardens is located on the southeast coast of Florida, in USDA PLANT HARDINESS zone 10A , and has both native Florida flora as well as exotic flora from around the world. It is uniquely situated in a biological transition zone between a warm-temperate zone to the north and a subtropical zone to the south. A transition zone contains species that are characteristic of the adjacent region to its north and south, as well as species that occur only in the transition zone. In the botanical world this is advantageous because it allows for greater diversity, which means that one may grow many kinds of plants from around the world that live under conditions associated with three climatic zones. Virtual Tour Heathcote Shares a Rich History with the Treasure Coast Our labeled, plant collections are both grouped in specific areas in the Garden and dispersed throughout the Garden. Other plants of interest that tend to capture many of our visitors’ eyes and spark numerous inquiries have also been labeled. Labeling helps the local Garden visitor determine what plants they have in their own Florida home landscapes or what plants they may want to add. Visitors from all over the US and the world find the information on the plant labels interesting and helpful. Visiting Fort Pierce?

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. OUR HISTORY A plant nursery on Heathcote Street in Scarsdale, New York, was the earliest seed of what has grown and blossomed into Heathcote Botanical Gardens. Like many New Yorkers, the business was transplanted to Florida. In 1960 owners Jim and Mollie Crimmins moved the business from its original Florida location on west Orange Avenue to its current Fort Pierce site on Savannah Road. Then in 1967 the Crimmins moved their family home from Delaware Avenue to the nursery site. Now known as Heathcote House, the Crimmins’ home was built around 1922. Today the Frame Vernacular Style structure sits graciously amid old live oaks. Its second floor balcony, Dade County pine floors, and quaint fireplace all add to its charm. It presently houses administrative offices. In 2001 the City Commission passed a resolution to designate it as a Historically Significant Site based on its architectural characteristics and ties to the life of the community. At the heart of Heathcote is its historical house, now serving as administrative offices. Jan Bals, Laura Baker, Gloria Moore, Norma Axx, Peggy Berg When the Crimmins retired, they put the property up for sale. A group of concerned citizens led by Gloria Moore, Chris Haynes, Jan Bals, Norma Carsens, Laura Baker, Gloria Rooks and Peggy Berg saw the unique beauty of the spot and worked hard to preserve it as a public botanical garden. Heathcote Botanical Gardens, Inc., was incorporated in 1985 as a non-profit; and in 1986 the property was purchased with private donations raised by Heathcote Botanical Gardens, Inc., and grants from the state, county, and city. We are fortunate to be able to share some life history of Carol Herzog who spent part of her childhood growing up in the Heathcote House. To read more about her : HerzogFullDocument . Today the non-profit continues to maintain and operate the Gardens and carry forward its mission.

Heathcote Botanical Reviews & Testimonials Heathcote Botanical Gardens 4.6 Based on 751 reviews powered by G o o g l e review us on Elijah Henry 17:56 07 Sep 22 We went to a botanical garden in Miami earlier this week, and that one was much better. However, this one was indeed lovely. The bonsai exhibit and the reflection garden are worth the visit. We also particularly enjoyed the butterfly garden. For young children or those inclined to whimsy, the enchanted forest is delightful. My wife also loved playing on the xylophone, and of course she wants you to know this, gentle reader. Evelyn Pla 21:11 20 Jul 22 Absolutely love this garden! It is quaint and manageable to enjoy in a short amount of time, but also invites you to linger as it has plenty of places to sit and enjoy the birds, butterflies, squirrels, and of course all the wonderful plants. The gift shop has unique items for garden lovers, and they sell plants too! The children’s area includes a lovely fairy garden and lots of hands on fun for curious little ones. The bonsai collection is beautifully displayed and inspired me to start a bonsai plant of my own. Can’t say enough about this wonderful little gem! Troy C. 22:14 24 May 22 We were very happy to find this tucked away spot.   We were greeted by Susan who was very friendly.  The female cat led us through the whole gardens practically. Next time I'll start at the Japanese garden first. There bonsai collection is stunning. Veterans free. We got off the path and meet two botanist trying to save the world's citrus blight, naturally. We learned so much about lady bugs/beetles and the different kinds which are a lot. My favorite is the mold eating black and white lady bug. My only request would be to relabel the plants. Many are sun bleached white and blank. Download a leaf identifier app. Some cool plants here K O 16:23 03 Apr 22 These are relatively small gardens that manage to fit in quite a lot of beauty.

Originally a plant nursery on Heathcote Street in Scarsdale, New York, the business was transplanted to Florida and in 1960 moved from the original Florida location on West Orange Avenue to its current Fort Pierce site on Savannah Road by its owners Jim and Mollie Crimmins. When the Crimmins retired, they put the property up for sale. A group of very determined ladies in a local garden club led by Gloria Moore, Chris Haynes, Jan Bals, Norma Carsens, Laura Baker, Gloria Rooks and Peggy Berg saw the unique beauty of the spot and worked hard to preserve it as a public botanical garden. Heathcote Botanical Gardens, Inc. was incorporated in 1985 as a non-profit; and in 1986 the property was purchased with private donations raised by Heathcote Botanical Gardens, Inc., and grants from the state, county, and city. Without these great women Heathcote Botanical Gardens would not be what it is today. The non-profit continues to maintain and operate the Gardens and carry forward its mission.

The garden donated over 150 pounds of produce to local church charities last year. \"We have a vegetable garden that is maintained by some of our diligent volunteers,\" Hoyos said. This tranquil oasis boasts a rich history. It started as a small nursery on Heathcote Street in Scarsdale, New York. Today, it has blossomed into the glorious gardens you see today in Fort Pierce. Like many northeasterners, the owners of the nursery escaped the cold and moved south in 1960. After their retirement, locals took on the fight to preserve the gardens. It was their grit and determination that led to the establishment of the Heathcote Botanical Gardens in 1986. \"This became a staple in the community as a green space,\" Hoyos said. \"There were several women who were very passionate about the green space, one in particular was Gloria Moore. We call her our founding mother.\" A gorilla sculpture at the site is named after Moore. \"We've commemorated her as Gloria because Gloria was that kind of force in nature, and she wanted to make sure Fort Pierce had its own claim to fame with a green space,\" Hoyos said. Moore saved the space from potential development, jumping into action one morning after getting a call from her friend. \"She said, 'You know what you have to do, you stall them until we get there.' She flew out of her house with her curlers and her slippers and literally threw herself in front of the bulldozers to stop them from taking over what would now be essentially almost a third of what the garden is today,\" recounted Hoyos. Visionaries of the past realized the importance of secluded spaces decades before the realities of our fast-paced lives today. The five-acre property is an intimate setting designed with an atmosphere of specialty garden \"rooms.\" The Japanese garden here features the largest public display of Bonsai in the country! These miniature-sized trees — some almost 100 years old — are special specimens. \"We have the finest example of a portulacaria bonsai in the world as far as we know,\" Tom Kehoe, the bonsai specialist at Heathcote, said. \"There seems to be general agreement about that.\" Several of Heathcote's bonsai trees are currently on display at Epcot in Orlando for their International Flower and Garden Festival. \"You become attached to them,\" Kehoe said. \"I've known most of these trees for 20 something years ... They become like old friends, children like.\" Every visitor can find something interesting at the gardens. \"There is something for everyone and it is right here in your backyard,\" Kehoe said. \"Be able to walk through and feel the healing powers that happen in a botanical setting.\" Whether you're young or just young at heart, a visit to Heathcote Botanical Gardens will inspire your imagination and give you a renewed sense of peace and well-being.
