A native New Yorker, Robin learned the value of philanthropy and volunteerism from her parents at an early age. She has long admired Japanese art, history, and literature.

She joined the Morikami Museum in 1995, becoming an active supporter and serving as a board member for several terms. Christine has led multiple fundraising campaigns, helped create educational programs, and played a key role in founding The Morikami Book Club, which focuses exclusively on Japanese authors and subjects.

He graduated from the University of Notre Dame, earned a graduate degree from Purdue University, and is a private pilot with several ratings. Bob is married to Bridget, whom he met in Tokyo, and they have two daughters. Juan Nogueras | Trustee Juan Nogueras was elected to the Board of Trustees in 2020. “The Morikami is a magical place. The beauty of the gardens and the quality of the exhibitions are invaluable assets to our community. I am proud to have the opportunity to help grow and further develop this remarkable institution.” Dr. Nogueras is a colorectal surgeon on staff at Cleveland Clinic, Florida, where he has served as Chief of Staff, Chief Medical Officer, and Chairman of the Division of Surgery since joining in 1991. He received his undergraduate education at Princeton University and his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, PA.

She holds a PhD and MBA from Drexel University and a BS from Boston University. As a Fulbright Specialist, she taught the first doctoral seminar in Information Systems at the Universidad de Panama.

Outside her professional interests, she enjoys ceramics, horticulture, and Ikenobo Ikebana, the classical art of Japanese flower arranging. Lauren is married to Scott Eder, and they have two grown children and several grandchildren. Mickey Rosenzweig | Trustee Mickey Rosenzweig joined the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens Board of Trustees in 2024.

In addition to his professional accomplishments, Mickey has supported several charitable and nonprofit organizations, including the American Cancer Society and State of Israel Bonds. He has received numerous awards for his work in philanthropy and leadership. Mickey’s wealth of experience and commitment to community service make him a valuable asset to the Morikami Board as the Museum continues its mission to share Japanese culture and engage with the community. Norma Geller | Trustee Norma was first introduced to the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in the winter of 1992 when she and her husband Albert visited Florida from Cleveland, Ohio. At the time, she was undergoing cancer treatment and, between treatments, visited the Museum and prayed by the lake for her recovery. Her prayers were answered, and she has been cancer-free for 32 years. She often says, “My ‘Stroll for Well-Being’ was the lake and prayers.” In March 2000, Norma and Albert became members of the Museum. Over the years, she has volunteered at events, participated in Ikebana classes, and served as a board member for many years. After learning about the need to renovate the library in 2019, she donated the funds for the new Sakai Room in memory of her husband, Albert. The room serves multiple purposes, and Norma is proud to have been involved in transforming the library into a valuable, well-used space. She currently serves on the Museum’s Development Committee and attends board meetings in Florida or via Zoom when in Cleveland. Norma is also active with the Israel Tennis and Education Centers, Friendship Circle, and John Carroll University, where she earned her undergraduate degree. She holds a Master’s in Social Work from Case Western Reserve University and served for many years on the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center Board in Cleveland. The Morikami Museum and Gardens holds a special place in her heart, and she says she will always be a member.

In the early 1900s, a group of young Japanese farmers, led by Jo Sakai, established the Yamato Colony in northern Boca Raton. Named after an ancient term for Japan, this small agricultural community aimed to introduce innovative farming practices to Florida. The settlers primarily grew pineapples and winter vegetables, but faced challenges like competition and economic changes that made farming difficult. Despite hardships, the colony grew to include families, blending Japanese traditions with life in Florida. However, by the 1940s, most colonists had left or returned to Japan. During World War II, the U.S. government took over much of the land for military use. George Sukeji Morikami, one of the last remaining settlers, stayed and later donated his land to Palm Beach County. This gift led to the creation of Morikami Park, which opened in 1977 as a cultural and educational center honoring the Yamato Colony’s legacy. Working alongside his friends, neighbors, and the Palm Beach County Department of Parks and Recreation, George Morikami helped transform his personal history into a lasting legacy—building a bridge of cultural understanding between George’s two homelands. Today, the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens features traditional Japanese architecture, three exhibition galleries, a theater, and an authentic tea house. The 16-acre Japanese gardens reflect a variety of historical styles from across Japan, thoughtfully arranged to form one harmonious landscape. With close to 7,500 art objects and artifacts, including tea ceremony items and textiles, the Morikami offers visitors a deep, immersive experience of Japanese culture and its enduring connection to Florida. Our Mission Our mission at Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens is to engage a diverse audience by presenting Japanese cultural experiences that educate and inspire. Since its opening in 1977, Morikami has been a center for Japanese arts and culture in South Florida. With rotating exhibitions, tea ceremonies performed monthly (October through May) and educational outreach programs with local schools, libraries, and organizations, Morikami strives to spread appreciation for the living culture of Japan. Museum The original building, the Yamato-kan , is modeled after a Japanese villa. It features a ring of exhibition rooms surrounding an open-air courtyard with a dry garden of gravel, pebbles, and small boulders. The Yamato-kan offers exhibits that chronicle the history of the Yamato Colony and the design philosophy of garden designer Hoichi Kurisu. The principal museum building opened in 1993 to meet popular demand for more programming and versatile facilities and to satisfy the needs of a growing community. The museum’s architecture is inspired by traditional Japanese design. The building features three exhibition galleries, a 226-seat theater, an authentic tea house with a viewing gallery, classrooms, a museum store, the Cornell Cafe, and lakeside terraces for a panoramic view while dining. The Morikami Collections house more than 7,000 Japanese art objects and artifacts, including a 500-piece collection of tea ceremony items, more than 200 textile pieces, and fine art acquisitions. Gardens The 16 acres that surround Morikami’s two museum buildings include expansive Japanese gardens with strolling paths, resting areas, our world-class bonsai collection and lakes teeming with koi and other wildlife. The wider 200-acre park features nature trails, pine forests and picnic areas. In 2001, Morikami completed a major garden expansion and renovation. The new gardens reflect major periods of Japanese garden design, from the eighth to the 20th century, and serve as an outdoor extension of the museum. According to the garden designer, Hoichi Kurisu , each garden is intended to express the character and ideas of a unique counterpart in Japan without attempting to duplicate those gardens, and seamlessly flow together as one garden. Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens, with its unique gardens and collections, is one of Palm Beach County’s most treasured cultural attractions. Located in a tranquil natural setting, Morikami invites visitors to explore its many facets and discover Florida’s heritage and its connection with Japan. Yamato Colony Pioneering Japanese in Florida Why do we find the name Yamato, an ancient name for Japan, here in Palm Beach County? Because the Yamato Colony was once a small community of Japanese farmers in present-day northern Boca Raton. The story of the Yamato Colony begins with Jo Sakai’s visit to Florida in 1903. Sakai hailed from Miyazu, Japan, and was a recent graduate of New York University. He signed an agreement with the Florida East Coast Railway to locate a proposed colony of Japanese farmers in the Boca Raton area. Shortly afterward, he returned to Japan to recruit settlers and bring them to Florida. At first, young, single men joined the Yamato Colony. For several years, these settlers grew pineapples for shipment to markets in the north. By the end of the first decade of the century, competition from Cuban pineapples had caused many area growers, including Yamato colonists, to turn to winter vegetables. Few of the settlers remained in Yamato for very long, but those who did sometimes returned to Japan briefly to marry and bring wives to the colony. Families soon grew. Ironically, prosperity during World War I and the land “boom” of the 1920s resulted in many settlers leaving. By the beginning of World War II, few Japanese remained. In May of 1942, farmland in the Yamato area still owned by Japanese settlers was confiscated by the U. S. government for a military installation. While the pioneering community of Japanese settlers are gone forever, Yamato’s name remains today. The exhibition, now housed in the Yamato-kan, has been financed in part with Historical Museums Grants-in-Aid Program assistance provided by the Division of Historical Resources, Florida Department of State, Secretary of State. Click here to see images from the Yamato Colony in the Morikami Collection Part I: An Idea is Born The story of the Yamato Colony begins with the visit to Florida in November and December of 1903 by a 29-year-old Japanese man named Jo Sakai. Sakai approached the Jacksonville Board of Trade with the idea of establishing one or more Japanese agricultural colonies in Florida. The reaction to his proposal in both business and political circles was immediately enthusiastic. Sakai soon found himself on a whirlwind tour of the state to inspect possible sites for the first of the proposed colonies. Portrait of a Colony Founder Jo Sakai, founder of the Yamato Colony, was born October 7, 1874 in the castle town of Miyazu, Japan. Given the name Kamosu, he was the fourth of seven children born into a former samurai household. He traveled to the United States in 1895 upon completing the equivalent of a high school education in Japan. After visiting Florida in 1903, he returned to Japan early the following year to recruit settlers and investors for his colony project. He finally established the Yamato Colony on a permanent site early in the summer of 1905. He promoted the colony effort tirelessly throughout the remainder of his life. On August 21, 1923 he died of tuberculosis in Asheville, North Carolina, where he had gone to retire. He was 49 years old. Nothing Less than the Transformation of Florida Agriculture Florida business and political leaders supported Sakai’s plan for a Japanese colony because they believed that the project would introduce new crops and farming techniques to the state. They expected the Yamato Colony to provide a model that farmers could emulate to improve the profitability of Florida agriculture. In the decades since the Civil War had devastated the South’s economy, agricultural interests experimented with Japanese crops to help revitalize the region. It was only natural that the assistance of the Japanese themselves would eventually be sought in such ventures. The Colony Site The Japanese colony was established in early summer of 1905 on lands previously occupied by an enterprise called the Keystone Plantation. It was located in the tiny community then known as Wyman, situated midway between Delray Beach and Boca Raton. Access to the plantation, and later the colony, was available from Dixie Highway by a primitive railroad crossing at what has since become known as Yamato Road. Plantation lands extended north and south of the future road about one mile in either direction. The western boundary of the property was in the vicinity of present-day Interstate 95. The colonists soon built homes on the property, west and south of the crossing into the colony land. Later a railroad station and a school were established nearby. Part II – Diary of a Colony Diary of Henry Tamemasu Kamiya Henry Kamiya kept a diary from June 1, 1914 to June 25, 1941. He began it some ten years after his arrival in the Boca Raton area, and continued it until just before he left south Florida to join the family of his eldest daughter in California. Entries are typically terse, but give a brief glimpse of the kind of life he led in Yamato. One of the most dramatic events to be recorded in the diary occurs on its first page, when fire swept through the Kamiya family home on June 3, 1914. Daily Life in a Small Florida Town Yamato was principally a farming community, with a few of the settlers branching out into other commercial endeavors. Leisure activities included family and community gatherings like shooting pool, playing hanafuda (a card game), and making ice cream at one of the settlers’ homes. Japanese influence on the lives of the settlers was slight. Meals were a combination of Japanese and American fare. The Japanese language was spoken at home only by the adults. Only one of the homes had a Japanese-style bath. Japanese annual events were ignored or were pale shadows of observances in Japan. One Woman’s Story The first woman known to have traveled from Japan to join the Yamato Colony was Sada Sakai, wife of the colony founder. Theirs was an arranged marriage, the wedding taking place within weeks of Jo Sakai’s return to Japan early in 1907, when the two met face-to-face for the first time. Several of the marriages of colony settlers occurred in the same manner. Sada Sakai later confided to her daughters that, on first meeting, their father did not quite match her image of the ideal mate. Furthermore, she had no desire to leave Japan, but her brother convinced her to accept Sakai’s offer of marriage. Arriving in Florida, she found the colony a disappointment after Sakai had apparently described it as larger and more settled. Young Americans By the end of the first decade of the century, families were growing in Yamato, but only with difficulty. The first child born in the colony, Jo Sakai’s son Hiroshi, died before the age of two, and the only family known to have joined the settlement, that of F. Tahara, his French-born wife Claire, and their two children, did not remain for long. Other children, however, soon followed. At last, it seemed as if Sakai’s hope for a stable community would be realized. In fact, Yamato families were hardly more likely to remain rooted than its single men. Of the seven Japanese families known to have resided in Yamato, only two stayed long enough for children to reach adulthood. Part III – George Sukeji Morikami In many ways George Sukeji Morikami was typical of the settlers recruited by Yamato’s organizers. He joined the colony at a young age, was unmarried, and did not plan to remain in South Florida for more than a few years. Far from Jo Sakai’s ideal, this profile held little promise for the long-term stability of the colony. Paradoxically, Morikami would become the last of the original colonists to remain in Palm Beach County. Ultimately, his is the classic immigrant’s story — an ambitious young man seeking opportunity travels to America to make a better life for himself. Through hard work and ingenuity George Morikami found prosperity here, achieving a personal worth in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. Despite this, he was a man of simple tastes for whom the trappings of wealth meant little. He preferred to live out his life simply, finding pleasure in his closeness to nature. Toward the end, he lived reclusively in a mobile home on land he had purchased in the closing days of World War II —land that would become Morikami Park. A Timeless Gift George Morikami acquired much of the land that would become Morikami Park in the closing days of World War II. Almost 20 years later, he began what would become a 10-year campaign to give the land away, first to the city of Delray Beach and later to Palm Beach County. The county finally accepted the elderly farmer’s generous gift in 1973. Part IV – The Diminishing South Florida Community Although property was still owned by some former residents, only three Japanese households existed in the Yamato area by the early 1940s. The dream of a noble experiment that would revolutionize Florida’s agriculture had long been forgotten. As the United States went to war with Japan, Federal Judge John W. Holland signed the order that emphatically ended Yamato’s existence. His action awarded immediate possession of nearly 6,000 acres in the Yamato area to the federal government for creating an Army Air Corps technical training facility. Neighbors of the Japanese The Yamato area was previously called Wyman, home to the families of other settlers before the arrival of the Japanese. These families remained in the area as neighbors of the colonists, their children attending school at the one-room Yamato schoolhouse and playing with the children of the Japanese. By the 1920s, a community of Bahamian immigrants had also grown up adjacent to the Japanese colony. During the war years, the Bahamian neighbors of the few remaining Japanese were moved, at government expense, houses and all, to Delray Beach, where they formed a new neighborhood still called New Town today. The Spanish River Papers The Boca Raton Historical Society has reprinted historical newspaper articles and published original correspondence from Jo Sakai and others on the founding of the Yamato Colony in The Spanish River Papers, Volume VII, no. 2 and Volume VI, no. 1. To read these newspaper articles, please click here. Our Founder: George Morikami Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens celebrate a more than century-old connection between Japan and South Florida. In the early 1900s, a group of young Japanese farmers arrived in what is now northern Boca Raton and formed an agricultural colony they called Yamato, an ancient name for Japan. The colony’s farming endeavors were ultimately unsustainable. Consequently, almost all original colony members returned to Japan. In the mid-1970s, one of the last remaining settlers, George Sukeji Morikami, then in his 80s, donated his land to Palm Beach County with the wish for it to become a park to preserve the memory of the Yamato Colony. Together with his friends, neighbors, and the Palm Beach County Department of Parks and Recreation, George’s simple dream took on a new dimension. With the opening of the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in 1977, a living monument was created, building a bridge of cultural understanding between George Morikami’s two homelands. 65.4k Followers Facebook 10.9k Followers X (formerly Twitter) 42.5k Followers Instagram 119k Total fans Hours Museum & Gardens Tues – Sun: 10am – 5pm Cornell Café Tues – Sun: 11am – 3pm Closed Mondays and major holidays Admission Adults (18+): $16 Seniors (65+): $14 Students (with ID) $12 Military (with ID) $14 Children (6-17): $10 Morikami Members: FREE!

Morikami Book Club 2024-2025 Selection June 11 – Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation: By Michael Zielenziger The world’s second-wealthiest country, Japan once seemed poised to overtake America as the leading global economic powerhouse. But the country failed to recover from the staggering economic collapse of the early 1990s. Today it confronts an array of disturbing social trends, notably a population of more than one million hikikomori: the young men who shut themselves in their rooms, withdrawing from society. There is also a growing number of “parasite singles”: single women who refuse to leave home, marry, or bear children. In this trenchant investigation, Michael Zielenziger argues that Japan’s tradition-steeped society, its aversion to change, and its distrust of individuality are stifling economic revival, political reform, and social evolution. Shutting Out the Sun is a bold explanation of Japan’s stagnation and its implications for the rest of the world. Morikami Book Club 2025-2026 Selection October 8 – Inheritors. By:  Aako Serizawa A kaleidoscopic portrait of five generations scattered across Asia and the United States, Inheritors is a heartbreakingly beautiful and brutal exploration of a Japanese family fragmented by the Pacific side of World War II. A retired doctor is forced to confront the moral consequences of his wartime actions. His brother’s wife, compelled to speak of a fifty-year-old murder, reveals the shattering realities of life in Occupied Japan. Half a century later, her estranged American granddaughter winds her way back East, pursuing her absent father’s secrets. Decades into the future, two siblings face the consequences of their great-grandparents’ war as the world shimmers on the brink of an even more pervasive violence. Grappling with the legacies of loss, imperialism, and war, Inheritors offers an intricate tapestry of stories illuminating the complex ways in which we live, interpret, and pass on our tangled histories. November 12  – The Ghost of Honolulu: A Japanese Spy, a Japanese American Spy Hunter and an untold Story of Pearl Harbor.   By: Mark Harmon A U.S. naval counterintelligence officer working to safeguard Pearl Harbor; a Japanese spy ordered to Hawaii to gather information on the American fleet. On December 7, 1941, their hidden stories are exposed by a morning of bloodshed that would change the world forever. Scrutinizing long-buried historical documents, NCIS star Mark Harmon and co-author Leon Carroll, a former NCIS Special Agent, have brought forth a true-life NCIS story of deception, discovery, and danger. Hawaii, 1941. War clouds with Japan are gathering and the islands of Hawaii have become battlegrounds of spies, intelligence agents, and military officials – with the island’s residents caught between them. Toiling in the shadows are Douglas Wada, the only Japanese American agent in naval intelligence, and Takeo Yoshikawa, a Japanese spy sent to Pearl Harbor to gather information on the U.S. fleet.       Douglas Wada’s experiences in his native Honolulu include posing undercover as a newspaper reporter, translating wiretaps on the Japanese Consulate, and interrogating America’s first captured POW of World War II, a submarine officer found on the beach. Takeo Yoshikawa is a Japanese spy operating as a junior diplomat with the consulate who is collecting vital information that goes straight to Admiral Yamamoto. Their dueling stories anchor Ghosts of Honolulu’s gripping depiction of the world-changing cat and mouse games played between Japanese and US military intelligence agents (and a mercenary Nazi) in Hawaii before the outbreak of the second world war. Also caught in the upheaval are Honolulu’s innocent residents – including Douglas Wada’s father – who endure the war’s anti-Japanese fervor and a cadre of intelligence professionals who must prevent Hawaii from adopting the same destructive mass internments as California. December 10 – Japanese Death Poems; Written by Zen Monks and Haiku Poets “A wonderful introduction the Japanese tradition of jisei , this volume is crammed with exquisite, spontaneous verse and pithy, often hilarious, descriptions of the eccentric and committed monastics who wrote the poems.” — Tricycle: The Buddhist Review Although the consciousness of death is, in most cultures, very much a part of life, this is perhaps nowhere more true than in Japan, where the approach of death has given rise to a centuries-old tradition of writing jisei , or the “death poem.” Such a poem is often written in the very last moments of the poet’s life. Hundreds of Japanese death poems, many with a commentary describing the circumstances of the poet’s death, have been translated into English here, the vast majority of them for the first time. Compiler Yoel Hoffmann explores the attitudes and customs surrounding death in historical and present-day Japan and gives examples of how these have been reflected in the nation’s literature in general. The development of writing jisei is then examined—from the longing poems of the early nobility and the more “masculine” verses of the samurai to the satirical death poems of later centuries. January 14 –  Fish Swimming in Dappled Sunlight. By: Riku Onda – Translated by: Alison Watts Set in Tokyo over the course of one night, Aki and Hiro have decided to be together one last time in their shared flat before parting. Their relationship has broken down after a mountain trek during which their guide died inexplicably. Now each believes the other to be a murderer and is determined to extract a confession before the night is over. Who is the murderer and what really happened on the mountain?    In the battle of will between them, the chain of events leading up to this night is gradually revealed in a gripping psychological thriller that keeps the reader in suspense to the very end. February 11 – The Lady and the Monk.  By:  Pico Iyer When Pico Iyer decided to go to Kyoto and live in a monastery, he did so to learn about Zen Buddhism from the inside, to get to know Kyoto, one of the loveliest old cities in the world, and to find out something about Japanese culture today—not the world of businessmen and production lines, but the traditional world of changing seasons and the silence of temples, of the images woven through literature, of the lunar Japan that still lives on behind the rising sun of geopolitical power. All this he did. And then he met Sachiko.  Vivacious, attractive, thoroughly educated, speaking English enthusiastically if eccentrically, the wife of a Japanese “salaryman” who seldom left the office before 10 PM, Sachiko was as conversant with tea ceremony and classical Japanese literature as with rock music, Goethe, and Vivaldi. With the lightness of touch that made Video Night in Kathmandu so captivating, Pico Iyer fashions from their relationship a marvelously ironic yet heartfelt book that is at once a portrait of cross-cultural infatuation—and misunderstanding—and a delightfully fresh way of seeing both the old Japan and the very new. March 11 – Butter.  By: Asuko Yusuki The cult Japanese bestseller about a female gourmet cook and serial killer, and the journalist intent on cracking her case, inspired by a true story Gourmet cook Manako Kajii sits in the Tokyo Detention House convicted of the serial murders of lonely businessmen, whom she is said to have seduced with her delicious home cooking. The case has captured the nation’s imagination, but Kajii refuses to speak with the press, entertaining no visitors. That is until journalist Rika Machida writes a letter asking for her recipe for beef stew, and Kajii can’t resist writing back. Rika, the only woman in her news office, works late each night, rarely cooking more than ramen. As the visits unfold between her and the steely Kajii, they are closer to a master class in food than journalistic research. Rika hopes this gastronomic exchange will help her soften Kajii, but it seems that Rika might be the one changing. With each meal she eats, something is awakening in her body. Do she and Kajii have more in common than she once thought?    Inspired by the real case of a convicted con woman and serial killer—the “Konkatsu Killer”—Asako Yuzuki’s Butter is a vivid, unsettling exploration of misogyny, obsession, romance, and the transgressive pleasures of food in Japan. April 8 – At Home in Japan.  By:  Rebecca Otowa What would it be like to move to Japan, leaving everyone you know behind, to become part of a traditional Japanese household? At Home in Japan tells an extraordinary true story of a foreign woman who goes through a fantastic transformation, as she makes a move from a suburban lifestyle in California to a new life, living in Japan. She dedicates 30 years of her life to being a housewife, custodian and chatelaine of a 350-year-old farmhouse in rural Japan. This astonishing book traces a circular path from were Rebecca began, to living under Japanese customs—from the essential day to day details of life in the house and village, through relationships with family, neighbors and the natural and supernatural entities with which the family shares the home. Rebecca Otowa then focuses on her inner life, touching on some of the pivotal memories of her time in Japan, the lessons in perception that Japan has taught her and how she has been changed by living in Japan. May 8  –  Author Zack Davison will lecture on: Yokai Japanese Supernatural Creatures at 7:00PM in the auditorium. This lecture will complement the new exhibition Yokai: Scenes of the Supernatural in Japanese Woodblock Prints opening on May 9 th , 2026. Get your lecture tickets in advance online. May 13 – No Longer Human. By: Osamu Dazai “Mine has been a life of shame. I can’t even guess what it must be to live the life of a human being.” Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai’s NO LONGER HUMAN narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels incapable of understanding human beings. His attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a “clown” to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness. Still one of the ten bestselling books in Japan, NO LONGER HUMAN is an important and unforgettable modern classic. June 10 – The Forest of Wool and Steel.  By: Natsu Miyashita Tomura is startled by the hypnotic sound of a piano being tuned in his school. It seeps into his soul and transports him to the forests, dark and gleaming, that surround his beloved mountain village. From that moment, he is determined to discover more. Under the tutelage of three master piano-tuners – one humble, one cheery, one ill-tempered – Tomura embarks on his training, never straying too far from a single, unfathomable question: do I have what it takes? Set in small-town Japan, this warm and mystical story is for the lucky few who have found their calling – and for the rest of us who are still searching. It shows that the road to finding one’s purpose is a winding path, often filled with treacherous doubts and, for those who persevere, astonishing moments of revelation.

Galleries Ceremony Spaces Indoor Receptions Outdoor Receptions Garden Photo Shoots Rental Guidelines The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens provide a beautiful and unique setting for social events.   It is important that lessees and their suppliers demonstrate a willingness to respect the sensitivity of the Museum, Gardens, and surroundings.  Failure to do so may result in fines and/or suspension of the rights to provide services at the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens. The Museum is open to the public from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. every day except Monday. This presents some challenges with regard to set-up times.  Staff at the Morikami recognize this and will work with outside contractors to help ensure a smooth set-up within the allotted times.  These guidelines are designed to answer frequent questions and to help avoid any last-minute logistical issues.  Topics are listed in alphabetical order. Access, Set-up and Clean-up Times Each Facility Use Agreement states the scheduled set-up time, event timing, and breakdown period.  Usual timings are: Set-up: 5:00 p.m. – 6:30 p.m. Event: 6:30 p.m. – Midnight Breakdown/cleanup: Midnight – 1:30 a.m. Any agreement outside these times must be written into the contract before signing.  A charge of $500.00 per hour or part hour will be charged for events running later than the stated times. Subcontracted caterers, decorators, and lighting companies should be aware that contracts allow 1½ hours for breakdown (usual deadline is 1:30 a.m.)  It is essential that sufficient staff be assigned to both remove equipment and complete any necessary clean-up.  Lessee is liable for an over run fee of $500.00 per hour or part hour if the area is not cleared on time. Bird Seed , Bubbles, Confetti, Flower Petals, Flying Lanterns and Sparklers Bird seed and confetti are not allowed. Bubbles are allowed outside the museum, but excess liquid must not be poured into the lake, flower beds or grass. The use of any other objects must be pre-approved by facility rental staff. Candles All candles must be in a candleholder of the appropriate size, encompassing the entire candle. Open flames, such as taper candles, may not be used in decorations.  Tea-lights are not recommended because of their limited burn time.  In cases where there are too many candles inside the lobby, the fire alarm may be triggered, at which point everyone must evacuate the building and the fire department will be called. Catering All catering arrangements must be coordinated through our on-site caterer, The Cornell Café.  The Cornell Café reserves the right to subcontract an outside catering company of their choice to cater an event with completely kosher requirements. They are able to provide kosher style cuisine, but do not have a kosher kitchen. All parties planning an event at the Morikami must have their initial meeting with The Cornell Café and Morikami Facility Rental staff to determine how we can best meet the needs of the interested party. Subcontracted catering companies selected by The Cornell Café and approved by The Morikami, Inc. will have access to an area on the west side of the Museum that has been designated as a staging area.  Cook tents and other necessary supplies may be set up in this area with approval from The Cornell Cafe and Morikami Facility Rental staff. Water and a power supply are available. The Cornell Café tables and chairs may not be moved from the Café area.  Subcontracted caterers will not have access to the on-site kitchen. A $25.00 per person surcharge applies to events with subcontracted catering. Children A room with a television and DVD player is available to occupy young children.  Lessee or caterer must undertake cleaning of the room following the event.  In the interest of safety, children should not play near the lake or waterfall and should not be allowed to throw stones or other items in the water. They must also respect the plants growing around the terrace.  Please ensure that children are not playing on the stairs or handrails or running throughout the event spaces. An adult must be present to supervise children at all times. Clean-up Catering staff is responsible for clean up during and after the event.  Caterers must notify The Morikami Inc. staff before leaving the facility so that area can be inspected.  Caterers must provide all cleaning supplies and personnel.  Cleaners containing bleach, ammonia, acid or butyl may not be used in the Museum.  All debris must be cleared and hauled away or deposited in a designated Museum dumpster.  All other vendors are responsible for cleaning up any décor or items they provide. Dance Floor A wooden dance floor is not allowed in the lobby area, but may be set-up on the cemented terraces. Decorations, Fixtures, and Furniture All decorations must be free standing; nothing may be attached to the Museum walls or ceilings.  Existing light bulbs may not be changed. No existing fixture may be moved without prior approval from the Facility Rental Department.  All vendors or persons who supply any décor are responsible for the removal and clean-up of those items. $200.00 may be retained from the security deposit if this rule is not observed. This includes the removal of tape and floral petals from the terraces and ceremony site. Deliveries All equipment should be delivered to the west side loading dock.  We have limited storage but, subject to prior arrangements, deliveries may be made up to 24 hours prior to an event.  The lessee or a designated representative should be available on the premises to sign for deliveries.  Museum personnel may sign for deliveries but will not be responsible for the accuracy of the delivery. No equipment should be unloaded at the front entrance of the Museum.  The driveway in front of the Museum is a fire lane and no parking is allowed at any time.  All rental equipment must be moved to the designated storage area for collection the following day. The Morikami is not responsible for loss, theft, or damage to rental equipment. Disturbances In the event of a disturbance or unacceptable behavior, the Morikami Event Coordinator reserves the right to ask a guest to leave, terminate the event, or, if necessary, call the police. Dressing Rooms Two dressing rooms may be available for use after 3:00 p.m. on the day of the event unless otherwise specified in the Facility Use Agreement. Please note that the Museum Theater is in use until 5:00 p.m. and any excessive noise backstage will be heard in the Theater.  A dressing room key is available upon request so that you may lock the rooms. The Morikami, Inc. may retain $250.00 from the security deposit if the key is not returned upon conclusion of the event. Electrical/Power Supply A list of outlets is available upon request.  Each outlet is 20 AMPs/120 volts. All wires and extension cords must be securely taped down.  Use of duct tape is not permitted. The Museum’s slate tile floors are sensitive to many brands of tape; removal of tape must not strip finish of the Museum tile floors. We recommend regular electrician’s tape. Favors and Gifts The Morikami Museum Shop can provide gift and favor suggestions and offers a 15% discount on all purchases from contract signing to the date of the event.  Please call the store at 561.233.1344. Fire All fire exits are clearly marked.  In the event of a fire, the building must be evacuated immediately using the nearest exit.  The Morikami Event Coordinator will issue appropriate instructions for all emergencies. Fireworks Only fireworks with at least 45 days notice and the necessary County and Fire Department permits will be considered for approval from the Parks and Recreation Department. Fireworks can take place no later than 9:00 p.m. unless given prior written approval by the Morikami, Inc. and the Parks and Recreation Department. The Morikami will only consider allowing a firework display mounted by one of its preferred fireworks vendors. Galleries The Museum Galleries are not normally open during private rentals.  An additional security fee of $250.00 may be paid to have the galleries remain open. If this has been paid and the Galleries are available for viewing, please note that no food or drink is allowed inside. Even small crumbs of food could attract pests that can cause serious damage to the items on display. Drop tables must be placed at the entrance for glasses and plates.  Museum docents may be requested at the rate of $50.00 each. At least one docent is required if the Galleries are open. Hotels The Morikami has negotiated special discounted rates at local hotels in the Delray Beach / Boca Raton area. Insurance The Morikami requires that all vendors carry minimum general liability insurance of $1,000,000.  Proof of insurance may be requested from any vendor before allowing them to perform services at the Morikami Museum.  The Morikami, Inc. and Palm Beach County may require that they be added as an additional insured to a vendor’s policy, in which case the Facility Rental Staff will notify you of this requirement if it applies to your event. Lighting The Morikami does have architectural lighting on the main Museum building in addition to lighting on all of the terrace stairs. There is minimal lighting around the terraces, Morikami Falls, and on the footpath between the Woodruff Bridge and the tent slab.  Please reference the preferred vendor listing for lighting contractors who are able to provide more extensive lighting packages, which may feature lake lighting, lanterns, and patterned or colored lighting effects. Medical Emergencies A defibrillator is available on the premises, together with standard first aid supplies. Music and Entertainment There are no restrictions on music or entertainment, however, a band with more than four / five performers will restrict the capacity of the lobby.  Bands may require tenting of their performance area if outdoors. Tenting, staging installation, and permitting of such items are the financial responsibility of the lessee, and logistical arrangements must be confirmed with the Facility Rental Department well in advance of the event. Parking and Valet All guests should park in the Museum car parking area.  A valet service (hired at the expense of the lessee) is required to staff specific locations if guests will be entering through the staff parking lot gate. The Morikami is not responsible for providing a covering for the trash dumpster enclosure in that area. Photography The facility rental fee includes use of the Gardens for formal wedding portraits beginning at 3:00 p.m. on the event date. Pre-Event Meeting It is important for the success of the event to schedule a walk-through with the Morikami staff at least three weeks prior to the event.  Ideally the lessee, together with all contractors involved in the event (planner, caterer, decorator, lighting technician, entertainers, etc.) should be present. The proposed timetable and layout of the event must be submitted so that any potential problems are discussed and resolved prior to the day of the event.  The Morikami must approve final floor plans and electrical needs at least two weeks prior to the event.

Roughly 2,000 sq. foot building at the heart of the gardens, has stood as a symbol of Japanese culture and architecture. Loosely based on the famous 17th century Katsura Imperial Villa-still existing in all its splendor in Kyoto, Japan. The detached royal residence is known for its careful balance of proportions and all-natural materials, which are key to the overall aesthetics of the buildings and picturesque gardens associated with Japan. Yamato was the name of the original village of Japanese settlers who farmed a large area of land in Boca Raton starting in 1904. The word means, “great peace,” and the early immigrants felt it an appropriate name for their new home. “Kan,” means building and is often seen as a suffix to place names in modern Japan. Inside, guests find two short documentaries ranging in length from five to 15 minutes.  These videos highlight the stories of the Yamato colonists, and Hoichi Kurisu – the Japanese landscape garden designer. Another feature allows visitors to explore some of the recently digitized materials from the Museum Archive collection associated with the original founders, their families, friends, neighbors, some local newspaper clipping, and excerpts from Tamemasu ‘Henry’ Kamiya’s diary from over 100 years ago. The Yamato Colony Pioneering Japanese in Florida Discover the history of our founder, George Morikami, and the community of pioneering immigrants that once settled in Palm Beach County.

The book will be available at the museum store (limited supplies while they last) Listening to Trees: George Nakashima, Woodworker , by Holly Thompson, illustrated by Toshiki Nakamura (Neal Porter Books, Holiday House, 2024) is a poetic and moving picture book biography celebrating the life and work of the visionary Japanese American woodworker George Nakashima. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, George Nakashima began a love story with trees that grew throughout his remarkable life as architect, designer and woodworker. During World War II, George, with his wife Marion and their baby daughter, endured incarceration in Minidoka prison camp, where he drew comfort from the discipline of woodworking. Once free, George dedicated the rest of his life to crafting furniture from fallen or discarded trees, giving fresh purpose and dignity to each tree, and promoting a more peaceful world. Author Holly Thompson narrates Nakashima’s life using haibun, a combination of haiku and prose, which twines smoothly through Toshiki Nakamura’s earthy illustrations. A foreword by Nakashima’s daughter Mira and robust history at the end of the book will deepen young readers’ understanding of woodworking and poetry and offer added insights to the work of a master artisan.
