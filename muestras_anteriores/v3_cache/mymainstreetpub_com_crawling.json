We’re here to help, both now, and when your business needs to innovate, remake itself, change owners, or process generational transitions in family leadership. We’re here to help you. We define traditional businesses as mainstay businesses: dry cleaners, auto parts supply stores, gas stations, HVAC companies, plumbers, and electricians. Even some manufacturing facilities fall into the traditional business category. You know these companies. They live where you live. It’s the plumber two streets over who hung out his shingle in 1978; the dry cleaner down the block that now has second generation ownership; the manufacturer near the highway exit that has had a steady work force of fifty-five employees for three decades. Traditional businesses have stood the test of time, been bastions of the community, and are—in most cases—doing business in the same way they always have. You see, for most traditional businesses, each year is pretty much a repeat of the previous year. With so much sameness, you can see how it’s easy to get lulled into a comforting routine. jamie gerdsen Jamie Gerdsen has become the spokesman for that mainstay of the U.S. economy–the traditional business. As CEO of Apollo Home, Jamie completely changed the culture of his company, resulting in growth in customers served, and employees hired. A noted speaker, Jamie is active in leadership positions within the Young Presidents’ Organization, is in demand on service boards, and has been part of Forty Under 40, and Leadership Cincinnati. books The thing about zombies is you don’t know them when you see them. They’re invisible; but don’t be fooled. As they walk unnoticed through the halls of your small business, they’re doing a number—a negative number—on your bottom line. They slow productivity, treat your customers rudely, and infect other employees with their poor morale and shoddy work ethic. In a small business, one zombie—one employee not pulling his or her share of the workload—can make all the difference. So dive in and learn more on how to handle them Leading change is hard. Leading change in a traditional industry can seem impossible. Jamie Gerdsen presents hard-learned lessons for inspiring innovation in traditional industries, such as manufacturing or his own heating, cooling, and plumbing company. Through personal stories of trial and error and eventual triumph over the roadblocks to change, you’ll discover how to embrace and foster innovation in your own organization. Discussions include hiring, employee motivation, professional focus, coaching, the business cycle, and work-life balance. staff Peter Winick Chief Operating Officer Peter Winick makes everything at Main Street Leadership work. He is a maestro of results driven by practical strategy and focused execution. He expertly leverages over twenty years’ experience with such clients as IBM, Kraft, Microsoft, Avon, Hyatt and more.

The project's goal was to partner with Town residents, business owners, and developers to define what the community wanted to see on five different sites in Downtown Parker and what was feasible for the private market to develop. Updates In 2022, the Parker Town Council and P3 Board of Directors approved a development agreement with Confluence Companies to develop six publicly owned parcels. In February 2025, Confluence gave a presentation to the Parker Town Council showing updated site plans and renderings.

These interactions helped shape the future of the downtown vision and guided future investments in the space. At the end of the project, P3 was armed with a set of guidelines for developing four different sites in Downtown Parker.
