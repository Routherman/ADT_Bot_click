Admission can be paid separately online or in the Welcome Center! Join us for a fun, guided adventure at the Wonder Gardens. You will be able to connect with our Sulcata tortoises and Rainbow lorikeets in their habitats and offer enrichment through feeding, and/or brushing experiences! (activity selection is at the discretion of our Animal Care team in response to animal needs and wellbeing) Encounters last approximately 45 minutes. Please check in at least 15 minutes before your scheduled encounter. Wild Wonders Encounters take place on select days at 11:30 AM . All encounters must have a minimum of 2 participants and a MAXIMUM of 6 participants. We want everyone to enjoy the fun, so if your party has fewer than 6, we may add other paid participants to the group. Please book ahead of time. Our slots fill up fast. If you have any questions, please email [email protected] . Please read before booking- *Encounter Description* During the Wild Wonder Animal Encounter, we’ll meet and feed Sulcata tortoises and Rainbow and Coconut lorikeets in their Wonder Gardens habitats. The encounter guide will introduce you to our animal residents and provide information about safety and feeding techniques to ensure a great experience for both you and our animals.  Sulcata tortoises are the third largest tortoise species in the world and males can grow to be about 200 pounds.  When we encounter the tortoises, we will walk through crushed shell mulch to a 2-foot-wide gate and step over an 18-inch fence onto the natural-earth habitat where the tortoises freely roam. We will hold tongs to feed them fresh vegetables, stooping low to provide the feeding on their level. Closed toe shoes are required to protect participants’ feet. The tortoises will approach participants to eat, and participants may touch them lightly on their backs and take photos with them while feeding.  Next, we’ll walk the brick pathway to the lorikeet habitat, and learn more about these beautiful birds and the techniques to feed and interact with them. All loose jewelry such as hoop earrings, bracelets, and necklaces must be removed or tucked into clothing before entering. The habitat has a double door for the birds’ safety, so all participants will enter a small receiving area together before we move to the larger habitat. As we calmly enter, we’ll hear their piercing calls, chortles, and coos, and we will hold out a cup of nectar for them to drink. The experience includes the potential for birds to land on guests’ arms, shoulders, and head. During landings, the claws and beaks of the birds may be felt on the skin. In some cases, these landings may leave temporary marks or (rarely) pierce the skin.  It’s fun to watch the lorikeets shake their heads as they feed, and many guests prefer to wear clothing that can take the drops of brown nectar. As the encounter wraps up, participants are encouraged to wipe hands well with a wet wipe, use hand sanitizer, and enjoy the rest of their day at Wonder Gardens. If you have any questions or would like to request accommodations, please contact us at [email protected] Your browser must support JavaScript in order to make a booking.

Our Story Our Tribe Careers Reviews Let's Talk About You! News & Marketing Tips FAQ Fridays Let's Connect Let's Connect April 8, 2024 The Wonder Gardens solidifies partnership with the City of Bonita Springs Agreement ensures the future of the longtime attraction The City of Bonita Springs has approved a renewable public-private partnership operating agreement with the Wonder Gardens for a period of 10 years. The agreement was approved after a second reading at the City of Bonita Springs Council meeting on April 3. “The City is happy to have reached a comprehensive agreement for such a staple in downtown Bonita Springs. The Wonder Gardens is reminiscent of Old Florida, giving a connection to the past for our community. Finalizing the agreement is icing on the cake and a great way to celebrate the city’s upcoming 25 th anniversary!” said Mayor Rick Steinmeyer. In the agreement, signed by the Bonita Springs City Council, the Wonder Gardens will pay the city $50,000 a year in rent and provide capital improvements of $3 million or more over the 10-year term. Additionally, any naming rights, subleases and property improvements will require City approval. “This has been a long time coming for all parties involved and I am very proud of the end result,” said Councilman Jesse Purdon. “As we charge into a brand-new day with the Wonder Gardens, things have never looked or felt so good for the greatest city in America.” “We are grateful to the city officials and the City Council who have taken the time to work out this agreement,” said Dr. Wendy Arsenault, chair of the Wonder Gardens board. “As a Bonita Springs resident and previous business owner, I understand the value of the Wonder Gardens for the City and the citizens, providing education and delight while drawing others into our community. As a veterinarian, I am pleased with the changes that have been made in the last several years to make the attraction a topnotch zoo facility and look forward to the future.” The agreement solidifies a strong partnership between the Wonder Gardens, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and the City of Bonita Springs, which owns the 3.5 acres that house the historic attraction. “We’re so pleased to continue our relationship and collaboration with the City of Bonita Springs, and welcome the vision and commitment to honoring the Wonder Garden’s legacy as an iconic representation of Old Florida at its best, while ensuring its relevancy and sustainability as a beloved community institution in the heart of Bonita Springs,” said Neil Anderson, president and CEO of the nonprofit that runs the Wonder Gardens. “The support of the City allows us to update and expand the Wonder Gardens experience while continuing what makes the Wonder Gardens so special. With the City’s collaboration, we look forward to enhancing all that makes the Wonder Gardens a beloved community treasure that represents a link to the rich, cultural legacy of Bonita Springs.” In April 2015, a group of citizens created the nonprofit Bonita Wonder Gardens, Inc. and contracted to purchase the attraction, which has a storied history dating back to 1936, to save it from potential commercial development. When the group was unable to raise sufficient funds to secure the acquisition, the City provided $3 million, secured by a mortgage. In January 2018, when the nonprofit was unable to repay the mortgage, the City took title to the land. The new public-private partnership operating agreement allows the City and the Wonder Gardens to look forward to the community attraction’s next chapter, including pursuing accreditation from the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and developing a master plan for new exhibits and improvements. In 1936, the Piper family established The Reptile Gardens as a roadside attraction along the newly built Tamiami Trail from Tampa to Miami. As the animal and botanical exhibits grew, the attraction’s name was changed to Everglades Wonder Gardens to better reflect the experience available to guests. Share now!

Located on Old 41 Road in Bonita Springs, the cultural icon and designated historic site is one of the few remaining cornerstones of Old Florida. Several years ago, the City of Bonita Springs took over ownership of the property, which is under the stewardship of a not-for-profit. Previously, the Piper family owned the attraction. The Wonder Gardens has a deep-rooted past and so does its new executive director, David Rahahe:tih Webb, who was ap­pointed this fall. “Growing up we had 22 acres off Corkscrew with horses and cows,” said Webb. “I grew up playing in the woods here, and there is little of that left. I feel like this is a good place for me to be, to leverage the historical side of the Wonder Gardens, the environmental side, and help convey the importance of conservation and keeping these Old Florida places alive.” Artist’s rendering of the planned Parrots and Parasols Courtyard Webb is an eighth-generation Floridian. His Native American name, Rahahe:tih, translates to “he makes the road.” His career has been cen­tered on the environment and conservation. With a degree in environmental studies from FGCU, Webb has taught science at Fort Myers High School. He has served as a naturalist at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, and education manager of the Naples Botanical Garden, among other positions. “For me, coming here is definitely coming home.” said Webb. The not-for-profit cares for more than 300 animals. Many are former pets or cannot be released into the wild and now have a forever home at the Wonder Gardens. Webb said he believes in the values of inclusion among staff members and an emphasis on community connections. “There’s been a lot of excitement about the new direction of things,” said Webb and board member Marjorie Rubacky agrees. “He has worked a miracle,” said Rubacky. “He’s brought not only creativity to the Gardens but he has managed to motivate the staff to work together as a true team making it all happen. He’s brought a new spirit which has motivated everybody. He’s an outstanding person.” Indian blue peafowl (Pavo cristatus), also known as blue peacock (Photo by Kat Velez) By January, the Wonder Gardens will welcome visitors with a new Lightner Parrots and Parasols Courtyard: a beautiful open display of exotic birds perched under colorful umbrellas at the entrance to the grounds. The William and Judith Turner Eagle Aviary, Oberweis Golden Pheasant Pavilion, and crocodile exhibit will also be complete, pending the timely arrival of the crocodiles. The old butterfly enclosure is being converted to the Ernie and Sandie Schaub Ornamental Duck Pavilion. The Schaubs also sponsored a small aviary for rescued cockatiels, parakeets, and finches. African Grey parrot and Amazon parrot aviaries are under construc­tion, and a major conversion of the turtle pond to a koi pond will include new waterfall features and an upgraded filtration system. The rare white peacock. White peacocks are the result of a genetic mutation called leucism, which causes pigment not to stick to their feathers. (Photo by Kat Velez) William and Judith Turner have generously offered a $10,000 match towards the Sun and Scales initiative to renovate the reptile house, which is in dire need. It will take at least $50,000 to build an exhibit for these impressive reptiles, including some albino and rare varieties. “I’m working to keep everything a balance of the Old Florida look and feel while pursuing Association of Zoos and Aquariums accreditation,” said Webb. Accreditation requires the highest standards in animal care and education. Webb stated that $110,000 in pledges have been received for an environmental learning center. The Wonder Gardens is partnering with FGCU and local schools to develop a STEM Institute similar to the one he helped create at the Conservancy. “We just received our first education grant from the Community Foundation of Collier County,” he said. “Lots of things are moving here.” For more information, visit www.evergladeswondergardens.com.
