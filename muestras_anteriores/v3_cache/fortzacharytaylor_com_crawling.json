On the southern edge of Key West, Fort Taylor predates the Civil War and is a National Historic Monument housing the largest cache of Civil War armament in the world. Beyond its historical importance, the park is the southernmost state park in the continental United States. Walk the red-brick corridors of Fort Zachary Taylor, past cannon and gun ports, and history becomes more real than books and photos can depict. One better grasps how soldiers lived as they defended the nation’s southeastern coastline. Tour guides and interpretive panels explain how the fort played important roles in the Civil War and Spanish-American War. History is front and center the third weekend of each month as local re-enactors conduct historic demonstrations. The park also boasts Key West’s favorite beach, located at the southern end of the park, providing opportunities for picnicking, swimming, snorkeling, paddling and fishing. Plan Your Visit Learn Manager's Message Fort Taylor inspires me to share our local history with our community. Everyone on our team of staff rangers and volunteers works together to provide the best experience possible for each guest.
