      "text": "All eyes on Lake Lillian area News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals LOCAL All eyes on Lake Lillian area Nicki Gorny Staff writer Maybe once a week or so, Joshua Hathaway and his daughter, Kelly, can be found ambling around Belleview's Lake Lillian. It's a fairly short drive for the Summerfield family, and Hathaway said the playground equipment there is age-appropriate for 4-year-old Kelly. She also likes to walk the paths and help him fish, he added, and on a recent Friday afternoon tossed bread to the turtles and ducks gathered below the dock. But on a hot day like Friday, when afternoon temperatures crept toward 90 degrees, Hathaway said it would be nice to be able to stop nearby for a drink. That could be in the works, according to city representatives who outline a long-term plan to develop the neighborhood around Lake Lillian. By encouraging businesses to open in nearby homes, some of which are already fall under the mixed commercial-residential zoning that allows such uses, they hope to turn Lake Lillian into the heart of Belleview. “Belleview has a lot to offer,” said Commissioner Gary Ernst. *** Why it matters Belleview city and civic leaders have high hopes for the Lake Lillian area, which they hope to transform into the heart of town. How will they do this? We checked with government officials for the details on zoning, tax-funded projects and overall visioning. *** Bringing Lake Lillian in line with its potential will take “baby steps,” said Ernst, who has been in talks for two years already with Mariah Moody, executive director of the Belleview Economic Development Council. Mayor Christine Dobkowski said less concrete discussions about revitalizing the area predate her time on the City Commission, beginning in 2006, and that long-term revitalization goals at Lake Lillian largely prompted the city to organize a Community Redevelopment Area in 2013. The Community Redevelopment Area, or CRA, earmarks a portion of city and county property taxes collected in “Downtown Belleview” for neighborhood-specific improvements. The CRA is mapped out to cover approximately 225 acres of Belleview, including Lake Lillian and its southern neighborhood, as well as major thoroughfares such as Abshier Boulevard, County Road 484, Baseline Road, County Road 25 and Southeast Hames Road. The CRA fund today totals more than $26,000; no funds have yet been allocated and no projects have yet been outlined. A key part of plans for Lake Lillian's revitalization come today, according to Ernst and Moody, when construction crews from Oelrich Construction Inc. are set to break ground on the city's long-awaited splash park. To be located just a short walk from the lake, near the water tower and old public works building, the nearly $150,000 splash park is expected to draw residents and visitors to the area with its circular design, splash features such as geysers and jets, and an adjacent covered sitting area. Hathaway, for example, said he expects his daughter will love the new splash park. Kelly Durso, an Ocala mother who brought her son to Lake Lillian on Friday, said 2 1/2-year-old Pharaoh also will be a fan. If the neighborhood around Lake Lillian offered cafes, shops or offices, Moody said, splash park visitors like Hathaway or Durso might spend more of their day in Belleview. She and others envision for the neighborhood the sort of attorneys' or doctors' offices that dot Ocala's Historic District, where a home could serve as both a business and a residence. Some local businesses already operate within a few blocks of Lake Lillian, according to Sue Farnsworth, the city's development services director. These include Terry Harris Insurance, for example, or the Belleview Medical Center. Farnsworth said she has had preliminary meetings with at least two other business owners interested in converting part of a home into a spa or office. “We'd really like to see more,” she said. Opening a business is relatively simple for the homes south of Lake Lillian, which Farnsworth said are already zoned for commercial and residential use. Homes north of Lake Lillian are currently zoned residential; depending on how businesses progress on the south side of Lake Lillian, city representatives said, broadening zoning on that side of the lake as well is a long-term possibility. Lake Lillian Park and any businesses to its south also stand to benefit from CRA funds, although through what sort of projects remains to be seen. Dobkowski and Sandi McKamey, city clerk, said the CRA board (which doubles as the City Commission, although the two are separate entities) is waiting for a significant amount of money to build up in the fund before outlining any specific projects. While the city's CRA Plan, written in 2013, proposes multiple projects that address several areas of the CRA, Dobkowski said it is likely that early projects will address Lake Lillian. This could mean improvements to pathways or lighting, she said, or, generally, “things that would make it more desirable, so that business owners will be drawn to it.” The CRA is funded through property taxes, McKamey explained. Any home or business within the CRA pays to the city and county whatever taxes were owed in 2012; any taxes owed in excess of this level, based on inflation or rising property values, for example, go instead to the CRA fund. Lake Lillian Park has already benefited from efforts on the part of the city's public works department. Director Bruce Phillips said his department last year cleaned out the lake, in anticipation of the city's annual fishing derby, and added a dye that both gives the lake a green cast and controls weed and algae growth; it does not harm fish, birds or grass surrounding the lake. Phillips' department also continues to oversee the removal of the lake's resident Muscovy ducks, whose numbers he said are down to fewer than three dozen from an estimated 250 in September. While the ducks are a draw for young visitors such as Kelly and Pharaoh, Phillips said their presence near the splash park would be a health concern. While there is no timeline for revitalization efforts, city officials said they hope to see plans come together within five or 10 years. “It's coming together,” Ernst said.

A man was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound on a public bench near the lake. According to reports, a woman and her mother discovered the body during an everyday walk and immediately alerted authorities. Belleview police responded quickly, covering the scene and securing the area with caution tape. Nearby businesses heard the sound of the gunshot but didn't see anything amiss. What makes this incident particularly troubling is its proximity to a playground, where children were actively playing while the scene was being processed. Identification was made, but they have not yet released the man’s name as the investigation remains ongoing and his family needs to be notified first. We will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available. Read All Hide Comments Calendar No upcoming events.

Belleview City Commission members approved the purchase and demolition of the home on May 16 with a 3-1 vote. A little more than $91,000 was set aside for the entire project. The property itself was purchased for the appraised price of $83,000. The property, dubbed the \"Denker House\" by city officials, sits just west of Lake Lillian. \"It's right dead in the middle of our park,\" Public Works Director Bruce Phillips told the commission during its May 2 meeting. The owner originally asked $114,900 for the property, Phillips said, but later agreed to the appraised price. By Thursday morning, the house had already been reduced to a pile of debris. And a construction crew was moving the debris into a dumpster with the help of a claw excavator. The former two-story wood-framed house had some problem residents, Mayor Christine Dobkowski said. During one discussion, she called the home \"dilapidated and abandoned.\" Commissioner Gary Ernst said he had seen syringes and needles outside the house multiple times. \"It doesn't fit into our master plan,\" he said. The Lake Lillian Park Master Plan is part of Belleview's community redevelopment plan. It includes several improvements, such as replacing footpaths with recreation trails, replacing the electrical system and renovating the old public works department building into a new community center. In February, commissioners approved the hiring of Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. to construct a plan for the park. Plans for the community center were presented to the commission in May. While many commissioners were not adamant proponents of purchasing the Denker house, the only one who voted against it was Commissioner Michael Goldman. \"We are removing a taxable piece of property from the tax rolls,\" he argued May 16. \"We are taking that burden and placing it on the shoulders of everyone else that pays taxes on their property. \"Government,\" he added, \"shouldn't be in the business of purchasing property.\" Commissioner Robert \"Bo\" Smith agreed with Goldman during the many discussions the commission had about the property, but stated he thought it would be well worth it to purchase and demolish the home. Dobkowski said she had reservations about the plans when first approached by Phillips but also thought it would be worth it. She said the green space of the property, instead of problems some residents had posed, would be better for the park and community. \"This is for the benefit of the parks, community,\" Ernst echoed. \"It's for the benefit of the city of Belleview.\" Commissioner Ronald Livsey was not at the meeting when the Denker property purchase was voted on. No public comments by citizens were made at any of the meetings involving discussions of the Denker house. Phillips said after the house is completely removed, city staff will work on cleaning up the property. All the trees will remain, but the undergrowth will be cleaned. The city will next focus on demolishing the old outbuildings in Lake Lillian Park and cleaning up the area around them, Phillips said.
