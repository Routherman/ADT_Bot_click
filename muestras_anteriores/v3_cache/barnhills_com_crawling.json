FLAGLER BEACH, Fla. – Marge and Ted Barnhill are in their 70s and rather than relaxing beachside enjoying retirement, they are getting ready to open a restaurant. This new eatery is Barnhill’s Café, Bar & Grill, which opens mid-January and will be located at 202 S. Central Avenue in Flagler Beach, according to front-of-house manager Tara Palazzotto. Recommended Videos Marge and Ted Barnhill are husband and wife, with Marge owning the Gallery of Local Art next door to the new café. However, Marge always had a dream of operating a restaurant and Ted finally agreed to expand their investment in the city, Palazzotto said. [EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos ] Barnhill’s Café, Bar & Grill will be a three-story venue, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner with a view of the beach. It is working on hiring 20-30 employees at this time. MJ Smith is the executive chef creating the vast menu for the eatery. Right now, the test kitchen is underway, with Smith and his team working to nail down the exact dishes that will be served, according to the restaurant’s Facebook page . Meanwhile, one item Smith confirmed will be available at Barnhill’s is its breakfast crispy hash brown bowls, which he thinks will be a huge seller. These bowls will come in a variety of styles with different toppings such as eggs, cheese and bacon.
