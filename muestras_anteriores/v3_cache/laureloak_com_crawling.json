After a series of private equity transactions, Live Nation purchased C3 Presents in 2016. Bill’s work at CSE as Lance Armstrong’s long-time agent included numerous Fortune 500 endorsement deals and advertising campaigns with companies such as Nike, Visa and Coca Cola, as well as two New York Times best-selling books. Bill was one of the founding architects of the commercialization of the LIVESTRONG brand. He also served as the CEO of Tailwind Sports, managing an American and European staff of more than 60 people. At Tailwind, he led the effort to secure sponsorship of more than $25mm annually for the Discovery Channel and RadioShack professional cycling teams. Bill then co-founded New Waterloo, a hospitality management and development company based in Austin, Texas. New Waterloo operates award-winning hotels and restaurants such as the South Congress Hotel, Hotel Ella, La Condesa, and Sway ( newwaterloo.com ). Bill was a member of the 1988 United States Olympic Swimming Team (200 IM) and served later as the Chairman of the USOC’s Athlete’s Advisory Council and as a USOC Vice President. He holds a BA, MBA and JD all from the University of Texas.

Bryce joined Dragon Global as a partner and member of the investment committee in 2011. Dragon Global began as a private equity firm focused on late-stage, pre-IPO technology investments (e.g., Facebook (now Meta)), and expanded to include venture-capital investments, self-funded technology startups and a mixed-use real estate assemblage in Miami, Florida. In 2015, Bryce left to form Lone Star Ventures, an investment and advisory firm specializing in technology, media, real estate and hospitality.  Shortly after making an early-stage investment in Core Scientific, a blockchain and AI company, Bryce became its President, CEO and Chairman of the Board.  Core went public in 2021 through a SPAC.
