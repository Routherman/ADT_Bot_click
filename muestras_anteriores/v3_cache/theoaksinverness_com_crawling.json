It was raining and dark. We had NO reservation, but when we pulled into the park (happily) there was someone there to help us. We only stayed 2 nights, but I would definitely stay there again! We were going to the Webster Flea Market but we had no car. John, one of your residents, offered to take us and pick us up. That was above and beyond. Thank you all! Mary S , From TripAdvisor Good location! However, what makes it special is the staff! They are very friendly and hospitable. I am looking forward to going back for a visit. They go out of there way to give you the feeling of home. G Richman, Retired, US Army , From TripAdvisor My husband and I have lived full-time in our RV since 2012. We love it. Breezy Oaks RV Park is a sweet place to live that truly always has a breezy. It is next to I-75 which makes it super easy for shopping and our favorite restaurant. We love this park. Friendly campers and a great park to live in. Prices are perfect, too! Shelley D , From TripAdvisor Most Accommodating. We had some mechanical problems with our truck, which was pulling a 5th wheel. Jim came and towed us to Breezy Oaks RV Park. We liked the park so much we stayed there 11 days. The park is well kept with full hookups. They have just added new spaces, which are wide and comfortable. Jan F , From TripAdvisor My husband and I are fulltimers since 2000 and have the age to be a “permanent” in this wonderful park. It fits all our expectations for a home place. We live here since May 2015 and we hope that our health allows us many, many years to call this resort our home. Our Thanks goes to the manager and to the new owners, who are very nice. The residents are super-friendly, too. Karin B , From Facebook Great park. Really easy access to the highway. New owner has bought the park and they are doing a bunch of work around the park and upgrades. Great people in the park. Room to roam around. Nice country feel. Really enjoying the stay here. Definitely recommend. J Slifer , From Facebook We have loved this park from day one when we arrived in 2003. When we come here to escape the cold & snowy winters, we leave our families in various states & even Canada. It makes it much easier to come “home” to our winter family. There are many nice folks that come back every year. Great karaoke, jams, & potluck dinners,too. Hopefully Jr. & I will be able to come back many, many more winters.
