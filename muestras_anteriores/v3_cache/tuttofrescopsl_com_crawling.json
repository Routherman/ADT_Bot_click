Fresco Inc. brings the best of Italy’s gourmet foods, including truffle specialties, to the world. From a humble start in Italy, the founder’s journey took him through the UK, where he owned and managed restaurants in London and specialized in importing and distributing Italian food. His experience in the UK laid the foundation for his deep understanding of gourmet food distribution, which he later expanded upon in the US. With years of experience working in kitchens, managing restaurants, and leading food import businesses, the founder’s commitment to quality has been the cornerstone of the company’s success. In 2015, M. Fresco Inc. was founded with a mission to connect buyers and sellers of high-quality Italian products, driven by values of professionalism, passion, and attention to detail. Our team is dedicated to providing exceptional service and sourcing the finest gourmet products, ensuring every transaction upholds the traditions of Italian culinary excellence. From restaurants to distributors, we bridge the gap between authentic Italian flavors and customers who seek quality, authenticity, and reliability. At M. Fresco Inc., we’re more than a food brokerage; we’re a family legacy built on trust, expertise, and a deep love for food. We continue to grow, offering truffle specialties and other gourmet products that enhance every culinary experience.

Food was delicious and portions were enough for 2 people. Very decent prices for the quality and amount of food. Layout is different - order and pay first at cashier, then seat yourself at a table. They will bring the food to you. Highly recommend if you are feeling Italian. review by - YELP Sarai A: This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is 10 times better than Olive Garden, and the ambience is very relaxing. They also have a drive through, which is different, but convenient if your in the go and the food is still always fresh and hot! review by - YELP Gaddy V: Absolutely love the truffle shrimp here! Chicken parm is also a good go to. The atmosphere and service is great so it always makes for a all around satisfying experience. It does get busy at times so be sure to get there early for prime patio seating. review by - YELP Karen C: Love the food here anything is good anytime I have a great time when I dine in it's always great when I can just get take out Aswell review by - YELP Melissa L: The best Italian place, but most importantly because it has a drive thru! Their spaghetti and meatballs is always a good choice, but I love the bbq bacon pizza. Service is always fast and the workers are always pleasant. They have a great lunch menu with well priced items!
