Refinery Jax Beach is a fabulous foodie community that offers Refined Dining, an upscale restaurant overlooking the ocean from the second-floor dining room, a more casual First Street Pub on the 1st floor that offers more casual dining and drinks, and the ocean bar that provides refreshments to those walking up from the beach. In addition, The Market and Lounge offers drinks and products for sale. “I am also hoping that the residents will like the place, because not only can they grab something to-go without driving anywhere … They can always go and get some delicious scratch-made breakfast, lunch, and dinner options,” Vera Duren. The restaurant’s upper story will offer fine dining, Duren says, and the downstairs space along First Street will serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a more casual setting. The market will sell beer, wine, cheese, sandwiches, and healthier on-the-go snacks. “We want to capture a lot of healthier options. I love quality foods, and I think that area needs a little better than it used to be,” she added. Refinery Jax Beach is just what people at the Beaches and across Jacksonville have needed for some time. Another great addition to the beach community.
