Fast forward a few decades, and Yeoman’s has grown into a proper celebration of British culture and cracking good times, now hailed as one of the best sports bars in Tampa. At Yeoman’s Topgolf Swing Suite, we’ve taken that same iconic vibe and added a sporty twist—think golf and game bays, custom-built pool tables, professional 14ft shuffleboards, and PGA Tour Golden Tee Live machines. Fancy a swing? Step into our bays and take a crack in year-round comfort with our complimentary clubs or your own trusty sticks. It’s all the action you need, minus the dodgy weather. We’re not just slinging food and drinks—we’re dishing up a smashing good time. Our menu? Bold, addictive, and as unforgettable as your best mate’s goal celebration. From Brit-inspired classics like fish & chips to delicious wings, hearty mac and cheese, and burgers that demand two hands, we’ve got the grub to keep you going. And the cocktails? They’re brilliantly cheeky, perfectly balanced, and always worth a second (or third) round. This is the place where the thrill of the game meets brilliantly crafted food, cheeky cocktails, and proper good company. Every seat is the best seat in the house, and the atmosphere? It’s as lively as a pub full of footie fans on match day. Whether you’re here for the big game, the big bites, or just the big cheers, you’ll find yourself coming back for those legendary moments that make game days unforgettable. The vibe here is electric—where every pint poured and every plate served comes with a side of laughs and a whole lot of character. It’s where swings meet cheers, banter meets bites, and new friends are made over every round. Your place for good times is right here—so grab your mates, your appetite, and your game face, and let’s get cheeky at Yeoman’s!
