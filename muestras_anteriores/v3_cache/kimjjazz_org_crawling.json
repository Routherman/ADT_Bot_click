Contact / “ The mission is clear, the communication is exceptional, and the willingness of staff and educators to find solutions and opportunities where others see problems is meaningfully apparent. ” — JazzED Parent Seattle JazzED Staff BJ Montoya, Curriculum Manager and Lead Teacher BJ’s passion for teaching music must have come from a family history of teachers and musicians. His grandparents were school teachers in the Philippines. And as they immigrated to North America, they were sure to bring and share their musical traditions as instrumentalists and dancers. His musical journey started as a student of Suzuki Violin Method for over 13 years at the University of Louisville School of Music Prep School. He also performed with the Louisville Youth Orchestra and other small local ensembles. Beyond the classical foundation, the violin has afforded him an opportunity to express a wider range of styles.  Since arriving in Seattle in 2001, he has been performing in a range of venues from sanctuaries to coffee shops to night clubs. He has been featured in local indie bands, gospel choirs, theater productions and his longstanding Irish party band, Whiskey Mary. His teaching builds from these experiences emphasizing social playing and creative expression through the many dialects that music has to offer whether fiddle, classical or jazz. BJ looks forward to sharing his passion for music and the joy the wonderfully versatile instrument can offer. Tessa Pargiter-Hatem, Operations Director Tessa Pargiter-Hatem first worked with Seattle JazzED as the event coordinator for the annual fundraising gala, and is thrilled to be transitioning into a more prominent operations and events position. As a graduate of the University of Washington, she is eager to be returning to Seattle’s expansive music community and deepening her PNW roots. Tessa brings a diverse skill set to her work at Seattle JazzED, with experience in environmental nonprofits, film, and the food and beverage industry. As an enthusiastic life-long learner, Tessa is motivated to help students and their families express themselves and build community through music education. When she’s not in the office, you’ll find her cycling up mountains or skiing down them, listening to anything from Pink Martini to Fred Again. Liz Riggs Meder, Executive Director Liz is an educator and nonprofit leader with a background in guiding organizations through growth and change to expand their reach and impact. She is passionate about creating access for diverse audiences and has done that for programs ranging from science curriculum for youth to outdoor risk management for adults. Profoundly shaped by her music education experience through her school years, she is eager to return to the music world and to use her change management skills to support making rich music education more accessible to all students. Liz is a long-time Seattle resident and can be found playing in the mountains either skiing down them or slowly running over them. Alyssa Seng, Communications Manager Alyssa Seng is a second-generation Southeast Asian American and a first-generation college graduate. Raised by refugees in a diverse Southern California town, her values and passion for equity and community-building are a product of the unique blend of cultures that surrounded her. She’s excited to leverage her background in communications, having worked on advocacy initiatives ranging from amplifying student voices to leading statewide public health campaigns, to support JazzED’s mission of increasing access to arts education. Raijene Walker, Development Director Raijene Walker brings over a decade of nonprofit leadership and a B.S. in Communication (specializing in Interpersonal and Organizational Communication) to Seattle JazzED. Her career spans impactful roles with youth-focused organizations including City Year, the Wade Edwards Foundation, and the Girl Scouts where she’s leveraged her communication expertise to cultivate meaningful partnerships, attract strategic support, and amplify fundraising efforts. Originally from Baltimore, Maryland, Raijene is excited to make Seattle her new home and be part of its vibrant, collaborative arts community. A lifelong lover of the arts, she looks forward to combining her passion for creativity, community, and development to support and advance JazzED’s mission of equitable arts education. Seattle JazzED Board of Directors Christian Anderson Private Wealth Advisor at Goldman Sachs Christian is a former Jazz Saxophonist turned Wealth Advisor based in Seattle. Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest as a beneficiary of the excellent public music education ecosystem, he is grateful for the opportunity to stay connected and give back through his involvement with Seattle JazzED.

Robert Babs Development Operations Manager at Seattle Opera Former Seattle JazzED Program and Operations Manager, Robert is a life-long musician and dedicated arts administrator with a passion for youth arts and education. He has worn many hats through his years of nonprofit involvement as both staff and a volunteer, working almost exclusively in programs around the greater Seattle area which strive to provide youth and educators with quality and meaningful artistic experiences. A born and raised Seattle local, Robert studied English and History at the University of Washington, with minors in Music and French Studies. Though not a jazz musician himself, he’s a great jazz appreciator. Robert’s current musical activities are as a violist of the Puget Sound Symphony Orchestra (among others), a music coach-clinician in Seattle Public Schools, and playing chamber music with friends whenever possible. When not working, volunteering, or playing music Robert is an avid social dancer (contra, swing, and waltz). He also serves on the advisory board of Meany Center for the Performing Arts. Harold Brandford Physician / Anesthesiologist Harold moved to Seattle forty years ago to finish his medical training. Still working as an anesthesiologist but in the process of exploring opportunities to become more socially involved, five years ago he discovered Seattle JazzED. He welcomed an opportunity to join the board and has served as chair of the Gala Committee for the past two years. He is excited by the fact that JazzED has transformed the lives of thousands of youngsters in the area, and looks forward to the occupancy of our new home, JazzHouse.

Erica Garvey Finance and Real Estate Professional Erica has been a fan of jazz and jazz education starting from her days in high school jazz band. She got involved with JazzED after reading a news article about the new school the organization was planning to build, and quickly developed an interest in the whole program. Erica currently works in corporate finance for a Seattle-based tech company, and has spent much of her professional career in commercial real estate investment and development. She is an avid consumer of live music and you can often find her out in Seattle catching one of the many great local bands. Erica lives with her dog, Seven, and splits her time between Seattle and Colorado. Angie Jenkins Director of Seattle University Learning Assistance Programs Angie is originally from Kingston, Jamaica, and currently serves as the Director of Learning Assistance Programs at Seattle University, a program with the purpose of offering comprehensive academic support to students outside of the classroom to contribute to their overall success.  She has worked at Seattle University since 2005 and in the education field (pre-school through higher education) for over 20 years. Angie is an active member on various committees supporting her children's education experiences, particularly around equity, access and inclusion work.  This focus is what drew her to JazzEd years ago when her son participated in one of their summer programs.  She was struck by their commitment to issues of access and equity and genuine desire to serve the BIPOC community not just in statements but in daily practice.  This has continued to be evident as she has been on the board and she is excited to be a part of this journey. Erica McIntyre Staff Accountant at Seattle Opera Erica is a nonprofit accountant at Seattle Opera with a background in jazz saxophone. She is a graduate of Interlochen Arts Academy high school, and Seattle University where she got her degree in Finance with Accounting.

(NNS file photo by Sue Vliet) The flyers are out, permits are secured, and vendors are booking booths – all in preparation for the rebooted Walker Square Farmers Market this summer. The market, which was a summer staple on the Near South Side from 2011 to 2019, is returning because of the efforts of resident leaders and grants from Bader Philanthropies and the Milwaukee Parks Foundation . Advertisement The market will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sundays from July 6 through Sept. 28 in Walker Square Park, 1031 S. 9th St. Vendors will be selling fresh produce and accepting WIC, SNAP/FoodShare and Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program vouchers. The market will feature fitness and wellness activities in the morning and live music from noon to 2 p.m. The overall goal is to support local farmers, provide neighbors with access to fresh and healthy foods and create a positive activity that brings people together, said Nicole Hertel Meirose, a co-leader of the Friends of Walker Square Park. “Ultimately, all of those things just mean a better quality of life for everybody who’s part of it,” Hertel Meirose said. The path to bringing it back The farmers market honors the memory of Jason Cleereman , a Walker Square resident who organized the market for years before his death in 2020. “We have missed him dearly and we have also missed the farmers market and the many other wonderful things that he did for the neighborhood,” Hertel Meirose said. In the years since the pandemic and Cleereman’s death, residents have wanted to bring back the farmers market. “We all work full-time jobs and didn’t want to start that project because it was massive,” said Gladys Reyes, a member of the Walker Square Neighborhood Association leadership team. “But after years, we just decided, you do this, you do that, we all took a little piece.” Through the forming of the Friends of Walker Square Park in 2023 and planning of the park’s upcoming improvement project , residents became connected with the Milwaukee Parks Foundation. The foundation applied for and secured a $25,000 grant from Bader Philanthropies on behalf of the Walker Square Neighborhood Association and Friends of Walker Square Park for the farmers market. The Milwaukee Parks Foundation also provided an $8,000 Sprouts grant for a concert series during the market, which the group will use to pay for local musicians, booking and sound equipment. “We’ll give you the dollars and we’ll give you the resources, but we want you to be able to activate your own community and stay connected with your own community because that’s what’s going to create that thriving park system,” said Kelly Martyka, partnerships consultant with the Milwaukee Parks Foundation. Working with farmers To make the market a success, the neighborhood groups hired Isabel Miranda as market manager and contracted a Hmong interpreter to help communicate with farmers. Though it’s Miranda’s first time running a farmers market, she has experience growing up in Walker Square, working with federal nutrition programs and supporting Square Plaza Market, a makers market in the park organized by her mother, Rosa Rodriguez. Miranda has taken on the challenge of recruiting vendors for the new Sunday market. She said they are concerned about competition and having steady customers. “I obviously can’t guarantee that, but we’re hoping that with the live music and maybe having different activity, that will keep an audience there at all times,” Miranda said. Six vendors have signed up: five farmers and one eggroll vendor. The group is hoping to get to 10 vendors, with 90% selling produce. Three of the farmers are returning vendors from previous years, Miranda said. There will be joint events for the farmers market and Square Plaza Market on July 20 and Aug. 17, which will make the park more active. Hertel Meirose is hopeful that working with a Hmong interpreter, who will be present for at least an hour on most market days, will help Hmong farmers feel welcome and part of the process. “We really do want to be able to have the farmers be able to communicate what their wishes are and what their needs are for the market because they are a very important part of it,” she said. The Walker Square Farmers Market logo was created by John Fleissner, a local printmaker, muralist and teacher. It includes the trees, clock tower and steeples of the neighborhood, symbols of produce and tools, and uses English and Spanish to represent the bilingual nature of the neighborhood. (Photo provided by John Fleissner) How are residents involved? Different neighbors have taken the lead on applying for various permits, promoting the event and seeking community recommendations for the music lineup. John Fleissner, a local printmaker, muralist and teacher, created the market’s new square-shaped logo that incorporates elements from the neighborhood’s scenery. Miranda hopes the market will be a weekend destination for families and a convenient place for senior residents of the nearby United Community Center to use their senior farmers market vouchers. “I’m excited that they will be able to have that little bit of a short walk and easy access to be able to use those benefits,” Miranda said. How to get involved Going forward, the groups will be looking for sponsorships and continued grants to keep running the market each summer without overcharging vendors, Hertel Meirose said.

(Grace Lundwall) Beehive Freeze Honey Slush will be selling honey slush at the 2025 Downtown Farmers Market. Nearly 20 new food vendors will be featured at this summer’s Downtown Farmers Market , which kicks off Saturday at Salt Lake City’s Pioneer Park. They’ll be selling everything from cheese and sourdough to kimchi and hot sauce on Saturdays through Oct. 25, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. [ Read more: Finally, a solution for Pioneer Park? SLC, Downtown Alliance to make it a year-round home for the farmers market. ] Here are some details on five of those new vendors, who will be selling local honey, smash burgers, strombolis, bread and a treat called “honey slush” that was invented in Hawaii. That’s not all that’s new. Downtown Farmers Market director Carly Gillespie said there will be several firsts at this year’s market, including its first raw-milk vendor ( Springbrook Dairy ) and its first stroopwafel vendor ( AmsterDam Delicious will be making them onsite ). Gillespie said this will also be the first time in a decade that a vendor will just be selling kimchi ( Do Young Kimchi ). And it won’t be offering anything edible, but Best Edge Sharpening is new this year, too. Gillespie said there was a knife sharpener at the market for years that was “super popular,” but it moved to southern Utah. “We are excited to have a new mobile knife- and tool-sharpening option for our patrons,” she said. To discover all of the new vendors, visit the Downtown Farmers Market, held at 350 S. 300 West. Beehive Freeze Honey Slush If you’re never tasted honey slush, it starts with a sorbet made with fruit juice and honey. Then that “slush” is topped with raw honey and other ingredients, like locally sourced fruit, cacao nibs and coconut cream. Beehive Freeze Honey Slush owner Ellie Magleby and her partner, Branden McQueen-Bryers, first encountered honey slush in Hawaii, where they worked at the Oahu cafe whose owners invented it as a healthier alternative to shaved ice, Magleby said. After selling honey slush on the island for above five years, the couple moved back to Utah — where Magleby is from — and brought the recipe for honey slush with them. They started Beehive Freeze, and have been making and selling honey slush for about two years, she said. At the Downtown Farmers Market, Magleby and McQueen-Bryers will be selling four flavors of honey slush — pina colada, passion fruit, strawberry and coffee — plus a seasonal flavor that will rotate depending on the fresh produce they can get. Look for Beehive Freeze in the northwest corner of the park, on the inside edge of the sidewalk. Marcato Kitchen The centerpiece of Marcato Kitchen ‘s menu is the stromboli, an Italian-American creation that’s something like a baked pizza sandwich, or a “rolled-up pizza,” said chef and Marcato Kitchen founder Kyle Williams. However you describe them, they’re delicious, a bread pocket filled with Italian meats, cheeses and sometimes veggies. Williams — who’s been a chef for seven years — was first introduced to the stromboli by a Sicilian chef he used to work with. When Williams started Marcato Kitchen about a year and a half ago, he wanted to shine “a new light” on the stromboli, which pizzerias often treat as an afterthought, he said. Not so at Marcato Kitchen, where fillings like giardiniera, meatballs and goat cheese shine — along with classics like pepperoni and salami. For the Downtown Farmers Market, Williams will be selling pre-packaged strombolis that you can reheat at home, as well as his popular brown-butter chocolate chip cookies. Look for the Marcato Kitchen booth along 300 West, on the street side of the sidewalk. Girls Who Smash (Negley Stockman) Girls Who Smash will be selling smash burgers at the 2025 Downtown Farmers Market. As hinted by their tongue-in-cheek business name, Girls Who Smash co-founders Cami Aglaure and Carly Porter make smash burgers, inspired by Porter’s time in New York City. If you’re unfamiliar with this burger, Aglaure said you make a smash burger by taking a ball of ground beef and smashing it as flat as you can get it, so the edges char and get crispy while the interior stays juicy. Girls Who Smash boast that they use fresh, never-frozen certified Angus beef. While the burgers are cooking, the married couple add thinly sliced onions that “almost melt into the patty,” Aglaure said, then they flip the patties over and add American cheese. Once the cheese is melted, they stack the grilled patties two deep, add banana peppers and their secret sauce (which Porter describes as a white “slightly spicy aioli”) and call it good. At the Downtown Farmers Market, Girls Who Smash also will sell fries cooked in beef tallow, which Aglaure said gives them more flavor. Look for their food truck on the north end of the park, by the other food vendors. The Grey Rabbit Artisan Bakery David Lichty was a hobby baker for years before he started baking professionally, he said, and he would give his bread and other baked goods to his neighbors. When his day job as a compliance officer for a New York City bank ended, he said he had already been thinking about launching a bakery. Lichty trained at the Park City Culinary Institute, then started baking in a commissary kitchen in Salt Lake City and launched The Grey Rabbit Artisan Bakery . He’s been selling his bread mostly at pop-ups in Bountiful, and said he’s feeling “very lucky” that he was accepted as a first-time vendor at the Downtown Farmers Market. Lichty is going to have a variety of bread for sale at the market, including country wheat, gruyere, candied jalapeño & gruyere, olive, porridge bread, nine grain, country rye, chocolate rye and buckwheat buttermilk. He’ll also have French apple turnovers and lemon cream pastries, as well as cinnamon rolls, cardamom buns and other baked items. Look for The Grey Rabbit Artisan Bakery booth at the north end of the park, across from Caputo’s Market & Deli. Higbee Honey Mike Higbee, owner and founder of Higbee Honey , said he first became interested in beekeeping when he was working for the Utah Air National Guard. He had been talking with a colleague at work who got into beekeeping, and Higbee said he was fascinated by explanations of the way honeybee colonies operate. He was also interested in self-sufficiency, and the idea of producing his own honey was “very appealing to me,” Higbee said. So he started with one hive of bees in the Morgan Valley, “to learn and make sure I could keep them alive,” Higbee said. When that experiment went well, he expanded to 10 hives, then 30, always selling out of the honey his bees made. And in his travels for the military, he would meet other beekeepers, and soon realized “there’s a whole world of honey out there.” Higbee became what he calls a “honey connoisseur,” curating unique honeys from around the world. At the Downtown Farmers Market, Higbee will be selling Wasatch wildflower honey, as well as light and dark varieties also produced in the Wasatch Mountains. And he plans to have black sage honey and orange blossom honey, made by his overwintering bees in southern California. Look for Higbee Honey along 300 West, on the park side of the sidewalk.
