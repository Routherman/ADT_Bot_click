When we arrived at the course, they were out of golf carts and every group going out had to wait for the groups to finish on hole 18. The staff did an amazing job of getting carts turned around as quickly as they could. Also, the desk staff was a bit confused with our tee time and reservation since it came from golfscape and the times did not match up. Golfscape showed us having a 1:04pm tee time, but the course put us in at 1:16pm. We were fortunate not many tee times were behind us, not sure what would have happened if the tee sheet would have been full.

In 1987, their dream materialized as the MetroWest Golf Club opened its doors, inviting golfers to take their first swings on the pristine fairways. Word quickly spread about the challenging yet picturesque course, propelling MetroWest Golf Club’s reputation as a must-play destination for golfers of all levels. Robert Trent Jones Sr.’s masterful design, characterized by signature rolling fairways, large undulating greens, and strategically placed bunkers, has withstood the test of time.
