The Road We All Traveled Five years after Hurricane Andrew destroyed a large part of the historic art deco Seminole Theatre, known to the community as the movie house, the owner of a local Montessori school had the persistent idea to put the theatre back together. Recruiting a local architect, along with two Montessori parents and a group of community volunteers, The Seminole Theatre Group was formed and the restoration effort began. A collaborative direction unfolded and soon thereafter contact was made with a known theatre architect in Sarasota, Florida. The vision to create a theatre to provide a venue for the performing arts, community events, and arts education was brought to life. Major funding would be needed to complete the project and in 1997 a public/private partnership was formed between the City of Homestead and the Seminole Cultural Arts Theatre, Inc.  (The Seminole Theatre Group) to work together to raise needed funds to complete the project. Action was next. Plans were drawn, permits were issued, and the demolition began. The donated replica for the Marquee arrived and was installed in 2002. The redesigned theatre included constructing the south building to house the rehearsal/ education spaces and dressing rooms. A 62’ fly tower was added to the stage house. The north wall was expanded for extra space including the patio area. Years in the making, the expanded exterior was finished. Thanks to the hard work of so many, and with the completion of the project by the City of Homestead, the vision has been realized.

Flagler St., was dismantled, put on a train and hauled to Homestead. It was rebuilt and placed on Old Dixie Highway, east of Krome Avenue, and was renamed the Homestead Garden Theatre. Sometime between 1916 and 1919, the movie theater changed names becoming the Homestead Movies, according to Bob Jensen, president of the Town Hall Museum in Homestead and member of the Miami-Dade County Cultural Affairs Council. In 1919, the building was renamed the Seminole Theatre. In 1921, it ceased being a theater when early pioneers James Washington English and Henry Booker Sr. built a new theater in downtown Homestead and took the name with them, now known as the Seminole Theatre. It opened Nov. 26, 1921. In March 1940, the theater burned down after a fire started on the stage. It is still not known what caused the fire. Fire trucks were sent in from Coral Gables, South Miami and the city of Miami, but it wasn’t enough. “It burnt down completely. All that was left was the shell and the sky. And so when it was rebuilt, it was completely redesigned.” In the meantime, a screen was set up in the alley and people watched movies. When the theater was first rebuilt in 1940, it was designed with the current Art Deco facade. The Seminole closed its doors in 1979 due to financial trouble and suffered a near total loss from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. In 1993, the owners donated the dilapidated structure to the city and historic preservationists have been working since to bring it back. The effort for its opening wasn’t easy. The process was laborious and decades in the works by devoted citizen groups passionate about historic preservation. During the May 2014 bond referendum, Homestead voters voted in favor of a $5 million bond to renovate the historic theater as a cultural center. Soon after, an additional $550,000 was awarded in the form of two state grants. The funding allowed for the complete restoration of the space, bringing it back as a cultural hub for Homestead. After nearly 40 years of being forlorn, a restored Seminole Theatre in Homestead reopened its doors on December 12, 2015 for the Grand Opening Gala, “A Night on Broadway.” We thank the community for the devoted and continuing support to bring this historic arts center back to life.

PINNACLE NAMED TO MANAGE HISTORIC SEMINOLE THEATRE IN HOMESTEAD, FL MICKEY MCGUIRE NAMED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NEWLY RENOVATED VENUE HOMESTEAD, FL, November 30, 2015 – Pinnacle Venue Services has signed a multiyear agreement with the City of Homestead, FL, to manage the historic and newly renovated, 500-seat Seminole Theatre, it was announced today by Doug Higgons and Tom Paquette, Managing Partners of Pinnacle. Pinnacle also named Mickey McGuire, a veteran of theater management, operations and marketing, as the new Executive Director of the Seminole Theatre. The renovated downtown Homestead landmark, which first opened in 1921 as a movie and live entertainment showplace, debuted this month. With the aid of a $5 million bond referendum approved by voters last year, the venue has been completely renovated with all of the newest technical equipment and customer comforts. Higgons said Pinnacle will be providing all management and operational services for the regional performing arts center, while Anchor Arts Management, Inc., of Miami Beach, FL, headed by Gary Lund, will coordinate a full range of diversified, quality performing arts programming, including ethnic entertainment, to appeal to men, women and children throughout the Homestead region. \"The Seminole Theatre is a gem in Homestead that will glow brighter than ever with the plans we have for the performing arts center,\" Higgons said. \"In addition to a host of top performers and productions, we hope to create new and expanded events that will combine the Seminole Theatre with adjacent Losner Park for family festivals and special events. Our mission is to bring new excitement, fun and activity to downtown Homestead.\" \"We are extremely delighted to be partnering with Pinnacle Venue Services as we begin this new era in the history of the Seminole Theatre,\" said City Manager George Gretsas. \"There is an enthusiastic new spirit and sense of pride in our city for our 94-year-old regional performing arts center that will once again become an important cultural and entertainment center for all Homestead and Dade County residents.\" McGuire formerly was Associate General Manager at DR Theatrical Management in New York City where his responsibilities included coordinating with commercial and nonprofit theater clients in New York and throughout the country. Earlier, Mickey worked as Assistant Contracts Manager for The Road Company, handling national tours of Wicked, Grease, The Color Purple, David Copperfield and more. He has also worked as a Marketing Assistant with TheaterMania in New York City and with the marketing department at Lincoln Center where he worked on the annual summer events Midsummer Night Swing and Lincoln Center Festival. In New Brunswick, NJ, Mickey served for two years as the Managing Director of The Livingston Theatre Company. Mickey has worked as both a Director and Stage Manager in New York City and regionally. He received a bachelor's degree in Theatrical Management from Rutgers University. \"Mickey's vast experience in theater and entertainment brings the new Seminole Theatre an outstanding leader who has the contacts, knowledge and commitment to bring new and exciting entertainment to residents of the Homestead area,\" Higgons said. \"We are very pleased to have him on our Pinnacle team.\" The Seminole Theatre was decimated when Homestead was battered by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. In 1993, the theatre's owners donated the building to the city, which later designated it a local historic site, the sole remaining example of Art Moderne style architecture in Dade County.
