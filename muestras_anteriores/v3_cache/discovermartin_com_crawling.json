From now until the end of October we follow “sea turtle friendly” practices to ensure our beaches remain safe places for nesting and hatching. Click here to learn how to visit our beaches during sea turtle nesting and thank you for helping to protect these amazing and threatened species! Beach Basics for Sea Turtle Nesting Season: CLEAN Take all trash with you, make sure to take all toys or beach furniture off the beach at the end of the day FLAT When you leave the beach make sure to knock down any sand castles and fill in any holes DARK Any light on the beach, from beach front rooms to flashlights, scare away and deter sea turtles from nesting. Dim lights, close curtains and refrain from using any lights on the beach at night.  The best way to view sea turtles is to sign up for a permitted sea turtle nesting program! Such programs are offered by multiple organizations in Martin County such as: Florida Oceanographic Society , Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge , Ecological Associates, Inc. , and Explore Natural Martin (in collaboration with Ecological Associates). These Marine Sea Turtle Permits are managed through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Want to win cool eco-swag? Sign up for our free Explore Natural Martin EcoTrail !

Blandford , Max Chesnes , Keona Gardner , Will Greenlee , Sara Marino , Joshua Solomon , Tyler Treadway and TCPalm staff. Compilation and digital presentation by Maureen Kenyon . __________________________________ A near-miss from a Category 5 hurricane . A series of busts at massage parlors in which half a dozen spas were closed and hundreds of men were implicated . An outbreak of hepatitis A, with no known cause . A governor making the environment a top priority . These stories and many others were the biggest of 2019 that shaped the lives of residents in Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties. Many of the stories also shaped policy and will continue to define and guide the future of those living on the Treasure Coast. First, here's an overview of stories that affected Martin County residents. Next, are stories that impacted the entire Treasure Coast. MARTIN COUNTY Pilot dies in crash before Stuart Air Show Joseph Masessa , 59, died Nov. 1 after his 1968 Grumman OV-1 Mohawk crashed at Stuart’s Witham Field as he prepared for the Audi Stuart Air Show that was to start later that day. It was the first fatality at the Stuart Air Show in its 30-year history, according to officials. The air show's nighttime events were cancelled Nov. 1, but festivities Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 were set to go on as planned. However, heavy rain and flooding caused officials to cancel events on both days. Air show fatalities are rare, according to John Cudahy, president of the Virginia-based International Council of Air Shows, but cancellation of an entire air show is unprecedented . ► Gil Smart: After disastrous weekend, can the Stuart Air Show survive? | Trending ► Air show must go on, but when?: Community support needed to make it next year Masessa reportedly told two people that “no acrobatic maneuvers were to be performed,” according to a preliminary report released Nov. 18 by the National Transportation Safety Board. A final NTSB report could take more than a year. Martin County on Dec. 17 agreed to give the air show $150,000 to help it continue in 2020. Indiantown Nonprofit Housing director charged with embezzlement Donna Carman, 59, the former longtime executive director of Indiantown Nonprofit Housing, pleaded guilty Oct. 14 in federal court to a felony charge after being accused of “siphoning” thousands of dollars from the not-for-profit corporation . According to unsealed federal records, Carman was identified as the executive director in 2014 and 2015 of the housing agency headquartered in Indiantown. Sentencing for Carman is Dec. 23. The maximum sentence includes 10 years in prison and up to three years supervised release. ► In support: Some in Indiantown stand behind Carman, the chamber of commerce executive who faces federal theft charge Woman, 1-year-old girl killed in boat crash Paige Barrett , 28, of Palm City, and 1-year-old Hudson Matakaetis, of Stuart, were killed Oct. 28 when they were thrown from a boat after it crashed into a channel marker in the Intracoastal Waterway . Barrett's husband, Kyle, 31, was operating the boat when it struck the 15-foot tall wood piling around 8:15 p.m. near Sandsprit Park and Sewall's Point, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Eight people were onboard, five of whom were ejected, according to FWC, which investigated the crash. Longtime fisherman J.J. Klarmann said the general spot were the crash happened is known to locals as “the cut.” “We know that the cut is pretty dangerous. There’s sandbars,” he said. “You have to know where you’re going to navigate the cut.” Boaters out on the water that night said it was very dark with no moon. Stuart and Martin County officials already are looking into ways to light the channel markers . ► Ed Killer: Boating accident deaths could have been prevented, says nautical community Stuart becomes first Treasure Coast city to ban plastic straws After holding several workshops about this issue this summer, Stuart in October became the first city on the Treasure Coast to ban plastic straws , and banned single-use plastics on city-owned property. The ban will phase in beginning in 2020, but it goes into full effect in 2021 : In 2020, no restaurant or food-service establishment can display or offer plastic straws to customers. Plastic straws, though, would be available upon request. Plastic straws can be handed out without request at drive-thru restaurants. Starting 2021, no straw of any kind can be displayed or offered by a restaurant or food-service establishment. Non-plastic straws, such as paper or bamboo, can be offered to a customer upon request. Drive-thru restaurants can offer only non-plastic straws. Exceptions are medical and dental facilities; assisted-living facilities and nursing homes; and pre-packaged food and drinks. ► Trending: Stuart plastic straw ban won't save the world, but it's a key first step ► Is a straw ban illegal?: Stuart is considering a plastic straw ban. Here's why that may be illegal. TREASURE COAST Hepatitis A outbreak baffles officials The Treasure Coast in April became part of a national and statewide outbreak of hepatitis A. It first gained attention in Martin County when attorney Jeffrey Kirsch and his wife, Nancy, both 62, died March 28 from what the Medical Examiner's Office said was \"complications of hepatitis A.\" The virus typically causes infected people to have flu-like symptoms, but rarely is fatal . Martin County was identified as a high-risk area when five cases were confirmed April 1, but state and local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not pin down the source of hepatitis A in Martin County. ► Gil Smart: Amid full-blown hepatitis A outbreak, Health Department needs to step up ► Gil Smart: Will state Health Department be more transparent on Hep A outbreak? The St. Lucie County became a high-risk area in early May when its Health Department confirmed its seventh case of hepatitis A. The Indian River County Health Department confirmed its first case May 27. At a July 10 news conference, the Florida surgeon general and the Florida Department of Health made hepatitis A a top priority . At that time, four people, all from Palm City, had died from complications of the virus. On Aug. 1, Florida Department of Health officials declared a \"public-health emergency,\" just two weeks before a fifth person died in Martin County. ► Gil Smart: Hepatitis A killed her husband; now she wants answers from Health Department ► Florida Department of Health: Martin County's 15 cases of Hepatitis A this year exceeds past 7 years combined As of Oct. 5, Martin County had the highest number of cases of the three counties , with 40 cases and five deaths since Jan. 1. St. Lucie County has 42 cases and Indian River, 15. Florida Department of Health officials reported in October that new cases are not appearing statewide as quickly as they had been. Massage parlor busts generate national attention A series of busts at massage businesses in Martin, Indian River and Palm Beach counties began becoming public in February during and after a briefing at the Martin County Sheriff’s Office. During the investigation, more than a half-dozen spas were closed and hundreds of men were implicated , accused of paying masseuses for sex acts, as were the women whom investigators said worked at and/or ran the establishments. The cases generated national attention when Jupiter police accused New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft of patronizing one of the spas, Orchids of Asia Day Spa, two times in as many days. ► The full story: Florida human trafficking ring, prostitution in massage parlors ► Judge's ruling: Robert Kraft sex spa video evidence will not be released in masseuse's court case Law enforcement officials, particularly Martin County Sheriff William Snyder, discussed possible links to human trafficking, though as the months went on, they backed away from that assertion. Much of the evidence in the cases involved video footage of the alleged sex acts. Cameras were surreptitiously installed in some of the spas after investigators obtained warrants. But several judges in the three counties have ruled to suppress some of the footage from legal proceedings, a significant blow to prosecutors’ cases. Hearings related to the video evidence in the Kraft case have been particularly protracted, as prosecutors have taken steps to appeal the rulings. ► Who was arrested?: Human trafficking investigation on the Treasure Coast DeSantis makes environment top priority Gov. Ron DeSantis wasted no time in making 2019 a year with a focus on Florida’s environment. The changes on the Treasure Coast were palpable, highlighted by the lack of discharges from Lake Okeechobee leading to toxic algae blooms and the environmental, economic and health problems they have caused in past years. On Jan. 10, his third day on the job , DeSantis outlined his environmental policies and asked all members of the South Florida Water Management District board to resign. The board members, all appointed by former Gov. Rick Scott, either resigned or let their appointments run out. DeSantis started appointing new members, including Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch of Sewall’s Point to represent Martin and St. Lucie counties. By the board’s April meeting, all the members were DeSantis appointees . Board members promised transparency and an emphasis on the district’s role of environmental stewardship. Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers — with some pushing from U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Palm City, and several environmental groups — let Lake Okeechobee’s water level drop lower than usual in the winter-spring dry season to help grasses at the bottom of the lake grow and to help prevent the need for harmful discharges to the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee rivers during the summer wet season. Residents along the rivers applauded the move, while farmers and municipalities south of the lake wondered if they would have enough water during the next dry season. The move was deemed a success when, despite a scare from Hurricane Dorian, damaging discharges were averted. DeSantis also: Approved a state budget for fiscal year 2019-2020 with $625 million for environmental projects . Appointed Tom Frazer , a professor of natural resources and environment at the University of Florida, as Florida's first chief science officer. Appointed a Blue-Green Algae Task Force and promised to turn its first set of recommendations into proposals for the 2020Legislature. Recommended a state budget for 2020-21 that again earmarks $625 million for Everglades restoration and water-quality programs. A close call from Hurricane Dorian Residents diligently prepared for a direct hit from Hurricane Dorian , one of the most intense hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic,and then breathed a collective sigh of relief when the slow-moving Category 5 storm turned north just offshore. (But even Jim Cantore thought Dorian would hit here.) ► Everybody loves Jim: Where is Jim Cantore? Still in Martin County ► Beach repairs: Hurricane Dorian-damaged beaches in Vero Beach get emergency sand repairs to prevent more erosion However, its wrath did not spare the Bahamas. The island chain was battered with 185-mph winds for more than 24 hours, and survivors' horrifying tales of riding out the hurricane surfaced soon after. Thousands of Treasure Coast residents donated supplies to their hurricane-ravaged neighbors. Staff writer Max Chesnes and photographer Patrick Dove traveled to Freeport, Bahamas, with Military Flights International, as the nonprofit organization dropped off supplies and delivered evacuees to safety. ► Generosity abounds: Port St. Lucie doctor donates $250,000 for Hurricane Dorian relief in the Bahamas ► Animals need care, too: Vet and others flew out of Fort Pierce to Bahamas to treat horses affected by Hurricane Dorian ► Safe, but shaken: Vero Beach man made contact with family living in the Bahamas after Dorian's damage Cleveland Clinic takes over hospitals On Jan. 1, Cleveland Clinic completed its takeover of Martin Health System and its three hospitals — two in Stuart and one in Port St. Lucie — as well as Indian River Medical Center in Vero Beach. It revealed the hospitals will be renamed : Indian River Medical Center became Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital . Martin Medical Center in Stuart became Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital . Martin Hospital South in Stuart became Cleveland Clinic Martin South Hospital . Tradition Medical Center in Port St. Lucie became Cleveland Clinic Tradition Hospital . The new Cleveland Clinic Family Health Center opened in October at Kanner Highway and Indian Street in Stuart and the $36 million, 87,000-square-foot facility is expected to be a one-stop shop for medical care. Cleveland Clinic also increased its footprint in Port St. Lucie on Nov. 13 when the City Council gave final approval for it to lease the former Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute of Florida for $1 a year for 15 years. ► Making good: Cleveland Clinic, FIU, Christ Fellowship help Port St. Lucie make good on failed economic projects The lease marks the first time the world-renowned hospital will conduct research outside Cleveland. The Cleveland Clinic plans to carry through with plans for a $30 million Neuroscience Center of Excellence near its Tradition Hospital. ► Laurence Reisman: As Cleveland Clinic takes over hospitals, you might be surprised by new 'caregivers' ► More free care: Indian River County Hospital District changes poverty qualifications; more people will get free care About this project TCPalm and Treasure Coast Newspapers compiled a list of stories from 2019 that had the biggest impact on the Treasure Coast as well significant meaning to the residents of Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties. Several other factors were considered when choosing the stories, including digital page views on TCPalm and reaction on social media.

The Aerial Adventure Forest is essentially an obstacle course in the trees and includes climbing, zip lines and combinations of the challenge bridges and zip lines. The Adventure Park at Sandy Spring has 15 trails, which are color-coded, with purple — the easiest — being a 12- to 20-foot-high course, and double black diamond — the most difficult — being 65 feet in the air. The Labyrinth, which opened in 2013, is an innovative pole based climbing structure offering many of the same challenges as the Aerial Adventure Forest, but on a smaller scale. The Labyrinth is unique in that the entire structure is available to rent out privately for groups and parties aged 7 & up. The Adventure Park is amongst a small group of parks around the globe that are recognized as accredited operations by the Association for Challenge Course Technology (ACCT). The Park is built and maintained to the standards of the ACCT specifications, among the most stringent ropes course safety standards in the world. AERIAL FOREST PARK The Aerial Forest Park (AFP) is a new concept in the US, but in Europe (France, Switzerland, England, Austria, and Germany) it has become a very popular experience for outdoor enthusiasts of all ages. Families, friends and individuals are involved in healthy outdoor activities, building strength, endurance, and confidence. They provide an opportunity for everyone to enjoy the outdoors and the beauty of nature. These parks contain courses made of small platforms constructed at various levels in the trees. The platforms are connected by different types of bridges (that represent obstacles) and participants, using safety harnesses, maneuver from platform to platform. The parks operate with virtually no negative environmental impact and the trees (our most important assets) are well cared for and protected. ECOTOURISM ROPES COURSE PARKS AS SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL DESTINATIONS Ecotourism focuses on responsible travel, personal growth, and environmental sustainability. It places great importance on environmental awareness, respect for nature, and empowerment of local people, corporate responsibility, creating positive experiences, whilst aiming to provide financial benefits for both businesses and local communities. All of these goals and outcomes make a ropes course park a very ecofriendly and sustainable business. CHARITABLE DONATIONS Each year, The Adventure Park donates hundreds of tickets to local charities and qualified community fundraising efforts.

      "text": "One of two busy boat ramps at Sandsprit Park has been replaced News Indian River Martin St. Lucie Sports Advertise Obits eNewspaper Legals MARTIN COUNTY Martin County's $2.4 million boat-ramp replacement project at Sandsprit Park halfway done Keith Burbank Treasure Coast Newspapers MARTIN COUNTY — The busiest boat ramps in county are getting an overhaul. The county recently reopened one boat ramp in Sandsprit Park and closed the other for construction. The $2.4 million project will replace the east and west ramps, which boaters use to launch into the the Intercoastal Waterway and out to the ocean. The Florida Inland Navigation District, which manages the waterways in Florida, provided $600,000 for the project and the county is paying $1.8 million. The east ramp reopened Sept. 22. Completion of west ramp construction is slated for January. \"We're halfway there,\" George Dzama, deputy director of county Public Works, told county commissioners last month. The Sandsprit Park replacement project is part of the countywide boat ramp replacement effort. \"This is the flagship project,\" Dzama said in a phone interview. The previous ramps were at the end of their useful life following 30 years of use. Wooden docks were disintegrating. Dzama hopes the new ramps will last 30-40 years. They are built to accommodate rising sea levels due to climate change, he said. New ramp getting mixed reviews Hank Kerfoot of Camden, South Carolina, was excited recently to launch his boat from the new east ramp, which has three docks. It was his first time out in his recently purchased 27-footer. \"It looks really nice,\" he said of the new east ramp. He appeared to have no trouble backing up his trailer into the water, launching his boat and pulling away. He was spending two weeks at the Chapman School of Seamanship to learn how to handle the new boat in more challenging waters. But not everyone was as excited. James Cronk, a Martin County resident and professional charter captain, said he may soon switch to a ramp at a different park. \"I hate this ramp now,\" Cronk said of the new east ramp. It used to be his home ramp, but the gangway to both floating docks is built for boats larger than his 21-footer. He cannot get off his boat safely when he is launching or loading. So he can use only the fixed dock. The east and west ramps have or will have multiple lanes for boaters to use. Each has a fixed dock, which is at a set height that does not vary with the tide. They could become submerged during an extreme tidal event, Dzama said. Floating gangways allow boaters to get to the two floating docks of the east ramp. The west will have one floating dock and gangway. Stone crab season start Oct. 15: 9 best seafood restaurants and markets for crab legs Snook regulations changes: What did FWC decide to do with Florida's most popular fish? The old docks all were fixed, Dzama added. They flooded because of rising tides, he told county commissioners. Following completion of the project, boaters with small to very large boats will be able to launch from Sandsprit Park. Even some commercial vessels will be able to use the new ramps, Dzama said. Other county work at Sandprit Park includes replacement of the boardwalk and a fishing pier. Both sustained storm damage. Martin County has most vessels registered Some 17,000 vessels were registered in Martin County in 2022, the most on the Treasure Coast, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Just over 15,400 vessels are registered in St. Lucie County while about 10,600 are registered in Indian River County. Keith Burbank is TCPalm's watchdog reporter covering Martin County.

We are passionate about our local parks, our city trees, and other shared community resources. We believe that healthy parks help grow healthy communities. We believe that our community forest not only makes our neighborhoods beautiful places to live, but provides critical functions to the health, well-being, and sustainability of urban life. And we believe that all Denver residents should have access to these critical urban resources. We work towards our mission by raising private funds for capital improvement projects of various sizes and through several ongoing programs: Denver Digs Trees , Community Forester , Mile High Tree Champions , TreeForce , and Park Legacy . We are Denver's oldest and primary city-wide park advocacy group and longest-standing tree organization. We have infused tens of millions of dollars into the city's public spaces, and we have planted more than 60,000 trees in Denver. Learn more about What We Do . Our History The Park People was created in 1969 by a small group of park enthusiasts who banded together to raise private funds to support Denver's extensive parks and recreation system. We are a separate entity from Denver's Department of Parks and Recreation, but have worked in close partnership with the department since our founding. In our 50+-year history, The Park People has infused many millions of dollars into Denver's parks through the restoration of existing park infrastructure, such as fountains and historic park buildings, and through new construction, such as playgrounds and recreation facilities. Our projects include sites in Denver's highest profile parks like the Washington Park Boat House, Cheesman Park Pavilion, Civic Center Esplanade, and City Park fountains. We also value the city's lesser known community treasures, such as the beloved Sundial & Plaza in Cranmer Park, the historic James Fleming House in Platt Park, and the award-winning Gates Tennis Center in Cherry Creek. And we look for high-need projects, such as playground builds in neighborhoods that lack access to recreation resources. Learn about our Capital Projects . The Park People is best known as the home of Denver Digs Trees , a beloved, city-wide tree distribution program founded in 1991. The program's roots grow from the initiative of a small group of neighbors in West Wash Park who organized around kitchen tables to bring affordable trees to plant throughout their neighborhood in the 1980's. These scrappy neighbors distributed 50 trees out of residents' garages their first year. Their initiative expanded in scope and was adopted by The Park People in response to a city-wide need for affordable trees. Denver Digs Trees has since become a cherished community tradition, known throughout the city as a provider of carefully selected tree species appropriate for our arid climate and urban environment. We are proud to provide affordable trees to residents in all of Denver's neighborhoods and place particular emphasis on distributing trees in under-canopied neighborhoods. Since 1991, Denver Digs Trees has distributed more than 60,000 trees to Denver residents. Learn more about Denver Digs Trees and our other urban forestry programs . Support for The Park People comes from individual donations, program fees, foundation and government grants, and corporate sponsorships. The Park People is managed and executed by a small staff, a dedicated Board of Trustees, and many hundreds of volunteers each year. Find out how you can Get Involved and how you can Contribute .
