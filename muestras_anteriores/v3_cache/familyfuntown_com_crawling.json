If I purchase an unlimited play package and don’t play for the full time, can I use the remaining time at a later date? The time starts ticking at the first attraction played, so the package will time out after the number of hours purchased. Can we play outside at night? Yes! Family Fun Town’s outdoor attractions are fully illuminated. Open Sunday-Thursday until 9pm, Friday and Saturday until 11pm, weather permitting. What is a Family Fun Town Fun Card? The Fun Card functions just like a debit card, but for Family Fun Town attractions only. Fun Cards replace tickets and tokens.
