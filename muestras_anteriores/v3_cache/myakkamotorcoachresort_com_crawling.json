The resort is on the Myakka River and close to the Gulf and many amazing beaches.  Absolutely gorgeous sunset views. The Resort has a very nice club house and every day is packed with activities during the winter months.  There is a large pool and a workout room.  There are 5 pickleball courts and a very active pickleball community. Lots of shopping and great restaurants nearby. This is the friendliest  park I have ever been to.  We love it at this resort.
