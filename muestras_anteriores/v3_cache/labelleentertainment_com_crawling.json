In 2019, he decided to leave that position to start LaBelle Home Care. When Rodney and his wife, Mesode, moved from VA to PA they discovered their oldest son was autistic. They enrolled him in bright horizons day care which required him to have a full-time aide to attend. Rodney and Mesode decided to open a care company to support their son, but discovered after the fact that that they licensed the wrong type of home care. With Mesode's healthcare background and Rodney's problem solving abilities, they decided to give the business a shot because they discovered that the need for non-medical home care was extensive.
