Traveler Reviewed Feb. 2, 2022 GREAT BEACH SPOT PDR is a a park you’ll visit once and keep going back. It’s located on the ‘bay-side’ of the highway with a fishing pier and a spot to launch paddle boards and kayaks. Walk across the private beach access bridge to a beautiful beach with plenty of room to spread out!  The hosts are extremely helpful with parking and tremendously friendly. There are public grills (gas and charcoal) for guests to use and 2-3 designated dog walks to let your pups roam around and do their business. As of 10/20/21 the bath house was out of order so you do need to use your your camper’s bathroom and (I believe) there are no pop-ups allowed- due to wind. We’ve been here 5-6 times and we plan to keep returning. Really, a great all-around spot.

Lauderdale, FL (March 15, 2019) – Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V. (NASDAQ: PLYA, “Playa”) has announced the regional appointments of Pedro Tomás and Henry Walther as general managers for Hilton La Romana and Sanctuary Cap Cana , respectively, and Manuel Antonio Perez-Alpuche as general manager for both Hilton Playa del Carmen and Panama Jack Resorts Playa del Carmen . With more than 70 years of combined hotel management experience, the trio bring unparalleled insight to four of Playa’s all-inclusive resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean. “Playa’s footprint in Mexico and the Caribbean continues to grow and accelerate with the onboarding of these leading industry veterans,” said Alex Stadlin, Chief Operating Officer at Playa Hotels & Resorts. “We aimed to hire general managers who could marry business-minded, revenue-driving acumen with a guest-first mentality that aligned with Playa’s commitment to unrivaled guest experiences. We found those characteristics in Henry, Pedro and Manuel.” A Dominican Republic native, Pedro Tomás recently transitioned to the role of general manager for the newly rebranded Hilton La Romana resort, which was recently converted from Dreams La Romana in 2018. He will oversee full property renovations, including the integration of family-friendly and adults-only concepts scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019. Tomás launched his hospitality career in 2005 as a room division manager, before transitioning in-house as a resident manager. Going on to become an award-winning hotel management professional, Tomás has been at the helm of AAA Four Diamond recognized properties and the recipient of the 2016 CHRIS Rising Star Award. A results-oriented career hotelier with longstanding experience in the luxury hotel sector, Henry Walther will oversee the recently reimagined Sanctuary Cap Cana. In his new role, Walther will apply his “bottom-line orientation” to further expand revenue lines for the unique five-star Cap Cana property. Leveraging the property’s recent multimillion-dollar renovation, Walther will strengthen Playa’s brand promise to provide an unparalleled all-inclusive experience at the expansive Punta Cana resort. Walther most recently served as the general manager of upscale properties in Cancun, Cozumel, and Merida, as well as managing director and general manager of Cancun’s first AAA Five Diamond resort. Manuel Antonio Perez-Apulche will supervise 757 guest rooms between Hilton Playa del Carmen and Panama Jack Resorts Playa del Carmen. His vast hospitality background ranges from positions in operations and human resources to sales and marketing, with experience in major property improvements and transformations. Perez-Apulche previously held roles as general manager, managing partner and project director for top global hospitality groups, and most notably led a team through the opening of a new property in Los Cabos. Using his expertise with large-scale properties, Perez-Apulche will hone a distinct identity for both Hilton Playa del Carmen and Panama Jack Resorts Playa del Carmen, solidifying their reputation as two of Mexico’s top all-inclusive resorts.

Sunsets can’t be beat!  Common areas abound and lots of music activities right in the premises.  That said, if you like “quiet” and privacy, this may not be the place for you.  Sites are tight, music at night especially weekends can be loud and late.  Owner lives on the premises.  People are very friendly, many of whom have stayed at the Playa for years.  Great spot if you like fishing or beach combing and close to many restaurants in Orange Beach or Gulf Shores.  Florabama is within walking distance. Price is high for the few amenities it provides (no pool, no planned activities, sites are mostly sand and pavers) but within reason for the proximity to the beach without paying higher resort-style prices at other locations.

The site includes WiFi, water, sewer, electricity, laundry facilities. You can also do activities such as Kayaking, boating, wildlife viewing, and fishing. Last Updated: 11/15/2024 Rates RV Site Options Starting Daily Starting Weekly Starting Monthly Full Hook Up $59.00 $354.00 Rules General Policies 1.\tCheck-In Notice – On the date of your travels to the resort, please call the office in the morning to confirm your estimated time of arrival has not changed from your reservation plans.  All arrivals MUST stop in the driveway in front of the first building near the entrance (the bath house) and call the office to let Team Rio know that you have arrived.  A staff member will come out to greet you, take you to your site and help you get backed into your site.  All RVs MUST go through our circle turn-around at the end of the resort’s driveway either at the time of your arrival (when parked on the East side of the driveway) or at the time of departure (when parked on the West side of the driveway).  RVs are not allowed to drive over or park on brick paver parking and patio areas – no exceptions.  Our staff will assist your through the turn around and to your site for a smooth and easy transition.   Check-in is at 1:00 pm and no later than 8:00 pm.  Check-out is no later than 11:00am.  So that you can enjoy paradise as long as possible, for an additional fee of $25, we do offer early check-in (as early as 8:00 am) and late check-out (as late at 6:oo pm), based on availability.   All early check-in and late check-out arrangements must be made in advance with the rental management office as it is based on availability.   RVs are not allowed to enter the resort between 8:00 pm and 8:00 am as a courtesy to all other resort guests and for the safety of all resort guests.  All RVs must be in the park before 8:00 pm (once RVs have been parked, guests are allowed to enter and exit the park in their vehicles 24-hours daily).  Please note that any guest that arrives after 8:00 pm will automatically be charged a fee of $50 for checking in past 8:00 pm (this fee is to compensate the Team Rio staff member that is required to work after office hours, late night waiting for arrivals).  Following parking and set-up, all guests are required to check-in at the office.  NO RIGS ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE RESORT BETWEEN 8:00 PM and 8:00 AM (only checked-in registered guests with RVs in the resort, and their families and guests, are allowed to enter and exit the park during after hours).  If for any reason an RV needs to depart after hours in the night, it is important that you coordinate your departure with the office since RVs are not allowed to travel through the park at night after 8:00 pm.   In the event that you arrive and have a problem with your RV site or any other problem that needs to be addressed with our office, please go to the office and discuss with the office prior to or immediately following the time of backing into your RV Site before hooking up such to assure that any problems regarding your reservation, your site or other issues are addressed immediately at check-in upon your arrival.  \n2.\tRates, Cancellation, Changes, Payment – For your convenience, we do not charge a reservation fee or a booking fee.  A non-refundable pre-payment deposit is required for all reservations.  For 1 and 2 night rentals, it is equal to the total rental charges (rental plus tax will be paid in full at time of booking); for 3-7 night rentals, it is $100 ($200 during June and July); for off-season monthly rentals, it is $200 / month; for peak season summer monthly rentals (the month of March and from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend) it is $500 / month; and for holidays and special events (black-out dates), it is equal to the minimum stay requirement of two (2) or three (3) night’s rent depending on the black-out dates (excluding tax, which is not paid until your stay).  Other charges, discounts, specials, or holiday rate changes may apply.  Special Discounted Rates may apply for Snowbirds, Playa Del Rio VIP Rewards members, and off-season rentals (discuss this with the reservations office at time of reservation).  Rates are seasonally adjusted and are subject to change without notice.  Our rates are always posted on our website and as required by FL law are posted in the rental management office on-site.  RV Site Rental Rates range from $55 / night to $125 /night depending on season, special events, holidays and site (premium sites are $10 / night additional charge), and at no time shall our rental rates exceed $150 / night during this calendar year.  Additional fees for early check-in, late check-out, late night arrival, and Premium Site upgrades (resort additional services) range from $10 to $50, and are sometimes complimentary as part of VIP Rewards program.   Posted RV Site Rental Rates and additional service fees do not include 11.5% tax that will be charged at time of check-in; and posted Boat Slip Rental Rates and additional services fees do not include 7.5% tax that will be charged at time of check-in.  Marina charges and RV site resort charges will always be ran as separate transactions.   We accept MasterCard, Visa, Discover and Cash (we do not accept American Express for deposits, but we do welcome American Express when paying your balance in the office upon arrival; and checks are not accepted unless pre-approved at time of reservation by management prior to arrival).   If it is necessary to cancel your reservation, cancellation is your option; but no refund for pre-payment deposits will be issued.  If cancellation is made with an advance notice of at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to your arrival, a resort credit for the pre-payment deposit will be applied to your next stay and the credit must be used within six (6) months following the reservation date of the cancellation.   All pre-payment deposits will be held as damages for lost rent in the event your credit is not used within six (6) months from your reservation date that was cancelled or in the event that your pre-payment deposit is forfeited due to cancellations not being made outside of thirty (30) days from the date of your reservation date.  Credits are not transferrable, cannot be used as a deposit for future reservations, and cannot be used past six (6) months from the date of the original reservation.   A “No-Show” is considered to be a renter that does not show up by 8:00 am the day following the check-in / arrival date on the reservation, and does not call the office to notify our staff of late arrival plans or reservation changes.  In the event of a No-Show, your site will not be held past the first night stay, and your deposit will be forfeited.   We do not give refunds for No-Shows, early departure or cancellations.  We do not pro-rate weekly or monthly rentals since they are already generously discounted in price from our nightly rate.  Any changes in the dates of a reservation will be based on availability and cannot be guaranteed; and in many cases may require you to be moved to a different site number and sometime may require you to give up premium sites originally booked or change your reservation dates.   Some special events (Mullet Toss, Shrimp Festival, Blue Angels Air Shows, Hangout Festival, Flora-Bama Concerts, Frank Brown International Songwriter’s Festival, and other music, arts and crafts, and other outdoor festivals) and holiday weekends (Memorial Day Weekend, 4th of July Weekend, Labor Day Weekend and New Year’s Eve) are considered black-out dates and may require a two (2) or three (3) night minimum stay.   All June and July weekend reservations require a two (2) night minimum stay.   If a reservation that includes special events and holiday dates is modified, any non-refundable pre-payment deposit paid will apply to the black out minimum requirements.  We do not give resort credits for cancellation of Black-Out dates or for cancellations of monthly reservations.  We allow advance reservations up to twelve (12) months in advance.  Prices are based on two (2) adults and up to three (3) children.   Additional guests are welcome for an additional $4 per night per guests (for additional adults and other guests).  There is no charge for additional children under the age of two (2) years old.   The maximum number of people allowed on a site is eight (8) people total.  While we always try to honor your special requests and will try to book you in requested sites when available, but we cannot guarantee a specific RV site number at time of reservation unless a premium site is reserved.  We do not assign site numbers to guests until the day of their arrival unless a premium site or special requested site is reserved since we sometimes have to relocate guests to accommodate guest needs.  Your non-refundable pre-payment deposit will guarantee your reservation, but it will not guarantee a specific site number, unless you have booked a premium site.   If your reservation information changes (such as you bringing a different vehicle or different type or size RV than was on the original reservation), we cannot guarantee you will have an RV site upon arrival unless those changes were discussed with and confirmed in advance with our office prior to the day of your arrival.   All reservations are made based on information provided by you to our office at the time of reservation, and our office cannot be responsible for your errors or omission that effect whether or not your RV site will be suitable with changes that we were not aware of in advance (showing up with extra cars, different or over-sized vehicles, different size RV, car hauling dollies or trailers, etc.).  All site rental payments are due in advance on the date of your arrival at check-in.  In the event of after-hours check-in, payment is due by 10:00 am the following day of your arrival.   If a guest has arrived and parked their RV in the resort but not checked in by 10:00 am the following morning, the credit card on file may be charged all charges of the reservation (including RV site rent, Boat Slip site rent if applicable, late check-in fee if applicable, any other resort services on the reservation, and all applicable state and county taxes).   In the event a guest does not check in at the office and sign in at the front desk making payment for the balance due (card must be swiped in person when using a credit or debit card), we reserve the right to charge an additional service charge of three percent (3%) of the booking total amount due at check in — to avoid this additional service charge, simply make sure you check in at the office upon your arrival or first thing in the morning following any late evening arrivals.   Camping is an outdoor experience, so no refunds will be given for unfavorable weather or acts of Mother Nature.  In the event of a mandatory evacuation, pre-payment deposits will be credited toward your next stay and must be used within six (6) months following the reservation arrival date.   You agree to be financially responsible for any and all damage you, your guests, your RV, your vehicle, your boat, your trailers, etc. cause to all areas of the park, to your RV site, and to others, including but not limited to: the landscaping, walls, hardscapes, utilities pedestals, lighting poles, fencing, common amenity areas, park areas, furniture, utility connections, driveway, paver parking and patio areas, concrete pads, the beach boardwalk, and all areas past the DOT ROW (any damages to county, state, federal or surrounding neighboring property around the Playa Del Rio will be between you and such entities, exclusive of Playa Del Rio).   Please use pads between your jacks and the RV concrete parking space.  All damages caused by you and your guests will be charged to your credit card on file with a bill for repairs and/or replacement emailed to the email address provided by you upon registration.  We hold credit cards on file used for reservation deposits until the guest has checked out, all charges have been paid in full, and the RV site is left with no damage or charges due.\n3.\tCheck-In, Site Appearance, Guests, Parking – All guests must check-in at the office upon arrival immediately following hook-up, unless after hours.  If after hours, all guests much check-in before 10:00 am the following day of their arrival.  All guests who have made their reservation over the phone will be required to sign-in and register at the from desk upon check-in.  All guests who have made their reservations on-line are required at the time the reservation request is sent into the reservation system to sign electronically that they acknowledge and agree to all rules, guidelines, policies and procedures of the Playa Del Rio.  Electronic signatures will also be kept on file as being the guests sign-in registration for compliance with Florida Statute 513.112.   A complete copy of the rules, guidelines, policies and procedures, as well as a copy of Florida Statute 513 is available in the rental management office for review upon request.  Also, all guests of registered occupants must check-in at the office upon their arrival and introduce themselves and who they are visiting so that we know who is in the park and what additional vehicle may be in the park.  You are responsible for your guests.  To insure smooth and quick check-in, please pull into the resort and stop in the driveway just past the first building on the left of the drive (the Bath house) leaving room for vehicles to travel normal, and call the office to notify our Resort Hosts on duty of your arrival so they can assist you into your site.   Check-in is 1:00 pm and no later than 8:00 pm.  Guests are not allowed to back into RV sites without the presence and assistance of a Playa del Rio resort host.  Check-out is no later than 11:00 am.  Late check-out may be available for a minimal additional fee, but you must check with the office for late check-out availability, and many times complimentary late check-out may be available (late check out allows guests to enjoy Paradise as late as 6:00 pm).  Each site is allowed one vehicle, one RV, and one small towing dolly, if applicable (all reservations that require more than one vehicle or that plan guests with additional cars must be planned prior to arrival so that you are placed on the appropriate RV Site for your needs).   Resort hosts will request that you park your RV as close to the rear of your RV parking pad as possible when backing you into your RV site.  Do not drive your RV or park your vehicles on sandy areas, landscaping areas or outside of your assigned RV site.  Do not park vehicles on the driveway at your RV Site unless instructed by our office.   Additional vehicles must be pre-approved by the office at the time reservation is made so that we know all vehicles on the property, and so that we are able to plan for additional vehicles (we do not guaranty any additional parking for your guests or for additional cars not on your reservation at time of booking; so it is important to register all guests and vehicles at time of making your reservation).  You must park on your own site, and parking is ONLY allowed on concrete and on brick paver surfaces.  No parking on “unoccupied” sites, no parking in the turn-around, no parking in reserved parking spots, no parking in no parking spots, no parking on the driveway unless pre-approved, and no parking where you block access.   Boat trailers and trailers are not allowed in the park unless pre-approved at time of reservation.   In special situations during slow times of the year, trailers other than car dolly units (boat trailers, car hauler trailer, and storage trailers) may be allowed to be parked in the park when pre-approved, so long as they fit on your RV site in your parking area and can be moved with your towed vehicle or by hand (we do not allow any type of trailers to be backed in using RVs).  All vehicles, approved trailers, and motorcycles that are parked in a no parking area, another RV site or blocking access will be towed at your expense.  All guests are responsible for any and all damage done to the park, park property, and to other guest’s property (and you are responsible for your guests, friends, family and visitors whether they are registered with the office or not).  All sites must be kept clean at all times.  You are responsible for keeping your site clean and free of garbage, debris, doggy poop, cigarette butts, beverage containers, etc.  In the event your site is not properly taken care of and you depart leaving your site in a condition different from how it was upon arrival, a Fifty Dollar ($50) cleaning fee will be charged to your credit card on file (we rarely charge cleaning fees, but we do exercise that option for sites that require extra care following your departure).  No clothing lines allowed (we have an on-site laundry room for your convenience).  Any work done on vehicles from necessity must be pre-approved by management.  No washing of vehicles, boats, RVs or any other equipment is allowed without pre-approval by management (there is a designated washing area onsite).  We charge a small fee for washing RVs and Vehicles in the designated washing area.   No tents, canopies (unless an attached accessory to an RV), or pop-up campers are allowed.  We welcome Motor Homes, Fifth Wheels and Travel Trailers, but our FL licenses will not allow tents or pop-up campers since all RVs must be fully self-contained.  Florida law requires a sewer ring or screw-type connectors to be used on all sewage hoses.  Please make sure that sewer and water connections are tight and secure when you hook-up.  Dumping gray water or black water on the ground is not allowed and it is against the law.    Our resort hosts always turn breakers to the off position prior to a guests arrivals; and it is important that you always make sure that our breaker systems in the electrical pedestals are in the OFF position when connecting and disconnecting your RV power to our systems.  You will be responsible for damage caused by plugging and unplugging into pedestals where breakers are on during the process of hooking up or disconnecting.  Always use your black water holding tank while in the resort, opening valve and dumping only as needed (do not leave your black tank open while in the resort) followed by flushing it out with gray water and fresh water.   Use chemicals to help dissolve solids while in the park.  Do not pour grease or place any other objects down the sewer lines, other than normal waste, and do not dump grease or cooking oils on the ground (put all oils, grease and other liquid materials into sealed containers and place them in the dumpster with your other trash and debris).  We ask that you flush and clean your gray water tanks to help flush sewer lines with clean water at the end of your stay.  Florida law requires back flow preventers on all water hose bibs.  The park is equipped with back flow preventers at all water hook up hose bibs (they are painted red or built into pedestals).  In the event you remove or damage the back flow preventer upon your departure, a Twenty five dollar ($25) replacement fee will be charged to your credit card on file.  Also, any other components to the utilities hook-up pedestal that is damaged or removed that has to be repaired or replaced that is not normal wear and tear will be charged to your credit card on file.\n4.\tChild Supervision – All children must be under adult supervision at all times.  Do not let children run through other camper’s sites.  Bikes, scooters, and roller blades are not allowed on the walkway by the office or around the Riverside Patio & Guest Lounge (the Rio Room area).  Unaccompanied children are not permitted at the Riverside Pavilion, on the docks, or on the beach boardwalk / beach dune walkover.  For the safety of your family, all children should always be monitored and supervised closely while at any water front area of the resort and on the beach boardwalk, and when they are riding bikes, scooters or skateboards on the driveway and around the turn-around, and when in the dog park areas.   Your family’s safety is our number one concern!\n5.\tPets – We love pets at the Playa Del Rio and we are very pet-friendly.  However, it is important that your pets are well-behaved and that you follow all pet rules of the resort.  Playa Del Rio has three dog friendly areas in the resort.  Oscar Dog Park is on the West Side of the driveway near the entrance in front of the bathhouse; Sit-A-While Dog Park is on the East Side of the driveway across the drive from the bathhouse; and Sandy Hill Dog Walk is on the East Side of the driveway directly across the drive from the bathhouse.   The resort dog parks are not fenced dog parks, and are not parks where your pets can be off of their leash or allowed to run freely.   DO NOT use the Waterfront Pavilion (Riverside Patio and lawn area by the office and the Rio Room) or other RV sites other than your own site to allow pets to potty.   NO PETS are allowed on the grass, flower bed areas, or on the sandy areas past the circle turn around (the sandy areas, lawn and landscaped areas at the Riverside Patio, Riverside Jaxson Beach Sun Deck, and the Hammock Island) unless going to the docks.   The Riverside lawn, beach and patio areas at the Rio Room is a “people park” not a “dog park” and is reserved for family enjoyment.  You must always immediately clean up after your pets in all areas of the resort.  Do not leave pets unattended outside your RV at your site for the safety of your pets and others.  Pets are not allowed to roam and must remain on a leash (no more than 6’ long) and in your control at all times when on resort property (including when walking along the road side at the entrance and when walking along the beach side at the beach boardwalk).  Our insurance precludes aggressive breeds (e.g.:  Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, Dobermans, and other Wolf Breeds).  Escambia County ordinance requires all dogs to be on a leash at all times when in public commercial areas.   Pets are not allowed inside of any buildings (bath house, laundry room, office, or the Rio Room).  Our pet rules are for the benefit of all guests so that all campers and guests can enjoy their vacation.  Those who cannot follow the pet rules may be asked to leave, and there will be no refunds to anyone that is requested to leave the Playa Del Rio for not following our pet rules or any other resort rules, policies, procedures, and guidelines.\n6.\tCodes for Gates, Bathrooms, Laundry & WIFI Access – Access to certain amenity areas requires codes.  For codes to bathrooms, laundry room, WIFI and other secured areas, ask one of our Resort Camp Hosts in the office for current updated codes (the information changes, so always pick up the latest guest information package at the time of your check-in).  The bathhouse and laundry facilities are available 24-hours a day, seven days a week, for your convenience.  Quarters ($10 rolls) are available for purchase at the office for laundry during normal business hours.\n7.\tGeneral Guidelines & Rules – Our goal is to have a safe and peaceful resort that everyone can enjoy.  Please avoid profanity and disorderly conduct.  Please do not litter, including cigarette butts.  The trash dumpster is located in front of the bath house near the entrance (access is to the right of the gate and the dumpster has a sliding door directly on the side of the dumpster).  Please do not place your trash in the trash receptacles around the Riverside Patio, the office, or in the Rio Room; and in the event the dumpster gets full, please do not pile your trash on the ground in front of the dumpster or anywhere else on the property, but instead please notify the office.  Quiet hours in the park are from 10:00 pm (11:30 pm on the Riverside Patio & Guest Lounge – Rio Room) to 8:00 am.   No smoking is allowed in the office, rest rooms, laundry room, the Rio Room or on the Riverside Patio.  Please be courteous to others when smoking around the Riverside Patio and the River Front Pavilion.  NO open fires or charcoal grills are allowed at any sites.  Small gas fire pits may be used at your site, but must be pre-approved by management prior to any use.   Gas, propane and electric grills are allowed on your site, but you are responsible for properly cleaning and disposing of grease and debris from your grills (do not dispose of grease, oils and grill debris on the landscaping areas of your RV site, and always clean up drippings from under and around your grill).   Charcoal and Gas Grills are available at the grilling area for your use and enjoyment at the Riverside Patio; and guests are welcome to bring their own grills, smokers, cookers and other cooking equipment down to the Rio Room.  No Fireworks allowed.  No diving or jumping from the docks.  Swim at your own risk – No lifeguard on duty at Riverside or Gulf Side waters.  No tents or canopies are allowed unless they are attached vehicle accessories to your RV, Fifth Wheel or Travel Trailer.  All rental rates (for RV sites, Boat slips and other Watercraft slips) and other fees (such as late check-in, early check-in and late check-out fees) are quoted as base rental rates and charges, and will be charged an additional 7.5% or 11.5% tax for all applicable county and state required tax collections.   RV Site rental tax is 11.5%, Boat Slip rental tax is 7.5%, and tax on all other rentals, merchandise, and ice purchases is 7.5%.\n8.\tThe Owners, Management and Staff of Playa Del Rio are not liable for any loss of personal possessions, injuries to any occupants or their guests, regardless of age, or for any damage to any vehicles or personal equipment.
