Best clam chowder I've ever tasted!  And don't even get me started on how fresh the oysters are!!! Review by Yelp Tommy M.: Dropped in with a friend after running an errand. Not too busy nor noisy. Ordered fish and chips with a nice local stout that was on tap. Three nice pieces of cod lightly battered with seasoned fries and a small side of coleslaw... Review by Yelp kelly l.: Absolutely outstanding food we enjoyed a dozen East Coast oysters which were absolutely fresh and delicious we also had for West Coast oysters which are very good although I prefer the East Coast... Review by Yelp Linda B.: Delish! I had the beet salad and the presentation was wonderful plus it was so good. Then (because I am not a 'fishy' person) I had the Plain Jane smash burger...really good with little crispy edges! Husband had clam chowder that he said was very good and Maine lobster roll...

You can also style every aspect of this content in the module Design settings and even apply custom CSS to this text in the module Advanced settings. Where and at what stage do you invest? We invest in Pre-Seed, Seed and Series-A companies mainly in Europe. Do you have an industry or sector focus? We invest across the food value chain, from ag-tech and food-tech products & services to innovative and better-for-you food & beverage companies. How much money do you invest? We invest up to € 2 Mio in the first round with reserves for follow-on investments. We can typically allocate up to €5 – 7 Mio per portfolio company by bringing in key co-investing partners. When is the right time to approach you about investing? It is never too early to get in touch. We can decide together when it is the right timing for investment from our side. What are your investment criteria? The team is the centre of our attention. We are looking for founders who are ambitious, resourceful and resilient. Second is the product/service that has to positively impact society either through consumers’ health and/or environment. The third criteria are the total addressable market and product-market fit as we want to ensure that we build a large and successful company. What is your investment process, and how long does it take? We make sure the process is as fast and transparent as possible, as we know that every second spent on fundraising is a distraction from improving and building your product/service. The initial meeting and product samplings are the first touchpoints and important gateways after which we make most decisions. As a second step, we want you to meet everyone in our team and access all of your data to have a constructive and diverse discussion internally. How are you different from other VCs, and how do you support companies? We have first-hand operational and entrepreneurial experiences in the food & beverage sector and know what growing pains and challenges our founders face. We seek to be involved as much as we can and is required of us by our portfolio companies: we are as comfortable in getting involved on strategic matters at the board level as in operational items. Check our founder testimonials to see what real added value we provide, or reach out to our portfolio companies to hear about our input first hand. More Questions?

Let’s talk about your business TESTIMONIAL This is what our brands say The network from Oyster Bay is out of this world. They have played a key role in our successful Series-A round. Jannis – Air Up The best investor I could have hoped for. Always open for a sparring session and asking the right questions. Thanks. Felix – Purefood Without the experience brought to the table by Oyster Bay, we would not have dared to set up our own DACH sales organisation. But we did it, with great advise from Oyster Bay during the process. It was a critical business decision, but it turned out very well and we are very happy that we did it. Jacob – True Gum NO GRIT, NO PEARLS A natural pearl begins its life inside an oyster’s shell when a grain of sand slips in between one of the two shells of an oyster.

The cold water temperatures of both our Atlantic Northeast and the Pacific Northwest coast lines, slow down the metabolism, producing slightly crisp, sweeter oysters ; expect meatier oysters with more saltiness as you make your way south down both our east and west coasts. Fish that makes colder water it's home, also carries a higher fat content. Always rich in Omega-3 and other essential nutrients. Adam & Erin Nardis put forward their years of experience owning and running restaurants in coastal communities, to bring their passion to Ft. Myers, Florida. They spent years manning the helm and the iconic National Hotel on Block Island, Rhode Island, and then migrating to Florida's southwest coast. Sourcing the freshest cold -water seafood has become a way of life for our team. Please join us as we create a unique environment to eat the freshest oysters, clams, lobster, and crab legs in a casual, family like environment! \"IF YOU TIPTOE INTO COLD WATER, YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON THE RUSH OF PLUNGING IN HEADFIRST\" -Simone Elkeles- Contact us: by phone (239)-220-5918, by email adam@coldwateroystermarket.com Order Reserve Parties Catering Jobs"
