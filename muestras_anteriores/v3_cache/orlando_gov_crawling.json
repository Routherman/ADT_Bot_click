This is refundable only if canceled by March 5th and is NOT transferable to another year. Your total balance is due on May 1st.

One of the original parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the park provides a pastoral setting amid rolling hills, open meadows and woodlands of the Beargrass Creek valley. For vehicles on the Scenic Loop (or recreational users moving in the direction of vehicle traffic), the secret to navigating the park is to keep turning left to stay in the park, or keep turning right to leave the park.

Peeler, Jr. South Carolina Senate The Honorable Harvey S. Peeler, Jr. South Carolina Senate Harvey Smith Peeler, Jr. was elected to the South Carolina Senate and began his service to the people of Senate District 14 in November 1980. District 14 is comprised of his home county of Cherokee, along with portions of Spartanburg, Union and York Counties. Now, after 38 years of service in the South Carolina Senate, Peeler sits as the third most senior senator. Following the 2005 legislative session, Senator Peeler accepted the position of Majority Leader of the Senate of South Carolina. This historic honor was bestowed upon him by his fellow Republican Senators and in doing so Peeler became only the second South Carolina Republican to be named Senate Majority Leader since the end of the Reconstruction Era. He served as Majority Leader until he resigned that position in March 2015. In January 2005, Peeler was appointed chairman of the Senate Medical Affairs Committee, a position he still holds today. During his time as chairman, the Senate has been able to pass significant legislation of the reform of medical practice in South Carolina. Prior to his appointment as Medical Affairs Committee Chairman, Peeler was head of the Senate Fish, Game and Forestry Committee for five years. Aside from his committee chairmanship, Senator Peeler is heavily involved in the inner workings of the Senate. In 2007, he was appointed as vice-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In addition to Medical Affairs and Finance, Peeler is currently a member of the Senate Education, Ethics, Interstate Cooperation, and Transportation committees. He also chairs both the State House Committee and the College and University Board of Trustees Screening Committee, and serves on the Joint Bond Review Committee, and the Senate Operations and Management Committee. As a member of the State House Committee, Peeler and other legislators were charged with overseeing the most extensive renovation of the State House since its construction. The project was completed and the State House reopened to visitors in August 1998. The South Carolina General Assembly held its first session in the refurbished State House in 1999. Over the years, numerous groups have recognized Senator Peeler for his dedicated service to the state of South Carolina and its people. The South Carolina Business and Industry Political Education Committee (BIPEC) acknowledged him for his exceptional support of the business community in both 1996 and 1998. Also in 1996, the South Carolina School Boards Association named him one of three Outstanding Legislators, and Lake Wylie, South Carolina named him as the “Citizen of the Year”. Senator Peeler was honored as “Legislator of the Year” by the South Carolina Poultry Federation in 1996, and by the South Carolina Rural Water Association in 1999. The South Carolina Association of Taxpayers honored him with the “Friend of the Taxpayer Award” in 2003 and 2013. The South Carolina Department of Education in 2005 recognized Peeler for his outstanding contributions to public education. In 2011, the American Legion Department of South Carolina presented him with their Special Legislative Award in appreciation for his many years of outstanding service to his community, state and nation. Thanks to his leadership and pro-business approach in the Senate, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Peeler its “2007 Public Servant of the Year”. His dedication to the State has also been recognized by both the Medical University of South Carolina and Clemson University, which bestowed upon him honorary doctoral degrees in 2008 and 2009, respectively. For his leadership in insuring South Carolina’s foster children have easy access to education, Peeler received the 2010 “Legislator of the Year” award from the South Carolina Association of Children’s Homes and Family Services. That same year, 2010, Spartanburg Community College named their academic building on the Cherokee County Campus the Harvey S. Peeler, Jr. Academic Building. Senator Peeler and his wife, the former Donna Caudill, are the proud parents of three children: Brantlee Peeler Morgan, H. Smith Peeler, III, and Boone, and seven grandchildren. He is the son of the late H. Smith Peeler and Sally Bratton Peeler of Gaffney. A lifelong dairyman and businessman in Cherokee County, Peeler and his family are active members of Gaffney First Baptist Church. He is both a Mason and a Shriner. Prior to his election to the South Carolina Senate, he was a member of the Cherokee County Council from 1977-1980. Peeler also served as a lieutenant in the United States Army. In 1970, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Clemson University.
