We provide the support that survivors of sexual and domestic violence and human trafficking need to overcome their crisis and transform their lives. We believe in supporting each client without judgment, helping them normalize their reactions and feelings related to their experiences. Our approach is client-centered and trauma-informed, acknowledging that the survivor is the expert on their own experiences and understands what choices are safest for themselves and their family. Our goal is to help clients understand and address the impact of trauma and build resilience. All services are available in English and Spanish and at no cost to the survivor regardless of race, gender, age, national origin, income, immigration status, gender identity or expression, faith, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, and geographic location. We are open to all. We serve all. Our services include individual counseling and support groups for adult and children/youth, emergency shelter, court advocacy, hospital accompaniment, 24-hour helpline and community outreach and education. We are committed to transforming the lives of survivors, by helping those who have been impacted by violence and abuse to heal, rebuild, and move forward with their lives. In 1998 representatives of Bon Secours, Henrico County and other key partners met to address the shortage of shelter beds and support services in Henrico County for domestic violence victims. We opened our doors in April 2000 as an emergency shelter to provide safe housing for victims of domestic violence in imminent danger. While Henrico County is our primary service area for sexual and domestic violence services, we provide services to sex and labor trafficking survivors throughout the state.
