Our voices will be the talk that backs up our walk. The purpose of having a shocking and clever attitude is to stand out amongst our competitors, but not scare people away. With witty banter and open arms, Staypineapple will create “Remember that one time when…” moments. Michelle Barnet Chief Pineapple Officer Michelle Barnet Chief Pineapple Officer College University of Nevada, Hospitality Business Management, BS Mascot Rebels Favorite fruit Truly is a pineapple Favorite Quote ”You'll see it when you believe it” – Dr. Wayne Dyer My thing After spending 20 ish years in both the business of Hospitality and the acquisition and development of Real Estate, combining them seemed like a great next step. Pineapple hospitality, its assets, its mission, but mostly its people are my pride and joy manifested. I am privileged to work with what I believe is a best in class group of hospitality professionals who know their stuff, but most importantly bring their hearts and integrity to the work of enhancing the pineapple vision every day. We are unified around the single idea that hotels aren't places ...they are experiences. From this \"core\" belief grows Pineapple each day.Without the love and support of my husband Steve and son Max none of the above would be possible. Oh and let's not forget the laughter and love that comes from our two furry family members Dash and Kiska the Pineapple huskies. Dina Belon President Mike Hirschler Chief Growth Officer Casey Dill Chief Financial Officer Bob Spear Chief Operating Officer Dina Belon President College Florida State University, B.S. Interior Design Mascot Seminoles Favorite fruit Key lime but just for the pie… Favorite Quote “Be the change you wish to see in the world” - Ghandi My thing I have been making waves for more than 20 years in the hospitality industry, bucking the traditional; focused on creating unique, extraordinary, and sustainable hotels. I began my career in design, transitioned into development and construction, evolved into engineering and operations, and eventually pulled it all together into a multidisciplinary hospitality leader. I am responsible for the people and the buildings at Pineapple Hospitality, making sure the stage is set for Pineapple’s amazing team to inspire out of the ordinary experiences.... really an Oscar-winning performance. I met my husband at work over 20 years ago and our favorite past time is architecture of all types, fat, skinny, tall short, old and new; we love them all. We have two beautiful rescue cats and a dog, Molly, Mookie, and Bella. We live on a \"hobby farm\" with plans to expand the four legged family, maybe a horse or a donkey in our future. Mike Hirschler Chief Growth Officer College Cornell University, School of Hotel Administration Mascot Big Red Bear Favorite fruit A Hazy IPA from Reuben’s Brews (with a hint of Pineapple) Favorite Quote “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” – Warren Buffett My thing A hotelier at heart since I was a young child, my passion is supporting the people who make it happen every day for our guests. During more than 20 years in the hospitality industry, my career has taken me across the United States with brands like Fairmont and Four Seasons. With a background in recruiting, learning and development and project management, I am excited to collaborate to build Staypineapple’s people leadership strategy. I am crazy about my community and believe we have a social responsibility to make an impact. My proudest accomplishment is partnering with the Pediatric Brain Tumor Research Fund to create the Run of Hope, the most successful grassroots fundraising event for Seattle Children’s Hospital. Like many in our business, when I get away…I like to get away! I love to travel to unique destinations, experience great restaurants and sample amazing wine. If you time it right, you might find me enjoying a craft beer at Reuben’s Brews in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle with my partner, Starrla, and our rescue pup, Sadie. Casey Dill Chief Financial Officer College Central Washington University, Degree – Accounting, Minor – Computer Applications Mascot Wildcats Favorite fruit Banana – go to fruit for an athlete Favorite Quote “The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person’s determination.” – Tommy Lasorda My thing With over 24 years of accounting and finance experience, I joined Pineapple Hospitality in 2015 after holding accounting & finance roles in aerospace, software, manufacturing, and distribution industries. I have a passion for numbers, organization, and analytics which comes partly from being a self proclaimed baseball statistician. Washington native, born on Whidbey Island, raised in Kirkland, and proud CWU alumni. Financial statements, treasury & risk management, data analyzing, report preparing, budget developing, numbers guru - BY DAY. Husband, dad (of four amazing children), coach, mentor, board member, community volunteer, golfer, fisherman, and Northwest traveler - BY NIGHT / WEEKEND. Bob Spear Chief Operating Officer College University of Maryland Eastern Shore Mascot Golden Eagles Favorite fruit Watermelon Favorite Quote Never say never because limits, like fears, are often just illusions. -Michael Jordan My thing I am passionate about building teams and being a part of teams that come together to produce outstanding results. The selfless nature of wanting others to enjoy their time while staying at our wonderful Staypineapple hotels makes every day a fulfilling journey. Each and every day provides the opportunity to put a smile on someone’s face whether it be a guest who has traveled from afar or a team member who has earned a pat on the back. My 25 year career with Marriott provided me with the knowledge and passion for the industry that I brought with me to Pineapple Hospitality. Being able to work in a creative environment without limits or boundaries allows us to live and speak Pineapple. Truly hospitality redefined! Pineapple Hospitality has brought my wife, two daughters and our 10 year old boxer to the PNW. Randall Obrecht Vice President of People & Culture Robin Koetje Vice President of Information Technology Austin Gardner Vice President of Distribution and Development Casey Barks Vice President of Marketing Tony Ledesma Director of Finance Randall Obrecht Vice President of People & Culture College Mascot Favorite fruit Strawberries Favorite Quote “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take” -Wayne Gretzky My thing I bring over 30 years of experience in hospitality food and beverage and operations. My career in the Seattle culinary scene has allowed me the opportunity to work with James Beard award-winning chefs, fulfill strategic leadership roles for restaurant corporations like Ruth Chris, Restaurants Unlimited, and Savor, and oversee McCaw Hall, a 3,000 seat performing arts hall. I moved into operations while working for Benchmark Hospitality as a General Manager for the historic Sorrento Hotel. I joined Pineapple Hospitality in the Fall of 2016, where I started in a food & beverage leadership role and then transitioned into Operations. I support the hotel teams in every way, being the liaison with Pineapple headquarters, providing answers on any topics as well as filling in at the hotels during key moments. I do my best to exemplify the spirit of Redefining Hospitality and assist in upholding expectations for our hotels by mentoring, training, and guiding the hotel teams in delivering upon those expectations. When I am not working in the world of Pineapple, I enjoy exploring new restaurants, playing tennis, and doing just about anything with my son. Robin Koetje Vice President of Information Technology College University of Washington Mascot Huskies Favorite fruit Grapes, because they are the most fun to eat, like candy or popcorn. Favorite Quote \"Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.\" - Calvin from 'Calvin and Hobbes' My thing Technology in hospitality has been my thing since around 2000, right about when everyone thought technology was going to be the doom of us all with the Y2K glitch, which is likely not a coincidence.   I've enjoyed seeing IT grow and evolve in the industry, and I look forward to the exciting things we are going to be able to do as we continue to march through the 21st century.  Having been working in hotel management my whole career, I have been through a number of projects opening hotels, taking over ownership and management of hotels, and implementing new systems for properties and clients. I enjoy a good motorcycle ride on a curvy mountain road, crushing my kids playing video games on the Xbox or Nintendo Switch, and traveling with my wife and family to new places.  I play guitar poorly but passionately, and can bake a pretty darn good loaf of bread.  Love our Seattle sports teams and bleed purple for my Washington Huskies.  Go Dawgs! Austin Gardner Vice President of Distribution and Development College University of Wyoming Mascot Pistol Pete Favorite fruit Anything, as long as it’s in a cocktail! Favorite Quote Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. - Ralph Waldo Emerson My thing Growing up on a Wyoming cattle ranch taught me the value of hard work, but I yearned for something more than hay bales and horseshoes. Even as a kid, I had a passion for adventure and travel, incessantly hounding my parents about our next road trip. It seems truly fitting that my childhood wanderlust would guide me toward a career in hospitality, where I've accumulated 13 years of experience in upscale sales and marketing. And I still made time to collect passport stamps from 24 countries along the way! Fast forward to today where I am thrilled to be looking for the next adventure with the Staypineapple team, redefining hospitality across the country. When I'm not working, you can catch me lounging poolside with my better half and our pint-sized pooch. And when we’re not relaxing? We're planning our next real estate investment move, or scheming a Shark Tank worthy side hustle. Casey Barks Vice President of Marketing College Northern Arizona University Mascot Go the Gorilla Favorite fruit PNW Cider (fermented apple juice is fruit, right?) Favorite Quote \"Your body is not a temple. It's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.\" - Anthony Bourdain My thing As the product of a journalist mother, I grew up surrounded by the power of storytelling and the written word. During my college years, I spent my evenings serving tables in fine dining restaurants and my days taking communications and marketing courses at Northern Arizona University, with the hopes of one day combining these two passions into a career. 15 years and six cities later (San Francisco to Seattle to Austin to Vancouver to Salem to Bellevue), I now have the opportunity to share Staypineapple's fun and playful story with the world. When not writing press releases and creating social media strategies, you can find me with my amazing wife and adorable fur-baby discovering our next favorite Pacific Northwest adventure. Tony Ledesma Director of Finance College Washington State University Mascot Cougars Favorite fruit Watermelon Favorite Quote \"Every strike brings me closer to the next home run\" - Babe Ruth My thing I’ve lived in the Pacific Northwest my whole life and have been in the hotel industry since I was 18. I grew up in West Seattle and, after attending college in Pullman, I jumped right into my career with Staypineapple—where I’ve now been for over a decade. I genuinely love working with people and have a deep passion for numbers and data, and through digging into the details, whether it’s financial reporting, budgeting, or analytics, I’ve had the rewarding experience of contributing to and watching the company grow. When I’m not working, I love spending time outdoors and staying active—whether that’s walking, hiking, running, or golfing. I’m also a big sports fan (especially baseball), so you’ll often find me catching a Mariners game or out coaching our company softball team!

      "text": "About Us: The Story of Pineapple & Pineapple Products ABOUT JOIN US CONTACT What We Do We create innovative health supplements and brands combined with strong partnerships and unique stories. Today, people want products with purpose and relationship with people, not just an object. By knowing the person behind the product, they know what they believe in and why it matters. While these products might appear under different brand-names, Pineapple is the “parent company” that creates, markets and oversees these smaller brands. How We’re Different We combine new Pineapple Products with unique partnerships. These partnerships have included influencers, doctors and personalities who have a unique story to tell about health. We make sure our Pineapple Products and the stories behind them are unique, inspiring and cannot be found anywhere else - this is our advantage. We pride ourselves in making products we’d buy ourselves but can’t find on any store shelf. Products we know other people would love too, if they only existed. Our Future As we grow, we continue to expand the number of brands and Pineapple Products we offer. Many customers love our brands and want more products and content from them - and we’re doing our best, hiring new people every month, to try to provide it. We also work to make our products available to more countries and more people. So we are expanding our reach and advertising in every possible medium to make an impact. If you share our passion, and think you'd be a great fit to bring our products to people in need of big solutions, see about joining our team of \"A Players\" to help further our mission. Company History Here is our story and how we grew to what we are today. LOCAL CLASSROOM EVENTS 2011 2 Employees We started grassroots in New York City hosting educational events on popular topics, booking sought-after speakers and organizing seminars. ONLINE COURSES 2013 4 Employees As the demand for local courses grew, we started selling these courses online. The depth and detail of the courses grew, as did our marketing and advertising skills, growing the company from a small side project to a large company with customers worldwide. MEN'S HEALTH MARKET 2016 16 Employees After noticing our customers wanted more health information, we decided to formulate our first supplement with help from experts. Joining the “Men's Health” market followed us to boost the sales of the company. PROBIOTICS AND BEYOND 2018 32 Employees We moved into a larger market, creating a unique probiotic formula with unique strains linked to better metabolism. This new move increased revenue again, and is a strong enough base to grow the company for years. THE FUTURE 2020+ AND BEYOND 40 Employees We seek to grow our company by making our products more visible in more places while expanding our product lines and entering new markets, with making an impact on health of 7X more people. Our Brands Have Been Featured In... Our events and Pineapple Products have been covered by a number of newspapers and publications.

We offer innovative software and business solutions for both B2B and B2C. Starting out in the financial sector, we have taken our successful business functions and used these across a variety of platforms. We are a dynamic team that thrives on innovation and improving our processes wherever possible, to deliver positive outcomes for our customers at all times. As we have grown as a business, we have endeavoured to ensure that we never stray from this philosophy. Big Golden Pineapple is always striving for more, which is evidenced by our amazing customer feedback, in addition to industry recognition from esteemed awards bodies. Our Philosophy The Best Outcome Isn’t Always The Simplest One We are always striving for the correct outcome, whether it be for our customers, staff or stakeholders. The path may not be the easiest one, but we’re not afraid of a bit of hard work. Transforming Innovation Into Value Innovation isn’t always enough in business. We create with purpose. We don’t want to be the biggest company, but the best, and streamline our processes to reflect this. Own The Problem, Share The Solution We’re all human and make mistakes. Regardless of whose mess it is, we’ll share the work cleaning it up. We know that we can achieve more working together to solve a problem. Suits Don’t Make You Think Smarter Dressing smartly won’t improve your intellect. Why wear a stuffy suit, when you can be comfortable in your wardrobe? Working hard is more important than dressing to impress. Fulfilment Through The Challenge We don’t like to sit idle. We’re fast paced and brimming with creative ideas. So we are constantly challenging ourselves to strive for more. The Right People Achieve The Right Result We don’t hire people just to increase our numbers. If you’re working in the right company, in the right role, there is no end to what you can achieve. The Meaning Behind Big Golden Pineapple I have always had a penchant for pineapples. I like the way they taste, the way they look, and that they have an interesting history, being considered ‘luxury’ in Europe in the 17th to 19th centuries. In December 2015, when we were running award winning Fintech business DJS (UK) Limited, my eldest son bought me a model of a golden pineapple for my desk. Three days after he gave it to me, we became the first HCSTC lender to receive full authorisation from the FCA. From that point on, the business grew from strength to strength, going up against the big players in the industry and outshining them all. That golden pineapple became a symbol of good fortune for me, and has sat prominently on every desk I’ve manned, as a reminder of where we’d grown from. When DJS (UK) Limited went into administration, I knew we would need a little bit of luck to take another start up to that level of success. I’d always associated that little golden pineapple with a change in our fortunes. And did you know that pineapples have the incredible power of regeneration? With the right care and focus, the discarded leafy top of the fruit can be used to grow a whole new pineapple. To grow again from something small into something bountiful was exactly what I had in mind for my team and my next business venture. And so, Big Golden Pineapple was born. DAN WARE FOUNDER OF BIG GOLDEN PINEAPPLE Our team are award winning professionals with a wealth of knowledge and experience. We all wear many hats and are dedicated in the pursuit of success. Dan Ware CEO Ramzi Al-Masri CFO Rob Samuel Commercial Director Sam Baxter Head of Business Relations and HR Pete Tonkin Business Intelligence Danny Hobbs Audit & Quality Manager The team behind Big Golden Pineapple (BGP) began as the award-winning Fintech firm, DJS (UK) Limited, founded in 2012. Under DJS (UK) Limited, founded and then scaled by key BGP members, we launched one of the UK’s leading high-cost short-term credit lenders, PiggyBank. We had a vision to do things differently, and lead the way for the rest of the industry. PiggyBank was the first high-cost short-term credit lender to be fully authorised by the FCA in 2015, and won a host of awards along the way. We did it all ourselves, building our own state of the art end-to-end solution that meant we could run at optimum efficiency. PiggyBank went from a handful of staff in a small office, to having more than 80 staff providing over 12,000 new loans and servicing 37,000 outstanding loans monthly, thanks to the work of our dedicated team and the adaptable product the tech and ops teams collaboratively created. In 2019, the industry underwent a huge regulatory overhaul, which saw many lenders unable to continue operating. We fought as hard as we could, but with the new rules implemented by the FCA, even though we were able to tailor our procedures in line with the FCA’s recommendations, Piggybank was no longer a commercially viable proposition, and with heavy hearts, we had to close its doors. Even though we no longer had a lender, we had our technology, our team, our group innovation and determination. And so we looked to the future, and saw nothing but opportunity on the horizon. OUR JOURNEY SO FAR The Big Golden Pineapple family is made up of several versatile and talented individuals. We are the definition of small but mighty. As a collective, we each bring something unique and powerful to the table, and our individual skills are never underappreciated or underutilised in our perpetual quest for continuous improvement and organisational efficiency. We are always looking towards the horizon to see how we can do better, and we push ourselves and each other to constantly reach that next goal or target. Over years of working with each other, we’ve optimised our approach to enable tight communication and peak efficiency, with everyone firmly focused on a common goal. The result is an outstanding team ready to take any challenge head on. This has meant that we’ve been able to operate on a business as usual basis throughout the global pandemic, shifting between our office space and working from home seamlessly, a feat that thousands of businesses across every industry have unfortunately struggled with. Something we’re particularly proud of was our ability to set up our remote call centre. We saw other businesses forced to switch to email or live chat only contact with their customers, whereas we were able to continue to deliver world leading customer service across all channels, to make sure we continue to deliver the right outcomes to our customers.
