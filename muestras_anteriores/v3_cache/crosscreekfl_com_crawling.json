Our golf course was built in 1987 and renovated in 2002 and the greens, fairways, tees, and bunkers were all renovated between 2012 and 2015. Our signature holes have been featured in magazines and books throughout the years. Cross Creek is an executive style course and can be challenging from the back tees but for those beginning their golf career a little later in life the course can be made easier by moving up in the tee box. The panoramic views offered by the course are often breathtaking and integrate the surrounding native landscape and wildlife.

Play the ball as it lies unless the rules state otherwise. Embedded ball: Anywhere “through the green” a ball which is embedded in its own pitch-mark in the ground, may be lifted without penalty, cleaned and dropped as near as possible to the spot where it lay but no nearer the hole.  “Through the green” is any area from tee to putting surface (except all bunkers and hazards). Lateral Hazards: All water hazards here at Cross Creek are Lateral Hazards, and marked with red stakes or red painted lines.  If your ball lies in or touched the Hazard line the ball is considered to be in the Hazard. Cypress trees are on hole #8 is now considered a Lateral Hazard.  If the Player is unsure if the ball is in or out of the Hazard the Player may hit a Provisional ball from the tee or the drop area.  If the original ball is found outside the Hazard line that ball must be played.  If the ball is found inside the Hazard line the Player has the option to play the original ball or the Provisional ball. Options: ( 1 ) You may play another ball from the original spot.  ( 2 ) You may drop a ball within two club lengths from the last point of entry no nearer the hole.  (3) You may play the ball as it lies from the Hazard (No penalty if ball is played from hazard). (4) You may also take a drop as far back as you like keeping the point of entry and the pin in a straight line.  (5) You may also use the drop area. Drop Areas: Drop areas may be used whenever a ball is hit into a Lateral Hazard.  Ball may be placed. Coquina Shell Cart Paths: Holes #1, #11 and #16 play as the ball lies. Flower beds and new plantings: All flower beds are to be played as ground under repair, nearest point of relief no closer to the hole and one club length (No Penalty).  This includes; The Plantings on the right side of the cart path on #18.  Flower bed right of the green behind the bunker #17, all plantings on the left side of the fairway #16 and #13 beyond the green.  Flower bed to the right side of #12 Green. Pine Straw – Free relief from pine straw, nearest point of relief then one club length no closer to the hole.  If straw in in the hazard follow hazard relief. Out of Bounds: O.B. is defined by white stakes, white lines or street curbs (on #6, #7 & #12).  If you hit the ball Out of Bounds you may take a one shot penalty and hit again from the original spot.  You may re-tee the ball on the tee box with a stroke and distance penalty.  The player may also take a two stroke penalty and drop in the fairway from a position no closer to the pin from where the ball last crossed the OB stakes (If a provisional has been played the player can not use the two shot penalty drop in the fairway). Lost Ball: Stroke and distance, ball must be replayed from original spot.  Player may choose to play a provisional ball. Cart Path Only Holes: Holes that are roped off Tee to Green will be played as Lift Clean and Place. Unusually Wet Areas: We have a few areas that stay wet year round (Example #1, #3, #10, #11, #15, #16, #17 & #18).  When a ball is hit into an area where there is no casual water but the area is soft/muddy the player may move the ball during league play with consent from the other players in the group(if it is outside Red or White stakes) to an area no closer to the hole where the ground is firm/normal (No Penalty). Doubt of Procedure: During the round a player may announce that s/he is going to play a second ball in case there is doubt on a ruling or local rule situation.  The player must score both balls and then get a ruling from the rules committee before signing the card. Revised 2/7/2019 HANDICAP FLAG PROGRAM (ADA Policy) The Cross Creek Pro Shop policy for Handicap Flags for golf carts is offered to those individuals who, for medical reasons, will benefit from their use. A golfer who submits a valid handicap-parking permit from any government agency, or a note from a licensed physician, may be registered under this Program and be extended certain benefits for that specific day depending upon course conditions. All golfers with a disability who request use of a Handicap Flag MUST complete the registration form. By signing the registration form, the golfer agrees to abide by the rules and regulations set forth below for Handicap Flag use. The Handicap Flag privilege may be suspended or revoked, with or without warning, for abuse or violation of any of the Rules detailed below. RULES OF THE FLAG 1. The Handicap Golf Cart may be driven up to 15 feet from the tee box or green but must NEVER be driven or parked on the tee box or green at any time or under any condition. 2. When conditions warrant and the course has been designated as Cart Path Only, ALL golfers including those with Handicap Flags must adhere to Cart Path Only restrictions. 3. If the Cart Path Only rule is limited to selected holes, the Handicap Privilege does NOT extend to those holes so designated. 4. The Handicap Flag applies only to the individual(s) with the disability. If more than one disabled person is in the group, they must ride in the same cart. 5. An able-bodied golfer in the cart with a disabled golfer MAY NOT take advantage of the Handicap Flag Policy and must walk to his or her ball. 6. The 90-degree rule applies. 7. Parking carts on slopes/surrounds of any green or tee box is prohibited. 8. Ranger/Starter observation of a Rule violation or if a person is abusive, may result in golf privileges being suspended or revoked. A sullied copy of this form is kept on file by the Pro Shop. Revised 03/01/2025 Handicap Flag Registration Form (Click to view or print form) GOLF COURSE DRESS CODE Proper attire, as recommended by Management and as approved by the Board of Directors, is always required on the golf course or the practice putting green.

No matter where we meet or how many people call Cross Creek home, that doesn’t change. Where we come from Cross Creek started with small groups meeting in homes, and developed into a core group that founded the church. We’ve met in various locations — from a karate dojo and bowling alley to a former funeral home and the custom-built space we currently enjoy. Our first public service was in the Garlock House building, in November 1994. Our pastor, David Prince, joined us the following June and we moved to the Vienna Street location in July of 1996.

Situated at the foot of the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, the club has been in operation since 1973. “The landscape here is truly breath taking, and it provides our members with a quiet atmosphere for enjoying their time spent with friends and family,” said Shannon Waters, General Manager of Cross Creek. “We offer a semi-private 18-hole golf course which accommodates members and their guests as well as daily fee golfers. Cross Creek is also known for fine cuisine, social activities, charity events, and a variety of athletic facilities, including swimming and tennis.” The Cross Creek property was originally a working farm owned by H.O. Woltz, Sr. The farm produced tobacco and corn and raised beef cattle. At one time it also included a commercial flower growing operation which supplied gladiola, jonquil, and tulips to wholesalers throughout the east coast. Later, after acquiring additional acreage adjacent to the farm, Mr. Woltz envisioned that the site would provide a beautiful setting for a first-class country club and golf course. Woltz believed such a club would have a positive economic impact on Mt. Airy, while enhancing quality of life for residents. Woltz, along with fellow investors Richard Vaughn, Zack Blackmon, Sr., Lindsay Holcomb, Jr., Smith Holcomb, Kilbourn Henry, Ed Crossingham, and Don Porter contracted with Joseph Lee, a well known and highly respected golf course architect to help them design and develop the new country club. The consulting firm of Martini and Associates was also brought in to assist with design of the club and surrounding residential developments. Cross Creek Country Club officially opened in 1973 featuring a 6,800-yard golf course designed by Joe Lee. The clubhouse was completely renovated in 2001 to include a well-appointed interior and Grand Ballroom which has become the centerpiece of the region’s social scene. Improvements were made to the golf course in 2005 under the guidance of Greensboro-based architect Kris Spence, and a three-season pavilion was added in 2007 which has since become a popular venue for dining, dancing, parties, and musical entertainment. The improvements were noted by North Carolina Business magazine who named Cross Creek one of the top 100 golf courses in the State. In October of 2020, Skip and Cathy Eckenrod, former owners of Interlam Inc., a manufacturer of architectural wall panels and design elements, purchased Cross Creek Country Club. Skip and Cathy are making ongoing significant investments for capital improvements, renovations and upgrades, including a new roof for the clubhouse and pool. The club’s in-house restaurant has also been renovated and renamed ‘The Sunset Grille’.” The Club’s GM brought in PGA Head Golf Professional, Kent Shumate, as well as Chef Josh Greenberg. Kent Shumate joined the club from Olde Beau Resort & Golf Club. Previously, he served twenty-four years at Mount Airy Country Club as the PGA Head Golf Professional. Chef Greenberg most recently worked in South Florida where he also received formal training at Le Cordon Bleu in Miami and specialized in fresh seafood dishes. And while there have been many changes and improvements, the Eckenrods and their team have continued the traditions of fine dining and recreational excellence that Cross Creek Country Club has been known for. Skip and Cathy have also kept alive the dream of H.O. Woltz who envisioned a first-class Country Club that enhances the community, supports economic growth, and brings enjoyment to the residents of Mount Airy, Surry County, and surrounding areas. Today Cross Creek Country Club has over 300 members, and provides a venue for unique Member Events, high school proms, reunions, community banquets, corporate retreats and meetings, charity events, weddings, and receptions. Cross Creek Country Club is located at 1129 Greenhill Road in Mount Airy, North Carolina. For more information, call (336) 789-5193.

Remember, when visiting a Reciprocal Club, you must carry your membership card at all times. The Reciprocal Program is a tremendous undertaking for every club’s staff.  Our main goal is to accommodate everyone’s requests.  Help us help you!  Please assist us in securing your reciprocal requests at the other clubs by following the following procedures: Fill out the Reciprocal Request Sheet in the Golf Shop (No Phone Requests Please). List the courses that you would like to play (The first one being the desired course). Date and time of play. List the Members and or Guests playing that day. Make sure to leave a call back phone number. Golf Staff Employees will call the Course or Courses chosen determined by the rules that the Reciprocal Clubs have sent us. No exceptions. A Member should never call a Reciprocal Golf Course directly unless they wish to pay the Public Rate. Violations may lead to suspension of Reciprocal Privileges. Please be flexible . During the very popular first three weeks in May and the last three weeks in October, please provide us with three different course options.  Please realize that in many cases there are more than 20 clubs competing to secure the same tee times we are requesting.  Also, requests for multiple times are more difficult to secure. Familiarize yourself with dress code and other restrictions (ex: spike less facility, no denim, etc.) of the reciprocal Club. Cargo Shorts are not allowed at most clubs now. Confirm your tee time requests .  Call the golf shop to confirm they received tee time reservations.  Please note many clubs restrict morning play for their members, so consider an alternate time or course. Please remember to take care of the reciprocal club’s bag attendants, a buck or two goes a long way . Remember that we are considered Guests whenever we are playing at another Golf Course. 2025 Summer Reciprocals:  Please fill out a Reciprocal Request Form if you would like to play outside CCCC.   Most of the Clubs on the 2025 list are blocking their T-Sheets From 7:00 am to 10:00 am (for their Member’s). This list will be updated as Clubs return their reciprocal information.
