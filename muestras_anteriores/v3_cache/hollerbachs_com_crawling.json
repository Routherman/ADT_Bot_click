Naturally, our focus is always on imported German products – beer and wine from over 50 German breweries and wineries, chocolate, Gummi bears, dry goods, condiments, and many other products from familiar brands such as Haribo, Ritter Sport, Knorr, Löwensenf, Maggi, etc. – but we also feature in-house prepared meats, a full-service bakery, a lunch counter with a wide assortment of meats and cheeses from quality vendors, a frozen meat section, even some produce…the diversity of products in our little German deli and shop surprises even us sometimes. 😊 So drop in sometime for a bottle of beer and a freshly-prepared deli sandwich, pick up a few things to make your own German meals at home, or maybe just have an espresso and a piece of homemade Black Forest Cake while you’re out exploring Sanford’s Historic District – all of it served with a side of Hollerbach Gemütlichkeit!

Author Hollerbachs Posted on January 5, 2018 January 5, 2018 Categories German Traditions Featured German Immersion Night at the Willow Tree – second Tuesday of every month! Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? Lots of people want to improve their German language skills but have no way to practice. At our monthly German Immersion Night , we provide a fun and festive environment for people who are learning German to socialize with other Germanophiles while enjoying German food and beverage (as you can see, that’s a lot of German going on!) This event is just perfect for brushing up on your greetings, ordering food and drinks, and learning new vocabulary from native speakers, including our staff! German Immersion Night began in March and is held on the second Tuesday of every month. Join us for dinner, drinks, German chit-chat, and even an appearance by Orlando’s Schuhplattler Gruppe Alpenrose folk-dancing group. Not sure if this night is for you? Everyone has different reasons for learning a new language, but if you fall into any of the following categories, you will love German Immersion Night: You’re taking a trip to Germany Ah, lucky you! Germany is a beautiful country, and although most people there do speak English (and quite well!), the natives really appreciate it when visitors make an effort to speak their language. At Immersion Night, you can practice ordering in German and work on the pronunciation of different dishes and beers. Since many of our German-speaking staff will be working, you may even get some travel tips for the regions you plan to visit! You are in a German group or class Did you know that German is the third most popular language students take in school, right behind Spanish and French? Take a break from your formal language course with a little casual speaking practice! The more you speak, the more fluent your German will become, especially as you learn new idioms and turns of phrase that make your speech more natural and less stiff. Our staff and other German pros can clue you into new phrases and maybe even some (age appropriate) slang! You just started dating a German Is there a more noble reason to learn a language than love? Communicate with your Schatzi a little better by learning his or her native tongue! You can come to Immersion Night and pick up a few special phrases to impress your sweetheart, or bring him or her along so she can teach you herself while you enjoy a German date night. This is a great motivation to learn…just ask our server Troy! You ARE German and you want to help others Most German guests we’ve met love to help us with our German language skills, teaching our staff new vocabulary and phrases. If this sounds like you, we would love to hear your voice at Immersion Night! The more German speakers, the better. We know that sometimes after living in the US for years, you start to speak English more than your mother tongue, but you can reverse that trend when you join us for this event, all while challenging German students to up their game. You can tell stories about your region of Germany, talk about your favorite German dishes, or even tell some German jokes! No matter your reason for joining us on German Immersion Night, we know you’ll have a great time! The more participants we have, the more educational and fun the experience will be for everyone. You can email us or reach out through social media for additional questions. Please contact Reservations@Hollerbachs.com for parties of 6 people or more.

Last week, Theo showed me a newsletter and Christmas postcard he gets every year from the Selbach-Oster people, and told me something I didn’t know: most of us associate Germany with white wines, like the Selbach Mosel Riesling selection we carry, but red wine – Pinot Noir ( Spätburgunder ) in particular – is on the rise in Germany. In fact, Deutschland is now the world’s third-largest producer of Pinot Noir, behind France (where it originated, of course) and the USA. Even our friends at Selbach mentioned in their newsletter that they’ve begun experimenting with Pinot Noir, though they haven’t bottled any yet. Our Willow Tree bar carries three Rotweine imported from Germany: Valckenberg Dornfelder (semi-sweet) Starling Castle Red (semi-sweet) Valckenberg Undone Pinot Noir – which you can also find at our Magnolia Square Market True German Deli, along with these additional varieties: Affentaler Pinot Noir AOC Schaffhausen Hallauer Spätlese Pinot Noir (Switzerland) Wild Senses Red Wine Grafen Repperg Lemberger Gartenzwerg P.S. – For anyone interested, here’s a couple links with a little more background, written by people who know a lot more about wine than Garden Gnomes do: Financial Times Vinepair Author Hollerbachs Posted on January 12, 2018 January 12, 2018 Categories German Traditions Posts pagination Page 1 Page 2 … Page 125 Next page Willow Tree Cafe Magnolia Square Market Outfitters Order Online Catering Join the Team Oktoberfest 2017 Hollerbach's Blog at WordPress.com.

That dream became a reality in 2001, when her parents bought Willow Tree Cafe. The restaurant was tiny then but has since ballooned with the success of the business. “They actually bought the restaurant with 60 seats and six employees for $60,000,” Hollerbach said. “And of course, since then, we now have about 160 employees and see almost 10,000 guests a week between all of our businesses.” [ ADD YOUR BUSINESS TO THE FLORIDA FOODIE DIRECTORY ] Hollerbach’s German Restaurant has since taken over a large portion of the building it sits in. The family has also expanded to have a market, selling baked goods and imported meats, and an outfitter full of authentic German costumes and outfits. In the more than 20 years since the restaurant first opened, Hollerbach has taken the reins of the business as its CEO. Hollerbach said the businesses are selling more than just food. They are selling a feeling of warmth and friendliness expressed best by the German word gemütlichkeit. Find every episode of Florida Foodie on YouTube: “That’s what we’re trying to achieve all the time for these guests,” she said. “It’s why people like to celebrate special occasions here because you get that energy and like yes, the food is a huge part of it because it adds to that experience, but it is just one part of it.” Part of that effort to provide a cozy experience is by offering something for everyone, including its main restaurant which mimics a German beer hall with live music, a lodge for more of a bar atmosphere and the upstairs restaurant, Uber Keller, which offers a more laid back experience and serves German tapas. Hollerback feels as though the restaurant has helped to drive some change in Sanford — helping to take it from a sleepy suburb to a destination. “I would definitely consider us as a catalyst of making people believe that Sanford had a nightlife and a future because, you know, (the restaurant) was lunch only and we used to open for dinner on just Fridays and Saturdays and we would have like 10 covers. Now, there’s a line out the door,” she said. Hollerbach is very active in the community as well. She is an advocate for the city and works closely with the Sanford Main Street organization to push for improvements in the city. “I can still pause and appreciate and be grateful for what is happening right now while still simultaneously going ‘Alright, well, we got to fix this,” she said. On the latest episode of Florida Foodie, Hollerbach shares more of her family’s history and how it is woven into the fabric of the restaurant. She also shares some of the food that can be found there with Lisa Bell and Candace Campos . Check out the Florida Foodie podcast.

The music venue is at 200 Myrtle Avenue, about a five-minute walk from Hollerbach’s. “We are incredibly excited about this new chapter,” Hollerbach’s CEO Christina Hollerbach said in a prepared statement. “Tuffy’s has always been a fantastic venue for live music and entertainment, and we are eager to complement that with our culinary offerings.” [EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT!

Caregivers bear the weight of the disease, but a local organization called Dementia-Friendly Dining is hoping to lessen the load for caregivers and provide them with the opportunity to make memories with their loved ones while out to dinner. Dennis Dulniak, co-founder of Dementia-Friendly Dining, said the organization came to be because of his own experience with the illness. “I suffered through this with my wife, and it was with my wife where we created our first restaurant,” Dulniak said. “I was very, very proud that I could still take my wife out and enjoy that experience and I treasure those moments because I no longer have them.” [EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos ] So far, five Central Florida restaurants have signed up to provide Dementia-Friendly Dining, including the organization’s newest addition, Hollerbach’s in Sanford. Dulniak said when a restaurant decides to participate, their staff undergoes special training to be able to provide the dementia-friendly dining experience. “We will have Hollerbach’s staff take them to their back area, their side room, to where there’s not so much attractions, noise, the music is off in that area, and we place the client — the person with dementia — with their back to the door so that their visuals are more focused on their loved one,” Dulniak said. “We train the servers to establish great eye contact, a contagious smile, and focusing on the fact that we’re delivering quality service.” Chris Cremen, chief operating officer for Hollerbach’s German Restaurant, said the reaction was bigger than expected when they announced the restaurant would offer dementia-friendly dining. “Everyone kind of has a connection to dementia one way or another and that turns out very true,” Cremen said. “Tons of our staff have been connected to people, and then our guests have already started asking questions about it, making connections with our staff through it so the ripple is already there.” Dementia-Friendly Dining’s other co-founder Toni Gitles said that being able to go out to dinner not only helps the patient, but the caregiver too. “Going out to eat is a tradition in the United States,” Gitles said. “It’s something that’s normal and it makes you feel normal when you’re able to do that and when you’re in a safe environment.” Hollerbach’s will begin offering dementia-friendly dining starting Monday, July 15, and every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. Check out the Florida Foodie podcast.
