They also ask me about my family, and why we chose to become funeral directors. \r\nI often think that we didn’t choose our vocation, as much as it chose us! \r\nCertainly, the story of Toronto’s Jewish community, the story of my family\r\nand the story of the chapel have evolved together, each aspect shaping the others.\r\nMy kids asked me to write this section of the website to provide some “historical\r\nperspective” – ah, it’s great getting old.

It was created in 1986 by a group of park enthusiasts and local philanthropists concerned with Memorial Park’s persistent state of decline and disrepair, just a year after Memorial Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Riverside (now Riverside-Avondale) National Historic District. In 1987 the Association entered an Adopt-a-Park Agreement with the City of Jacksonville, which has since enabled it to perform various operations and maintenance functions, including necessary physical improvements, consistent with the historical character of the park and concurrent with the City’s obligation to maintain Memorial Park for the greater public good. In 1988, the Association commissioned initial restoration plans for the park. By 1992, a project to restore the iconic memorial sculpture Spiritualized Life was initiated for the first time since its installation in 1924. Another followed in 2004. Between 1993 and 2012, the Association facilitated numerous projects and initiatives to further preserve and protect the park, including the installation of ornamental metal fencing around the perimeter and upgrades to the irrigation and lighting systems, the planting of oaks and other native vegetation, the renovation of the entrance piers, plaza, balustrades, and fountain basin, and the dedication of marble benches to honor various important friends of Memorial Park, just to name a few. Photo Courtesy of Mark Krancer Photo Courtesy of Mark Krancer Current Efforts & Goals In 2012, Memorial Park Association initiated major planning efforts to restore and rehabilitate Memorial Park to its original grandeur. With the help of Atlanta-based landscape architect David Sacks (RLA), “who took painstaking efforts to fully research the history and significance of the origins of the park, from sketches and plans of hardscape and plantings to detailed correspondence between Ninah Cummer and the Olmsted Brothers,” the Association has a viable master plan which was used as the foundation for Spirit of Victory, an ambitious capital campaign, and for the restoration project that will span the next several years.

Camp Wheeler was established in 1917 as one of 16 Army National Guard Mobilization and Training Camps. It cost $4 million to build and was named for Joseph Wheeler, who served as a brigadier general for the U.S. Army and as a lieutenant general for the Confederacy. It was home to the 31st Infantry Division in World War I, known as the “Dixie” Division, as most who trained here were from Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The 31st Division spent most of the war in camp and was sent as a replacement division in France in October 1918, which meant individual members were dispersed to existing units. As a whole division, the 31st never saw combat. By the time the camp closed in 1919, 80,000 troops had trained there. Most of Florida’s Fallen who died at Camp Wheeler were members of the 124 th Infantry. The 1st and 2d Regiments of Florida National Guard Infantry were drafted into Federal service on August 5, 1917, at Jacksonville and Wauchula, respectively. Consolidated, reorganized, and redesignated as the 124th Infantry on October 1, the unit was assigned to the 31st Division, with headquarters at Camp Wheeler. Florida troops, Camp Wheeler, February 1918 Most of the deaths among 124 th Infantry troops occurred during the Fall 1917-Winter 1918 months. The number one cause of death was pneumonia, followed by meningitis, empyema, measles, and tuberculosis. There was one case each of mumps, appendicitis, heart failure, intestinal obstruction, pleurisy, septicemia, and septic thrombosis. Another one was shot to death while attempting to escape by a camp guard.  Of the 108 of Florida’s Fallen, 100 died of respiratory illness or an influenza-like communicable disease. The fact that so many deaths occurred in so brief a time alarmed everyone. The fear that their sons were being neglected or ill-treated prompted a call to action. Gov. Sidney Catts, whose own son was stationed at Wheeler and heard firsthand about conditions at the camp, called on President Wilson, the Chief of Staff, and Secretary of War to investigate, threatening to recall all Florida troops unless the government did something. In response, a team of medical investigators, led by Major General William C. Gorgas, surgeon general of the army, inspected Camp Wheeler on November 23, 1917. Gorgas reported that the camp was, overall, in good condition and the troops were being “well cared for.” Similar inspections by delegations from Alabama and Georgia came to the same conclusion. But there were legitimate causes for concern. For one thing, the camp of roughly 25,000 at the time was overcrowded and many men did not have adequate winter uniforms. Gorgas recommended that physical distancing be implemented, allowing for at least 50-square-feet of space per man. This meant reducing the number in tents from 9 to 5. In addition, Gorgas stipulated that no new recruits be allowed to enter the camp until the situation had improved. Gorgas was also concerned about an epidemic at the camp. At the time of his visit, there were more than 3,000 cases of measles in the hospital, and 300 cases of pneumonia which had developed from the measles, though the death rate was comparatively low. Moreover, the men were in overcrowded wards without adequate nursing staff. Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, who also visited the camp in February 1918, insisted that a new hospital wing under construction would help to alleviate this problem. Meanwhile, to help relieve overcrowding, Camp Wheeler officials transferred more than 125 convalescents to hospital at Fort McPherson near Atlanta. In addition, numerous tuberculosis patients were discharged from the Army and sent home, and more nurses were assigned to the base hospital at Wheeler. Finally, wooden barracks replaced tents. Such measures helped, and the number of cases declined. It was not until late Spring 1918, when 13,460 men, or about 80 per cent of the entire camp strength, were vaccinated against pneumonia, that the threat of pneumonia at Camp Wheeler finally subsided. Among Florida’s Fallen at Camp Wheeler John Eldred Jenkins Born November 15, 1888, in Madison County, Florida, Jenkins was the oldest of three sons of Jessie Jenkins (1865-1937) and Frances (Fannie) Buston (1868-1937). A farmer in Dowling Park, Florida, he was inducted in the army at Live Oak, Florida on September 18, 1917. He was married and had a 1 ½ year-old-son at the time of his death, which occurred on February 3, 1918, owing to pneumonia. He was buried in Beulah Baptist Cemetery, Dowling Park, Suwanee County, Florida. Also dying on the same date as Jenkins at Camp Wheeler was Elzie Burke, of Westville Florida, who had enlisted in the Florida National Guard at Chipley on April 12, 1917. George (Georgie) L. Dillon One of seven children of Charles Marion Dillon (1854-1899) and Ida Adams (1856-1908) of Key West, Dillon was born on December 30, 1890. He worked as a fisherman in Hillsborough County (1910). In the 1914 city directory for Key West, he resided at 515 Margaret Street, along with his brother Earl, an Army sergeant, Romeo, also a fisherman, and Cleveland, a policeman.

The iconic balustrade, which lines the river’s edge, was destroyed during the Category 2 hurricane Sept. 11, 2017. After being flooded, the park’s centerpiece sculpture, Life , was evaluated in March 2018 by the professional team at McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory Inc., which noted salt deposits in the pores of the bronze. The sculpture was reconditioned with great satisfaction in June 2018, but the park’s historic, decorative, concrete balustrade has yet to be replaced. According to Daryl Joseph, City of Jacksonville Parks Director, in order to be reimbursed through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund, the plans to replace the balustrade must be reviewed by local, state and federal engineers, as well as environmental and historical experts prior to proceeding with the construction. “We are anticipating completion in Summer 2020,” said Joseph at an Oct. 24 town hall event hosted by District 14 Councilwoman Randy DeFoor. The Parks Department said in an email that after the plans are approved a 30-day bid process will commence, followed by approximately three months for execution of the contract. “Construction should take less than six months after they start,” the email noted. Supporters of Jacksonville’s World War I memorial, which represents the entire State of Florida, have expressed additional concerns about the park’s appearance, citing overflowing trash bins, landscaping needs and the plywood still left covering the excavation area in front of the fountain where the parchment scrolls listing the names of those known Florida Fallen in 1924 were unearthed in September 2018. Michele Luthin, Memorial Park Association board member, indicated that the nonprofit relies on volunteers to keep an eye on the park’s needs, including daily replenishing of pet waste bags. Additionally, park visitors may email info@memparkjax.org to inform the association of issues that need to be addressed. Memorial Park Association plans to re-bury the World War I scrolls – a list of more than 1,600 names of men and women who died during or after service in the Great War – as soon as the archival process is complete. – End – About Memorial Park The six-acre Olmsted Brothers designed park is located in historic Riverside at 1620 Riverside Avenue and was established in 1924 to honor all those Floridians who died in service during World War I. The U.S. Department of the Interior acknowledged the park as significant by listing Memorial Park in the National Park Service’s National Register of Historic Places in 2017, shortly after the United States World War I Centennial Commission designated the park’s bronze sculpture, Spiritualized Life, as a World War I Centennial Memorial. About Memorial Park Association Established in 1986, the Memorial Park Association is a nonprofit with the mission to enhance, promote and preserve Memorial Park as the premier historic park in the City of Jacksonville. In 2012, Memorial Park Association enlisted Atlanta-based landscape architect David Sacks, to create a Master Plan to rehabilitate Memorial Park to its original grandeur. In 2018, MPA achieved its capital campaign goal of $1.5 million to implement this Master Plan. About The 1924 Florida Fallen Scrolls Project During the Dec. 25, 1924 dedication of Memorial Park, scrolls listing 1,220 names of men and women who died in service during World War I – the Florida Fallen – were placed in a lead box, which was soldered shut and placed in a copper box, also soldered shut, then interred to honor and remember those fallen. In September 2018 the scrolls were unearthed, and their condition evaluated at St. Augustine-based L.A.M.P, by a paper conservator. The scrolls were then released to a leading authority, Dr. R.B. Rosenburg, Associate Dean and Professor of History, College of Arts & Sciences, Clayton State University, Morrow, Georgia, for the purpose of comparing those names listed on the scrolls to a list he had compiled at the request of MPA. His research resulted in a new tally of more than 1,600 Floridians to be counted among the Florida Fallen.

Memorial Park Map History: General William Jackson Palmer donated the land with Prospect Lake to establish the park. Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region’s largest balloon festival has been held on Labor Day weekend at Memorial Park since 1977. The city stopped operating the beach house in 2010 due to budget cuts following the great recession. In 2012, it reopened when the city partnered with the YMCA of the Pikes Peak Region to operate the beach area. The beach house closed again in 2019 due to construction. Work to redesign the iconic beach house began in 2018 and was completed in July 2021.

Confirm and close About Jack.org Jack.org is Canada's largest network of young people supporting young people, offering youth a space to safely learn about mental health, support their peers, seek professional support, and advocate for a future where youth can thrive in mental wellness. Donate Now Donate Now Play Our Vision: A world where youth are mentally healthy, not in distress. Our Mission : To work alongside youth to build communities and advocate for equitable systems that support their mental health needs. â By empowering youth to understand mental health, support their peers, and advocate for change, we build a future where youth can thrive. Building a Better Future for Youth The complex challenges young people are dealing with today are only growing. To end the crisis youth are facing, and build a future where youth can not only survive, but thrive, we need to build solutions that work for youth, with them. â Our History Since our founding in 2010, Jack.org has been pioneering innovative, youth-led solutions that empower young people to take charge of their mental health and wellbeing. What started as a small pilot event for youth has grown into a thriving nationwide network of youth change-makers from coast to coast to coast. Today, thousands of young people are part of our community, sharing insights, building support systems, and creating a country where mental health conversation is normalized, inclusive, and empowering. â Our Vision and Approach From the beginning, we've believed in the extraordinary power of young people to transform the mental health landscape. Young people often recognize when their peers are struggling before anyone else. They are trusted sources of support and information, and their voices carry the power to normalize difficult conversations around mental health. By equipping young people with resources, knowledge, and community to drive change, we're not only supporting individuals but strengthening entire communities through peer-to-peer connection and support. Our Journey and Impact In the last 15 years, weâve continuously evolved our programs and expanded our reach to meet the changing needs of young people. Through our work, weâre breaking down barriers and building safe spaces for mental health support and education. From community events to educational platforms, we offer diverse, responsive resources that empower young people to prioritize mental health â both for themselves and their peers. While we have made significant strides in expanding the mental health conversation to more communities than ever before, there is still an enormous amount of work for us to do. Demand for mental health programs is at an all-time high. We must continue to grow and reach new groups of young people if we are to reverse the troubling rise of mental distress among young people in Canada. â As we look to the future, we are dedicated to advancing our programs to ensure that every young person in Canada has access to the tools, community, and support they need to thrive. Together, we can build the future youth deserve. â Our Commitment to Transparency and Trust Jack.org is accredited by Imagine Canada, Canadaâs most esteemed nonprofit standards, for excellence in accountability, transparency, and good governance. We are dedicated to holding ourselves to the highest standards for our community, supporters, and the youth we serve.

About Highland Memorial Park Highland Memorial Park is a 70-acre cemetery located in the city of New Berlin. In 2023 we celebrated our 95th anniversary. The cemetery has been owned by the Porter family for the past 75 years. Our goal at Highland Memorial Park is to serve our customers with a friendly attitude and to give them the best service possible. It’s important to us to make the experience of burying a loved one as easy as possible. We are committed to providing services and maintaining our grounds to the highest standard, ensuring the most beautiful park possible for loved ones to bury their family members. History Highland Memorial Park was started in 1928 by a group of people from West Allis. In 1947, E. Glen Porter, Sr. joined the company and in 1951 Mr. Porter, Sr. and his wife Charlotte Porter purchased the cemetery. Dr. E. Glen Porter and his wife Kay F. Porter joined the company in 1964. E. Glen Porter III joined in 1984 and his wife Phyllis A. Porter joined in 1997. The Porter family continues to own and manage Highland Memorial Park. Highland Memorial Park has grown to become one of the busiest cemeteries in Wisconsin. We perform about 600 burials per year at the present time. In 2023, Highland Memorial Park marked 95 years serving the families of southeastern Wisconsin. Highland Memorial Park was begun as a family business, which continues to this day. We are one of the few family owned and operated cemeteries in Wisconsin. Because of this unique status, we are able to give greater personal attention to our families, as well as to the dedicated people that work here. It is our goal to make Highland Memorial Park a beautiful and pleasant place to visit. We welcome your suggestions on how we can improve toward that goal. How can we help?

Memorial Park plays a vital role in our community and a partnership with our “Adopt the Park” sponsors ensures that it will continue to be a source of legacy for generations to come. Memorial Park Association, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) Florida nonprofit entity dedicated to the protection and preservation of Memorial Park in Jacksonville, Florida. It was created in 1986 by a group of park enthusiasts and local philanthropists concerned with Memorial Park’s persistent state of decline and disrepair, just a year after Memorial Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Riverside (now Riverside-Avondale) National Historic District. The Association is in a time of great growth as we raise awareness in the community about who we are and the intrinsic value Memorial Park has for the community and especially our North Bank businesses. We are enthused over our latest prospects and hopeful you will share an interest to support the work we do in the park.

In November 1918 George Hardee of the Jacksonville Rotary Club proposed a memorial to honor Floridians who died in service during WWI. Paid for by the citizens of greater Jacksonville, the new commemorative public park opened on Christmas Day 1924.\n\nIn October 2017 the United States World War One Centennial Commission designated Memorial Park’s sculpture “Spiritualized Life” by renowned sculptor C. Adrian Pillars as a WWI Centennial Memorial. In November 2017 the U.S. Department of the Interior added Memorial Park to the National Park Service’s National Register of Historic Places. 2 Ninah Cummer Monument The Citizens Committee, along with various civic leaders and philanthropists, such as Morgan Gress, Edith Gray, Mary Cline, and Ninah May Holden Cummer, planned the park’s development. Mrs. Cummer (1875-1958), a passionate gardener, was active in several charitable groups. As a leading light of Riverside society and inspired by the gardens of Europe, she gathered a group of 20 friends in her Riverside mansion on the St. Johns River on March 25, 1922, to organize a garden club to create a more beautiful city. The result was the Garden Club of Jacksonville, Inc., founded in April 1924. Subsequently, Mrs. Cummer willed her home, with its stunning gardens and cultural treasures, to be turned into a museum. The Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens, built on the site of the home of Arthur and Ninah Cummer, opened its doors November 10, 1961. 3 The Garden House Memorial Park Association (MPA) organizes various opportunities for the community to become involved in park maintenance, which is staged from the Garden House. Follow us on Facebook @memparkjax to learn about opportunities to get involved or click here . 4 St. Johns River The St. Johns River is one of three in the world that runs north. The longest river in Florida, it is significant for commercial and recreational use. For 310 miles it winds through or borders 12 counties and is nearly three miles across in places. Seawater and freshwater mix at the lower St. Johns River estuary, creating brackish (part salt, part fresh) water that is home to a variety of fish, including sharks, porpoises, redfish, and rays in the north, while largemouth bass, sheepshead, crappie, bluegills, shellcrackers, and catfish are found in the freshwater farther south. 5 Adopt The Park Sponsors The Memorial Park Association’s Adopt The Park sponsorship program was launched in May 2015. The program funds the Landscape & Grounds Committee’s annual expenses to enhance and beautify Memorial Park. View Sponsors 6 Spiritualized Life, Charles Adrian Pillars Born and trained in the Midwest, Charles Adrian Pillars (1870–1937) was an accomplished and highly successful sculptor who settled in northeast Florida in 1894. Pillars was a student of the Beaux Arts tradition of dramatic, romantic, classically-inspired, and often allegorical sculpture that dominated much civic art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He studied under renowned Chicago sculptor Lorado Taft, creator of the monumental Columbus Fountain at Washington’s Union Station and a number of famous works in Chicago and elsewhere. In his Spiritualized Life composition Pillars made powerful use of the Beaux Arts style to tell a moving story of the true spirit of those who served in WWI. He wrote that he “desired this memorial to present the idea of life, its struggle and its victory.”\n\nWhile striving to make a composition visualizing this, I found a poem by Alan Seeger, a soldier- victim of the war. At once I saw the typical spirit of the boys who went overseas – saw with their eyes a world in the insane grip of greed and ambition, caught in the ceaseless swirl of selfishness, hate and covetousness, ever struggling against submergence. I saw these boys giving up their homes, sweethearts, wives and mothers to go overseas and through the supreme sacrifice make secure the happiness and safety of their loved ones. With this vivid picture in mind, I constructed a sphere to represent the world, engirdled with masses of swirling water typifying the chaotic earth forces. In this surging mass of waters, I shaped human figures, all striving to rise above this flood, struggling for mere existence. Last, surmounting these swirling waters, with their human freight, I placed the winged figure of Youth, representative of spiritual life, the spirit of these boys which was the spirit of victory. Immortality attained not through death, but deeds; not a victory of brute force, but of spirit. This figure of Youth Sacrificed wears his crown of laurels won. He holds aloft an olive branch, the emblem of peace.\n\nWhile Spiritualized Life is probably C.A. Pillars’ best-known surviving work, he went on to complete a number of commissions before his death, including a bronze figure of William Boyd Barnett, founder of Barnett Bank, completed for the bank’s 50th anniversary in 1931; coincidentally, the Barnett family sponsored the restoration of Memorial Park’s twin entry gates on Riverside Avenue in 1994, in memory of William Boyd Barnett’s great-grandson William Randle Barnett. 7 Plaque Honoring Florida Fallen Memorial Park commemorates all Floridians who died in the Great War (World War I) and whose names were originally inscribed on parchment scrolls, sealed in a lead box within a bronze box and buried beneath the plaza in front of the fountain. Damaged by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, the original scrolls are preserved and available for viewing at the Jacksonville Public Library downtown. Copies of the scrolls, including the more than 500 additional names discovered since 2018, will be buried beneath the plaque in 2024. For a list of The Florida Fallen, click here . 8 Eagle Sculptures Diane LaFond Insetta, an internationally known Jacksonville artist, created the two bronze eagle sculptures flanking the entrance to the fountain and the Life sculpture. To replace the original coquina eagle sculptures that were installed in the 1920s, the bronze eagles were given to the City of Jacksonville by Memorial Park Association on May 29, 2011. To see how the artist created the eagles, click here to watch a video. 9 Rotary Marker The Rotary Club of Jacksonville was instrumental in creating Memorial Park. To commemorate the Jacksonville club’s 100th anniversary in 2018, the Rotary Club created this marker to help us all remember the sacrifices and heroism of World War I soldiers. The design focuses on the Doughboy coming home from the war, proud of what he has done and of what our country did in The Great War. The monument curves, like a soldier’s chest swelled with pride. 10 Olmsted Bros. The nationally known firm of Olmsted Brothers Landscape Architects (Brookline, MA) designed the park to serve as a welcoming urban oasis as well as an appropriate setting for the memorial sculpture.\n\nThe firm was run by stepbrothers John Charles Olmsted (1852-1920) and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. (1870-1957), sons of the eminent landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York’s Central Park, Asheville’s Biltmore Estate gardens, and Boston’s “emerald necklace.” Along with providing an appropriate, emotionally powerful setting that would show the Spiritualized Life sculpture to its best advantage, the firm sought to create an inviting and beautiful space for the use and enjoyment of all of Jacksonville’s citizens. The park was designed to be as simple as possible and to provide a place for the public to come and seek as much rest and peace of body and mind as is possible in a small area close to streets and traffic. 11 Flora & Fauna Memorial Park is home to over 40 Live Oak trees. There are also Cabbage Palms (native to the area), exotic Date Palms and Coontie Palms (also native). Spring blooms include Japanese Tulip Trees; Plum Trees; Red Buds; Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow; Sweet Olive; Agapanthus; Amaryllis, and the most prevalent: Azaleas. Fall blooms include Plumbago and Crepe Myrtle. Winter blooms include Camellias. Year-round greens include Podocarpus and Viburnum. Memorial Park’s most common animals are the ground squirrels. The park is also home to many North Florida birds and waterfowl. 12 Memorial Park Association Memorial Park Association, Inc. (MPA), a nonprofit corporation solely for the purpose of the restoration and preservation of the park, was created in 1986 by a group of park enthusiasts and local philanthropists concerned with its persistent state of decline and disrepair. In 1987 MPA entered into an Adopt-a-Park Agreement with the City of Jacksonville that has since enabled it to perform various operations and maintenance functions, including necessary physical improvements, consistent with the historical character of the park and concurrent with the City’s obligation to maintain Memorial Park for the greater public good.\n\nWith no paid staff and an all-volunteer board of dedicated directors, the Association encourages community participation in its volunteer and donor base, promotes the park to citizens and visitors across the region, and works to perpetuate the beauty and character of Memorial Park for generations to come.

Testimonials From The Families We Serve \"Park Memorial Funeral Home provides the best service that I can ask for on such a terrible day of losing my grandma and under the strict social restriction due to Covid19. I would like to give my gratitude to Gilla and Jacky Leung for their understanding, professional and helpfulness to my family in this tough time. Gilla and Jacky were easy to connect and always respond to our questions in a timely manner. Gilla and Jacky went out of their way to help my family arranging my grandma's funeral service which made things a lot easier for us during this tough time. Thank you Park Memorial Funeral Home and all the staff for helping us.\" Ann Pham \"Back in May 2020 we lost my wife/a mother/sister and a friend to many. We had no idea where to go with respect to funeral arrangements but are so happy we picked Park Memorial. Alexandra from Park Memorial was a kind, considerate and caring person that made the process so much easier. She answered our questions in an extremely timely manner and made us feel like we were the only clients she had. 17 months after the funeral we reached out to Alexandra to help us get some programs printed for the Celebration of Life. She helped us immediately with no questions. I hope we are not in the market to use a funeral home in the near future but if we are… There really is no choice. Thank you Park Memorial!\" Terry Lashyn \"Park Memorial was amazing. These people have one of the hardest jobs on the planet. Constantly surrounded by sad people, yet they maintain a loving, caring and respectful demeanour. My first contact was late evening jan 22 2021. My brother was found deceased in his apartment. They had someone there to collect him in an hour and a half. The 2 gentlemen that picked him up were so kind and thoughtful. I was a complete mess and they reassured me they would take good care of him. Next contact was with Brad. Once again very kind and helpful. We then came in and met with Nicole. She was thoughtful and walked us through my brothers arrangements so throughly still keeping a kind disposition. Then today I received a call my brothers urn was to be picked up. Tracy sat down with me and was so compassionate to our story and even became emotional too, which just showed me how much these people have to endure dealing with grieving people and attempt to not bring that home with them. The level of care and compassion I received from everyone is very much appreciated and made a horribly traumatizing event seamless and as painless as possible. Bless you all and all your hard work. Thank you again.\" Jodi Byrne-Marsh \"I cannot say enough about the care and service your Park Memorial Family provides to your clients. I had a very sudden unexpected death of my sister in an Edmonton Hospital a few weeks ago. She was not from Alberta, and her son didn’t make it in time to see her. He was obviously devastated, and wanted to see his mother. It was a Saturday evening, and since I knew of your Funeral home, I called it. I was pleasantly surprised that a real person answered (not answering machine) took our information, said he would arrange to have her picked up, and someone would call first thing in the morning to make arrangements for us to see her. This arrangement was made and we got to spend a couple of hours with her. We were never rushed, Robbi was very kind and caring, and when we were ready, we sat down with her to go through all the logistics, and start arrangement. We soon realized we needed a SIN# which was at her home 1100 km away, and her son had to go back to get it, which paused arrangements. We decided to have a Chapel service for her family here before cremation. Again, Robbi got it organized ,even finding us a Priest to do the service, as we knew nobody here. The two gentlemen attending us at the service (sorry, I do not remember their names) were so compassionate, caring and kind. We encountered several of your staff while making arrangements, and your staff is truly a Family who work together to provide clients with outstanding service during a very difficult, trying time. Your staff made an unbearable situation bearable. Your kindness will not be forgotten. Please pass my sincere Thank You to Robbi and others who attended us.\" Sonia Mudry OUR HERITAGE The Building of a Dream and a Family Tod Smolyk started out in 1941 as a funeral director with a dream. He had his own embalming instruments and 12 friends who had each contributed $100 to help him start his company. One of the doors he knocked on introduced Tod to Lucy Kostynuk, who ended up becoming the funeral home’s largest investor. To be able to contribute his share, Tod had to donate his embalming instruments to the company at their appraised value. The courtship of Tod and Lucy turned into an engagement, and the rest was history. Tod and his fiancée, Lucy, were married at 3 p.m. on November 29, 1941. Instead of heading out to enjoy a honeymoon, they opened the doors to their new funeral home at 6 p.m. that same evening. Park Memorial's first hearse was a 1941 Ford panel truck that was converted locally, and the first car used to chauffeur families was a used Studebaker sedan.

Tod Smolyk & Lucy (Kostynuk) Smolyk Park Memorial Founders 1917 - 1976 | 1919- 2002 \"I selected the name Park Memorial at a time when all other funeral homes in Edmonton carried the names of their owners. I wanted to ensure there were no overtones suggesting a preference to serve one religious denomination or a specific ethnic group over another.\" – Tod Smolyk Tod and Lucy wedding photo.

Photo from 1967 Button A Growing Network of Care As business improved, the company expanded to communities outside of Edmonton. The Vegreville branch was purchased in 1943, the Lamont branch in 1946, the Vilna branch in 1951, the Wildwood and Mayerthorpe branches in 1955, and the Smoky Lake branch in 1956. The present Edmonton building is not the original. The former building was sold and moved off the property and the current building was built in 1963 on the original site of Park Memorial at the corner of 97 Street and 111 Avenue. The current building was actually built right around the original as it was located on the space that is our front (north) parking lot today. The size of the original 1941 building was much smaller and would have fit entirely in the space occupied by our present chapel. A Second Generation of Leadership Jerry Smolyk (In Memorium) & Midge Smolyk Former President and Second Generation Family Owners \"I love being a funeral director and I am proud to be in funeral service. I see our association ﻿ as a fellowship between members. Companionship, not a competition.\" – Jerry Smolyk Sadly, Tod passed away suddenly in 1976, but his son Jerry was ready and willing to carry on the family business. Jerry and his wife Midge purchased the company shares from his mother Lucy, and they owned and operated the company very successfully for 41 years, until Jerry’s passing on October 18, 2017, leaving a legacy of achievements for Park Memorial. Jerry grew up in the funeral profession as Park Memorial was started by his parents, Tod and Lucy Smolyk in 1941, when they got married and opened the funeral home on the same day. Serving families and ensuring that they had the best funeral experience possible was what he always strived for. It’s what he learned from his own father. He never saw things in just black and white, as he knew there were always shades of gray. Jerry always went above and beyond to help a family who was in need or was dealing with special extenuating circumstances. And regardless of the situation, he always strived to be fair, honest and ethical. He had high expectations and wanted his family and staff to always help out where they could, as he knew that positivity and kindness always comes back to us in some way, somehow. Jerry was always an advocate and champion for the funeral profession. He attended almost every single provincial, national and international convention throughout his many decades in the profession. With an incredible amount of enthusiasm and energy for the profession, he was one of the first to stand up and share his opinion, yet he was open minded and quick to let others know when they had a thought that made him reconsider his stance on things. Jerry thought that every opinion shared was worthy of thought and consideration. Some of his strongest friendships emerged from his relationships with colleagues, and their mutual support and respect for one another. One of Jerry’s first interviews in 1975 quoted him as saying, “I love being a funeral director and I am proud to be in funeral service. I see our association as a fellowship between members…companionship, not a competition.” This belief in his profession led Jerry to hold various positions and give of his time and energy to virtually every level within the profession. He served as chairman of the provincial school committee; served on committees for public relations, government relations and disaster services; he was a board member of the national association for 12 years, eventually becoming the president of the Funeral Service Association of Canada in 1978-79; he was a board member and president of the Alberta Funeral Services Association from 1979-80; and he was one of the founding members of the Canadian Independent Group of Funeral Homes in 1990. Jerry was also recognized by his peers for many of his professional accomplishments. He was presented the FSAC Award of Merit in 2010, which is awarded to those individuals who go above and beyond and who truly look for the greater good in funeral service… where time and time again they will put the profession in front of their own personal goals. In 2011, Jerry was presented with an Honourary Life Membership from the Alberta Funeral Service Association (AFSA). He is one of only six people to have ever been presented this award. He worked hard to earn the respect of his colleagues and it was important to him to know he earned it. Following his death in 2017, Jerry was posthumously awarded the Robert Snodgrass award in recognition of outstanding excellence in community service, contributions to AFSA, and enhancement of the funeral profession.

Photo from 2017 Button A Third Generation Now Leads Us Kirstie Smolyk Current President & Park Memorial Third Generation Owner ﻿ \"I desired to see the business thrive, and to see our family heritage of caring for bereaved families continue.\" Currently in its third generation into the company's management, Kirstie Smolyk, Tod's granddaughter and Jerry's daughter, continues the funeral tradition of the Smolyk family as president of Park Memorial. She has been leading the organization for well over a decade. Park Memorial truly walks forward as a family business, as Kirstie’s mother Midge, sister Lindy, and husband Nelson are all involved in day-to-day operations. Kirstie shares her journey into her role in the family business: “I grew up in the funeral profession, so it was an easy tie-in. I grew up colouring under my dad’s desk, playing in the staff room, and it was what I knew. I worked at the funeral home all through university but wasn’t sure what I really wanted to do with my career. I thought I wanted to be in marketing, and my dad, who was president at the time, agreed and saw the value of my pursuit of different opportunities, learning from other industries and professionals. A few years later, I came to a crossroads in my career, and we went for a ‘Daddy / Daughter’ lunch. He recognized the breadth of experience that I had acquired in my time away from funeral service and invited me back. It was the right time, and I accepted. I desired to see the business thrive, and to see our family heritage of caring for bereaved families continue. I also better understood the flexibility that comes with leading a family-owned business.” Steadfast in her desire to see the legacy of her grandfather and her father thrive under her leadership, Kirstie is a force of kindness, compassion, and community development.

It is one of Jacksonville’s best loved treasures. Located along the banks of the majestic St. Johns River (incidentally, at one of its widest points, as it starts to turn east from its southern source towards its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean), this six-acre park draws visitors from across the Northeast Florida community. On any given day, families and friends, athletes and yogis, sunbathers, fishermen, and readers enjoy a quiet respite with magnificent views from this landmark open space. The park is walking distance to local restaurants and pubs, the shops at 5 Points, and the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens, and just a short drive to downtown Jacksonville. Location & Directions Park Hours Memorial Park is a public park belonging to the City of Jacksonville. As such, park hours are determined to be from sunrise to sunset, unless a permitted event is scheduled. Search for: Interested in hosting your wedding or special event at Memorial Park? Apply for a permit Nearby Attractions Situated along the banks of the St. Johns River, Memorial Park is within easy walking distance to a variety of retail, restaurants and historic residences. For those who live nearby, the park has provided a respite and a place of recreation for nearly 100 years. Photo courtesty of the Cummer Museum Cummer museum of art & Gardens Distance: 0.3 miles Along with Memorial Park, the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens is surely one of Jacksonville’s crown jewels, and it’s no coincidence that Ninah May Holden Cummer was a driving force in creating both. She developed a deep knowledge of Florida horticulture and advocated for greenspaces for the benefit of “all of the people.” The museum, its gardens and Memorial Park are outstanding examples of Ninah Cummer’s imprint on our city. Visit Website Photo courtesty of Mark Krancer Riverside Arts Market Distance: 0.4 miles Created in 2009, Riverside Arts Market draws visitors from all over Northeast Florida, who come each Saturday, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., to enjoy the harvest of local farmers, support the small businesses of artists, makers, bakers and food trucks, while enjoying family-friendly live music, dance and other performances. Visit Website Photo courtesty of Mark Krancer 5 Points Distance: 0.1 miles This eclectic, somewhat “Bohemian,” neighborhood within the Riverside area begins just outside the entrances to Memorial Park and encompasses roughly 70 blocks of retail, restaurants, residences, and recreation. Boasting vintage shops in business for four or more decades, restaurants with a wide variety of cuisines, and a quaint, nearly 100-year-old cinema, 5 Points was named after the five-street intersection which has stymied drivers for decades.
