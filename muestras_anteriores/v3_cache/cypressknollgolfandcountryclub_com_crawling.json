Built in 1989, Cypress Knoll Golf & Country Club is now family owned and operated by husband and wife Doug Brown and Janice Reid. Along with our staff and volunteer crew, we are dedicated to three things: keeping the Cypress Knoll course open to the public for the benefit of all Cypress Knoll residents, creating a friendly and fun atmosphere for all our guests, and providing a golf and dining experience our members are proud to share with family and friends. Tees times are available everyday starting at 7:30 am. The nines are now as Gary Player originally designed, with the 2007-built club house located at the turn and available for drinks and snacks or a quick meal. Our driving range is the largest in the area, and is open until sunset year-round. A “Pitch & Putt” style Par 3 course is also open for play on all 18 holes, every day after 2 pm. Cypress Knoll provides golfers fantastic views, secluded fairways, vibrant marshlands, beautiful lakes, and magnificent wildlife around every turn. Mr. Player designed Cypress to be challenging but fair, requiring perfect club selection to place the ball away from bunkers, water hazards and wetlands. The course draws you in to the way golf was intended to be, providing a golfing experience unique to our area. Whether you play a 9 or 18 hole round, Pitch & Putt, or just enjoy lunch on our deck with the best view in town, we invite you to experience the difference at Cypress Knoll.
