      "text": "Fort Myers waterfront restaurants: Oxbow Bar & Grill debuts downtown News Cape Coral Sports Opinion Restaurants Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals FOOD Fort Myers waterfront restaurants: Oxbow Bar & Grill debuts downtown Oxbow Bar & Grill, the latest restaurant from the company behind the Luminary Hotel, has made its waterfront debut in downtown Fort Myers. Here's a look. Annabelle Tometich Fort Myers News-Press At 11 a.m. Monday, March 22, Oxbow Bar & Grill made history, becoming the only riverfront restaurant in the commercial district of downtown Fort Myers. \"It is opening day. It's actually opening minute. As of — right now, we are open,\" Bob Megazzini said shortly after answering his phone last week. The general manager of the Luminary Hotel has seen quite a few opening days in recent months. The 12-story, 243-room property launched in late September, bringing a slew of new food concepts with it. Ella Mae's Diner occupies a far corner of the Luminary's main level, serving classic, thoroughly casual diner fare. There's an onsite coffee shop, Dean Street Coffee Roastery, and, high on the rooftop, Beacon Social Drinkery offers cocktails, small plates and sweeping views. There's a lobby bar, a kitchen theater called The Workshop, and the Luminary's flagship restaurant, Silver King Ocean Brasserie, where stone crab claws and Iberico ham collide with fresh pasta and dry-aged USDA Prime steaks. And, to cap it all off, there is now Oxbow. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. The new restaurant isn't in the Luminary Hotel. It's over a bridge and across the street. Oxbow occupies the space that formerly housed Art of the Olympians, a space owned by the City of Fort Myers. Oxbow and its parent company, the Tampa-based Mainsail Lodging & Development, won rights to the building in 2017 after edging out the 116-year-old Columbia Restaurant, which is also based in Tampa. Oxbow's 5,000 square feet and 120 seats overlook the Caloosahatchee.

In the hierarchy of Luminary restaurants, Oxbow sits between Ella Mae's and Silver King. Megazzini called it a \"casual fine dining experience.\" Chef Doug Clausing oversees the food side of that experience. Clausing has been with Luminary since its beginning. He launched Beacon Social Drinkery and has now moved his attention to Oxbow, where the dinner menu features smoked chicken wings, deviled eggs with Benton's ham, gumbo with local fish, three styles of oysters and much more. Oxbow's entrees range from a pulled pork sandwich on a brioche bun ($13) to andouille-crusted snapper ($29) and a grilled rib eye cap steak served with potato wedges and chimichurri ($39). Oxbow also features a full bar, including signature craft cocktails. The restaurant opens early on Sundays for brunch. Shannon Bizga, Oxbow's general manager, oversees the restaurant's dining rooms. The property's 2,400-square-foot second floor is designed for private events, though Megazzini said the second-story patio will be open to restaurant guests when possible. The building also features an outfitter-style retail store selling clothing and souvenirs, designed by Boaters Republic, an apparel company based in St. Petersburg. Through the retail space is a U-shaped bar that serves as Oxbow's centerpiece, followed by its open kitchen. \"I think we really did hit the mark on every kind of dining in our complex,\" Megazzini said of the Luminary's five eateries. \"This last one has been a long time in the making, and to have it finally here is exciting.\" Oxbow Bar & Grill is open 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday to Wednesday, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Thursday, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Sunday at 1300 Hendry St., Fort Myers; call 239-314-3856 or visit oxbowfortmyers.com for reservations and more.

Oxbow Bar & Grill is one of the newer additions to the downtown Fort Myers dining scene, and it has something almost no other place in the River District has. Waterfront. And it’s not just a view. In fact, when dining on the outdoor patio, it feels as if you are hovering over the Ca­loosahatchee River, watching the boats float by. Operated by the Luminary Hotel & Co., Oxbow occupies the space once known as the City Pier Building at the Yacht Basin. Bright and airy, its doors opened in March 2021 with a nautical and nostalgic theme, paying homage to the city’s history. Cocktail names make cheeky nods to luminaries such as Thomas Edison. Lit Like Edison has mezcal, pineapple, lime, agave, fee foam and chili spice. Then there is Mccan’t Tell Alice Any­thing , named after Alice Mccan – the city’s first switchboard operator. The tequila-based cocktail has refreshing watermelon, lime, agave and a serrano tincture. It’s served with a flavorful chili and salt rim. Perhaps the best, and the one that sparks the most conversation around the spacious, L-shaped bar is I Don’t Give a F…ort Myers . It’s the bar­tender’s choice. They work with the guest to create something unique and different based on their preference of flavors, spirits and mood. Just in time for Oxbow’s two-year anniversary, the restaurant introduced a new menu. Luminary Hotel marketing manager Ashley Loubier, says, “We had a limited menu after Hurricane Ian as well as limited hours, and we have fi­nally recovered. In the process, we have new chefs and a fantastic new menu.” The offerings are seafood heavy, however, not seafood exclusive. Smoked Fish Dip is an excellent way to start any meal here. The fish is smoked in-house, and the mix can change daily, depending on what the kitchen has available. The dip is served in a jar surrounded by large lavosh crackers and hot sauce for a nice kick. The Tuna Poke Bowl gets rave re­views .Besides chunks of tuna, the bowl is layered with romaine lettuce, hearts of palm and the restau­rant’s signature Carolina Gold Rice. It gets texture from pork rinds and heat from jalapeños. Oysters come raw by the dozen or as part of the Chilled Seafood Platter . It’s an ideal way to try some of everything, in­cluding the fish dip and the poke. Oysters also make a cameo in Gulf Coast Cioppino , along with mussels, lobster, shrimp and chunks of fish. The broth is coconut based, with fennel, hearts of palm and tomato. The sauce is so tempting, you might want to ask for an extra baguette to soak up any that remains. Two popular sandwiches include a Southwest Florida tradition, Grou­per and Swordfish Pastrami . On the pastrami, the meaty fish is topped with house slaw and Swiss cheese. It comes on a pretzel roll. Handhelds also include a signature Oxbow Burger . Truffle cheese is one of the things that sets this apart from most burgers. It’s served on a pretzel roll along with savory mushroom duxelles and sundried tomato aioli. Chicken wings are bone-in, breaded and tossed in a mango chili barbecue glaze. Be sure to ask about the butcher’s cut and the seafood catch of the day. You never know what the chefs have up their sleeves for these daily specials. Plant-based diners are not forgot­ten at Oxbow. The menu has beautiful salads as well as Grilled Cauliflower , and there is nothing typical about it. The cauliflower here sports red chi­michurri sauce, toasted peanuts and blistered tomatoes. Oxbow’s brunch is served on both Saturday and Sunday. It features south­  ern favorites such as fluffy biscuits, creamy grits and Southern Shakshu­ka , a hot dish with okra, pork, tomatoes and eggs. The Quiche is a delightful combination of lump crab, leek and goat cheese. While every seat in the restaurant has a view, the outside seating is popular and noteworthy. Even on warm days, it’s fun to dine on the patio with the powerful fans circulating the air for comfort. A second patio is found upstairs, reserved for special events and private parties. Oxbow also has live music on Thursday and Sunday to add to the ambiance. Check the website and social media for entertainment updates. One of the best parts of Southwest Florida is the water that surrounds the area, and there is nothing quite like din­ing with waterfront scenery. Especially when the ambiance and food are as stel­lar as that found at Oxbow Bar & Grill. Oxbow Bar & Grill is located at 1300 Hendry Street in downtown Fort Myers. Parking is available. There is both indoor and outdoor seating along with private dining and event space. Restaurant hours are Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday brunch is served from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Summer hours may vary.

ReservationS Reserve Reviews review by - Google & Yelp TOM B ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Really awesome addition to the area, there's nothing like it in the valley. Good wine list, friendly staff, and a great vibe. The place was completely full on a Sunday night, and we dined at a high-top in the bar (which we prefer anyway!). Oysters were good, pinch buns were tasty, tagliatelle (which we split) was wonderful (and homemade!) and the Brussels were really good. The patio is going to be amazing to dine on once it's open! SHANE E ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Have been here 2 times now with great food and service. I usually don't expect a new restaurant to run as smoothly as this did. The few staff members that I interacted with were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. My wife loved her cocktails. The restaurant was packed, and it seemed everyone was having a great time. We're excited to sit on the patio when it opens. Looks like it will have multiple fire pit tables! LOUIS R ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ We had a fantastic night. They offered a venison tenderloin which was a treat and excellent. Cooked to perfection. Service was knowledgeable and attentive. The general manager checked on us a couple times. We will definitely go back! JENAH M W ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Went on opening night! Beautiful building and atmosphere! Drinks were top notch, the bao buns were AMAZING!! I had the steak, it was cooked to perfection, my husband had the Carne asada and it was delicious and great presetation!! DAN Y ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ The building was gorgeous and made for a great overall atmosphere. Our server was polite, tentative, and timely. We ordered the Brussel sprouts and BLT bao buns to start which were both amazing! All I can say is make sure to order these to start- excellent!! Ron E. ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Great food and even better service.
