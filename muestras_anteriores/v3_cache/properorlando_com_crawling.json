He initially gained recognition in 2000 by winning Muzik Magazine’s “Bedroom Bedlam” competition. This victory propelled him into the professional realm, leading to a signing with Sasha’s Excession DJ agency. Zabiela’s early signature sound was a blend of breakbeat and progressive house. Over time, his style has evolved to encompass progressive house, techno, and acid house, though elements of breakbeat often remain integral to his sets. He is celebrated for his exceptional turntable skills, creative use of loops and effects, and his mastery of Pioneer CDJ equipment, often incorporating Ableton Live and various controllers, including occasionally an iPad, into his performances. His technical prowess has earned him accolades as a “technical Jedi,” consistently pushing the boundaries of DJing. This expertise has even led to a long-standing relationship with Pioneer, where he provides feedback on their new DJ hardware. Throughout his career, Zabiela has released numerous mix albums and original tracks on esteemed labels such as Renaissance and his own imprint, Born Electric, established in 2012. Born Electric has showcased music from a diverse range of artists.
