The trio—Thandi and Singh are childhood friends while Singh and Sood met in law school—are aficionados who often brew their own coffee. They launched Sleepy Owl Coffee, then a direct-to-consumer cold brew coffee brand, from a two-bedroom apartment in Delhi’s Dwarka in 2016. The company, which launched hot brew last year, claims to have about 60,000 consumers. The products are sold across more than 1,000 retail outlets in Delhi and Mumbai, which accounts for about 40 percent of the business. Online platforms—the company’s website and Amazon—make up the rest. The company claims to service 8,000 orders a month online, with an average ticket size of ₹500. Making a business out of coffee in a tea-drinking nation like India and weaning consumers off brands such as Bru and Nescafe is a tough ask.  But Thandi, Sood and Singh want to play to their strengths—superlative quality and great packaging. The trio wants to take it slow and steady. For instance, Sleepy Owl restricted itself to Delhi until early 2019 before entering Mumbai. “Both growth and cash flow are important to us. That’s why we didn’t expand rapidly,” says Thandi. Read More Over the next year, the DSG Consumer Partners-backed company—they raised $500,000 in February 2018—wants to expand to Chandigarh, Jaipur and Bengaluru. Work is underway to tap into the US and UK through Amazon. Thandi says they will close FY21 with an annualised revenue run rate of ₹35 crore. See the full Forbes India 30 Under 30 list for 2020 here “Cold brew coffee segment, with its rising popularity around the world, presents a great opportunity in the Indian market,” says Deepak Shahdadpuri, MD at DSG Consumer Partners.

Store Sign In Search for: Close search An Accessible Owl Cafe in Japan Learn More By Accessible Japan September 12, 2023 By Justin Schroth Animal cafés can be found throughout Japan, and even a fair number of them showcase owls. However, when it comes to the Tokyo area many are not accessible. Luckily there is one not too far from a popular sightseeing spot, and it has more than owls to offer, so my mother and I had to check it out. Owls Café OZ is a beautiful little well-kept café featuring several owls and other animals I was able to pet as I sipped my juice. The most obvious draw for us was the variety of owls nestled in the aviary section next to the café seating, owls which vary in size from that of softball to bigger than my head. The different breeds were amazing to see up close, and their beautiful feather patterns look more remarkable than seen in any pictures taken of them. Because of this we had a very interesting afternoon experience that wouldn’t really be possible in the United States where we came from. When we first entered the Owls Café OZ we were given a few guidelines to follow, for both the safety and well-being of us and animals alike. These rules include keeping our voice to a minimum, proper treatment of the animals, how/which animal we can touch, as well as any fees involved. Then our hour began, and we started our visit. Throughout the visit the host not only served us our drinks, chatted about the animals, but also took loving care in looking after the animals’ needs as well. My mother loves animals, so I let her hold the owls, this also gave me a close-up view of them and an opportunity for me to snap a few pictures for her. For anyone interested, admission is 1,500-yen per hour visit for 1-adult, drinks are +300-yen (A small selection of cold and hot drinks are available, no food). It is an additional fee of +300-yen to hold an owl (each) during your hour visit (a number of other animals are free to touch/hold, including rabbits, rats, lizards, and more). They are open weekends from 12:00 until 18:00, and weekdays from 13:00 until 18:00 except Wednesday when they are closed. Owls Café OZ is in Taito Ward of Tokyo ( Map ). The closest station is a 4-minute stroll to Tsukuba Express Line Asakusa Station. However, the Ginza Line Asakusa Station is a 13-minute stroll away (more if you’re shopping), it’s a popular alternative as you can see the nearby Kaminarimon Gate, shop the Nakamise Shopping Street, and visit Senso-ji Temple on the way to Owls Café OZ. Owls Café OZ is on the ground floor and has no steps or major slopes to enter the shop. It has double doors at the entry, however I found that one door was sufficient for my motorized wheelchair to enter (currently they are doing some exterior renovations to the buildings the café is located in, but this didn’t hinder accessibility). The seating area was roomy enough to turn around and it was no problem to move a chair so I could sit next to one of the tables. The aviary area entry door is a bit slim, so entering it with a wheelchair (like mine) may not be possible if all you want to do is look (the alternative isn’t free, but my mother was able to hold the owls in the café area so we could get an up-close look). Also, the restroom entry is accessed through the aviary with a similar slim door, so I’d recommend using a station toilet if you need a universal restroom prior to your visit. There are plenty of seats available for those who need to sit more than stand, and the aviary section is viewable from this area by large glass windows. If you still want to look up-close, it is possible to hold an owl at the table (for the holding fee) if you don’t want to stand in the aviary section. There’s also an outside seating area, however holding owls here may not be available. Children may be able to get a discount depending on their age, otherwise price and fees are determined by what you choose to do. If you are a fan of Owls and animals in general, I would recommend Owls Café OZ as a perfect quiet time-out from busy Tokyo. It is very accessible, and the host was very welcoming. It is a perfect stop to relax when exploring all that Asakusa has to offer.

It’s not exactly pleasant, and nothing like the smell of a freshly brewed cuppa — no, it’s not quite there yet — but it is thrilling. It’s the scent of anticipation. From this, good coffee comes. “Good coffee” is what Thomas Ooi believes in. Hailing originally from Sitiawan, the 33-year-old opened Owls Café in August 2014. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement To ensure a regular supply of coffee beans roasted to his liking, Ooi started his own roastery, Ghostbird Coffee Company, in December 2015. Malaysian-grown Arabica coffee beans from Sabah. For years, Ghostbird was very much an internal affair, supplying beans only to Ooi’s various cafés. (There are now seven outlets in total: two in Bukit Jalil; one each in PJ, USJ, Mytown, Trec and Kuching.) Today, Ghostbird has expanded to doing wholesale and providing their beans to other cafés and shops. But coffee is a competitive market and price sensitive with razor-thin margins. What makes them stand out? After all, the definition of “good coffee” is kind of subjective, isn’t it? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Ooi offers their take: “Ghostbird offers a variety of single origin beans and blends that are positioned between commodity and specialty coffees. Take our signature Milky Way espresso blend: As black coffee, it has low bitterness and barely any acidity; as milk coffee, it’s chocolatey and Milo-like.” Some might argue Ghostbird has priced its beans too low and thus risks spoiling the market for other roasters. Ooi disagrees, explaining that “while others might portray themselves as specialty coffee purveyors, that’s not what we are claiming. Instead what we want to do is capture the sweet spot between low-cost commodity and premium-priced specialty.” After roasting (left), the beans are sorted once more to check for defects (right). But what is commodity coffee and what is considered specialty? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to Ooi, specialty coffee ought to be: Firstly, single origin beans; secondly, beans that score 80 points and above on a 100-point grading scale as per Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) protocol; and thirdly, of light to medium roasting. “Typically, specialty coffee purveyors will look for around 83 to 85 points for their beans. Most importantly, you don’t do dark roasts if you’re talking about specialty beans. Beans for filter coffee ought to be light roast and for espresso blends a light to medium roast.” The perfect grind. A darker roast, Ooi opines, would produce “a more roasted flavour, like what you’d get at Starbucks. By contrast, specialty coffee ought to have the bean’s original flavour or ‘coffee as it is’ — an Ethiopian bean would have a jasmine aroma and a floral, honey sweetness, for example.” Here is where consumer expectations come into play. Ooi says, “In reality, customers generally prefer a roasting flavour; we grew up drinking Milo and kopi O kaw after all. We can get this flavour by roasting further, until we turn the sugars in the beans into caramel. You get more of a toffee and hazelnut flavour.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Yet café hoppers aren’t entering a shop with flat whites and Americanos on the menu and be satisfied with being served what tastes like Milo and kopi O kaw , are they? Hence the question of balance. Ooi says, “Ghostbird is doing neither commodity nor specialty coffee as this would limit our product offerings. But how can we sell at competitive pricing yet provide our wholesale customers with good coffee that they can serve their own customers?” The answer, apparently, lies with how beans are graded. Ooi explains, “We mainly source for beans graded at 80 points, sometimes even 79 points. This is literally the border between commodity and specialty coffee. But a few points make a huge impact on pricing.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The average market price for 80-82 point green beans is RM25-30 per kilogram while 83-85 point beans cost RM28-50 per kilogram, depending on the origin and coffee variety. The difference results in significant cost savings. Michael Tan, a veteran barista and Ghostbird’s Wholesale Director showing how it’s done. Ooi says, “Currently Ghostbird’s Milky Way blend is priced at RM80 per kilogram compared to the market price of RM90-RM120 per kilogram. We pass the savings to our wholesale customers, the café owners, and then through our Ghostbird Academy offer free training to their staff on how to brew a better cup of coffee with our beans of this grade.” It all begins at Ghostbird’s roastery and headquarters in Seputeh. Michael Tan, a veteran barista and Ghostbird’s Wholesale Director, shows me around the space which is more than just the roasting machine. Here is where they store their green beans, including Malaysian grown Arabica coffee beans from Sabah. There is their production room where the roasted beans are packaged for delivery. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With 80 point beans, there must be some trade-offs in terms of quality. Tan says, “Ghostbird sorts the beans twice — once at the roasting stage, and once again before the beans are packaged — to remove defective beans.” Naturally the percentage of defects would be higher than for 83 point beans. At Ghostbird, for every 5 kilograms of beans, they remove about 15 grams of defective beans, which is considered reasonable by industry standards. Tan adds, “Also we do a medium-dark roast, one notch above specialty coffee which goes only as far as a medium roast. That’s only an issue if we brand ourselves as specialty coffee, which we don’t. As long as the coffee is balanced and not too bitter, it’s what our customers are after.” Clearly the strategy is working. Since late last year, Ghostbird has increased their wholesale accounts from 68 to 79 customers. And this is up from only four customers the year before. Ooi shares, “We do an average of 10 kilograms per week per customer. Some own multiple shops so they can reach as high as 100 kilograms per week.” Ghostbird offers a variety of single origin beans and blends that are positioned between commodity and specialty coffees. Next up for Ghostbird is their expansion into the coffee kiosk business, a smaller setup compared to full-sized cafés with the accompanying lower cost and agility; far easier to pack up and shift to new locations if the foot traffic turns out to be low. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Another development would be distributor accounts. Tan says, “We will partner with a few cafés in different states and regions so others can go to them and buy Ghostbird beans and receive training. We’re starting with one in Ipoh for the north and one in Seremban for the south, but eventually hope to expand to every state having its own Ghostbird hub.” Which makes sense as the nation is not reducing its caffeine intake anytime soon. Ghostbird went from roasting 300 kilograms of coffee beans per month only a year ago, mainly for Owl Café outlets, to now doing 3 tonnes of monthly sales. Make no mistake about it: a new goldmine in “good coffee” is up for grabs.
