Originally opened in 1981, the renowned PGA National Resort offers 360 guest rooms and 99 holes of championship golf, including the famed Champion Course, the host since 2007 to a PGA TOUR event now called The Cognizant Classic which is broadcast by NBC and The Golf Channel at the end of February. With a total of six stellar golf courses designed by Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Fazio, Andy Staples and Karl Litten, the resort has staged the 1983 Ryder Cup, the 1987 PGA Championship, and multiple Senior PGA Championships. The resort also showcases a 40,000-square-foot spa designed by V Starr, six culinary concepts spearheaded by The Butcher’s Club from “Top Chef” winner Jeremy Ford and Honeybelle from multiple James Beard Award nominee Lindsay Autry, and a state-of-the-art Sports & Racquet Club. Building on a recently completed $100 million renovation, new ownership will embark on further improvements, including the addition of a new pool and significant enrichments to the golf experience for both members and resort guests. The 807-acre property was purchased in a joint venture partnership with Salamander Collection, the luxury hotel company, which will manage the resort. South Street Partners will provide general asset management services. Nick Weber, CEO and Founder of Henderson Park: “PGA National Resort is a storied property in a growing and highly desirable sub-market, with further opportunistic potential following a recently completed renovation. Our experience executing across both premier destination resort hotels and one-of-a-kind club memberships uniquely positions Henderson Park as the new owner and we will work with our partners to enhance the resort’s offering into the future.” Rob Duckett, Henderson Park Managing Director, Golf and Club Operations: “We are very excited to be stewards of PGA National, historically one of the most dynamic golf destinations in the US. Our plans include further enhancing the facilities while enriching the experience provided to our members and guests.” Sheila Johnson, Salamander Collection Founder and CEO : “PGA National Resort is one of the most iconic golf resorts in America and we are excited to share our authentic and diverse style of hospitality which guests enjoy at our other destinations.” Henderson Park was advised by Jones Day.
