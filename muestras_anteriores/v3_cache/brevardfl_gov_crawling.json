      "text": "Canova Beach Park: Dog-friendly Florida beach review Subscribe Sign in Canova Beach Park: Dog-friendly Florida beach review From the perspective of a reactive dog owner Haley Young Aug 16, 2020 Share A few months after we moved to Florida, we went on a camping trip about an hour south of our apartment in the Viera area and found ourselves near Canova Dog Beach. We regularly take our Australian cattle dog, Scout, to Cocoa Beach’s dog-friendly stretch — so we were excited to try out another area! We didn’t like it quite as much as our usual spot, but it still has its merits as one of the only dog-friendly beaches in Brevard County . Here’s our complete review of what it’s like to take our blue heeler to Canova Beach Park . Canova Beach Park at a glance We truthfully aren’t the biggest fans of Canova beach’s dog-friendly area. It’s quite small, which often means it’s crowded — and therefore not ideal for dogs who aren’t very comfortable with strange people and dogs in their space. We’ve also seen at least one off-leash dog every time we’ve gone, despite posted leash laws . Our favorite things about Canova Beach Park’s dog-friendly area: Dogs are allowed throughout the entire day Leashes are required at all times The parking lot is large and easily accessible There is a rinsing station and restroom facilities The entire park is gorgeous! Our least favorite things: It’s a very small stretch of beach, making it hard to get space from others Many owners violate leash laws — we need to be vigilant and ready to advocate for our dog The waves are usually too big for dogs to properly swim in If you go, make sure you bring: A waterproof collar (or one you don’t mind getting dirty) A sturdy leash A towel or two Drinking water Extra waste disposal bags Food or a toy to reward good behavior An attitude ready to be approached by others in close proximity Pet corrector, citronella spray, pepper gel, or another deterrent for off-leash dogs The details of Canova Beach Park Where are dogs allowed? The entire park is 9.1 acres, but dogs are only allowed on a stretch that’s maybe 100 yards long. There’s a separate staircase to get down to the sand, and it’s clearly labeled. When are dogs allowed? Dogs are allowed all times the park is open, from dawn to dusk. What restrictions are there for dogs? Dogs must be leashed, and owners must clean up after their pets. More information, including any timely updates, can be found on Brevard County’s website ! Getting to Canova Beach Park Canova Beach Park is in Brevard County on Florida’s Space Coast. It’s north of Melbourne Beach, south of Satellite Beach, and southeast of Orlando. The park has a sizeable parking lot complete with restrooms and, best of all, a rinsing station for dogs and their gear. Take a short walk to the sand A short path goes from the parking lot to the actual beach. There is a grassy area off to the left (facing the beach) where your dog can use the bathroom. A cute little picnic table sits under a pavilion here, as well — if you need to take a quick breather out of the sun, it’s the perfect place! Be prepared to be approached by other dogs There are a lot of things we like about Canova Beach Park. Unfortunately, this one is a bit of a deal-breaker for our fear reactive blue heeler : The beach is often crowded with other dogs… some of them not on a leash or even under verbal control. If you get there early, you’ll definitely be able to set up camp with a few towels or chairs. Just know that other people and dogs will be passing in close proximity, and there’s a chance one of them might approach all the way into your space. When we’ve gone, we’ve thankfully been able to avoid any direct contact by being vigilant and frequently moving around. Despite our best efforts, though, we’ve still had other dogs get within a few feet of us every time. All in all, a decent option for confident, neutral dogs We don’t plan to return to Canova dog beach very often. There are other places to explore that better suit all of our needs! With that said, I believe the park can be a perfectly decent option for confident, neutral dogs — especially if you want to get some good distraction training in. Know your dog before you go, be prepared to advocate for them if the need arises, and have some fun in the sun.

Ivan Thompson Chair of Fundraising and Communications Committee Ivan evolved a passion for the people and places of British Columbia’s wild salmon ecosystem into his life’s primary work. By fortunate accident, in 1981 he came to live in the mighty Skeena watershed. Had he been able to find his first teaching job further south, he probably would have taken it. Instead, he moved to a village on the wilderness shores of Lake Babine. Over the next two decades, he fell more and more deeply in love with the area as he explored much of the Skeena, the Stikine and the North Coast while working as a teacher, outdoor instructor, counsellor, and college director. Ivan engaged with northern BC communities in the land use planning initiatives of the nineties that led to a doubling of the BC’s protected areas network, and later with North Coast indigenous communities in accessing conservation financing to enable their environmental and economic visions for the Great Bear Rainforest. For most of the past two decades, he has helped guide philanthropic foundations in investing in protection of healthy lands and waters as the heart of life and livelihoods in BC. Ivan worked as program officer with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation from 2007 to 2017 and then as senior advisor with MakeWay’s Pacific Salmon Watershed’s Fund until 2022. He continues to advise and facilitate relationships amongst philanthropic, government, indigenous and NGO leaders through his roles of practitioner fellow at the University of Victoria’s Centre for Global Studies and of trustee with the boards of the BC Parks Foundation and the Portland-based Wild Salmon Centre.

Champions Robert Bateman Founding Member & Champion In many ways parks have made me who I am. As an Ontario boy, I thought of Algonquin Park as a kind of Nirvana. It denoted wilderness and nature in a pure form. Wolves roamed there. When I landed a job, ages 17-19, doing “chores” at the research station, I thought I’d died and gone to heaven. It also became apparent that the people who worked in parks, the rangers and naturalists, were an important part of the scene. They appreciate and protect nature for others to enjoy. These people became my role models. BC parks are among the most spectacular in the world because this province is blessed with a great variety of natural habitats from mountains to marine. We need to use them or lose them but at the same time we must not love them to death with too many amenities. It will take vigilance and budgets to guarantee that our parks will be as beneficial to future generations as they are to us. Wade Davis My life took a turn at 15 when I spent a summer in Manning Park, working as a member of the Youth Crew, building trails, fighting fires, maintaining the campgrounds. Splitting firewood in the sun, with room and board and three dollars a day the only financial reward, taught me that work is not about money; it's about pride, strength, perseverance and grit, values that would forge the foundation of my professional life. Altogether, I worked eight seasons for BC Parks, culminating in a much coveted position as the first park ranger in the Spatsizi Plateau, British Columbia's largest wilderness park. My job description was deliciously vague; public relations and wilderness assessment. In two four month seasons my partner and I encountered not a dozen visitors, leaving us free to wander, as we mapped the trails, surveyed the wildlife, ran the rivers, and established routes up all the major peaks. This prolonged apprenticeship with the Parks, all that I learned in E.C. Manning and Naikoon, Mount Assiniboine, Atlin Mountain, Mount Edziza, and Spatsizi Plateau, left me with both a deep appreciation of nature, and a profound sense of belonging, a spirit of place that is the essence of Canadian patriotism. In good measure, I owe my life and career to BC Parks. Surely the opportunities that I had in my youth, the chance to unburden an adolescent mind and reward the body with hard physical work, to experience for the first time the true miracle of nature, to seek the promise of transformation, even transcendence, as found only in the wild heart of the world, ought to be part of the birthright of every new generation of British Columbians. Ben Haggar Freelance photographer, writer, and content creator Spending time recreating in nature was a keystone of my upbringing and set me on a path to appreciate and help to protect wild places. Connecting with nature allows me to feel centred and balanced within myself. When I moved to BC from Ontario at age 19, I was overwhelmed at the scale of the fog cloaked mountains, old growth cedars, and cold green waves rolling in towards pristine beaches. With so much incredible diversity, I couldn’t believe that the entire province wasn’t one huge provincial park! I feel incredibly lucky for the recreational opportunities here in BC. From surfing Naikoon in Haida Gwaii, bikepacking the South Chilcotins, ski touring at Kokanee, and climbing the Squamish Chief and Garibaldi from my front door. It gives me real peace of mind knowing that these special areas are protected and that there is an endless supply of new discoveries and experiences to be had right here at home in BC. Greg Hill Skier, film maker, climber, and sustainable adventurer Many of my most memorable moments were in the parks in British Columbia. I have savored my freedom moving through the mountains, contemplated life surrounded by giant cedars and finished days watching the sun set into the Pacific Ocean. These parks are the identity of BC and need to be protected and preserved for our kids and theirs, while also enjoyed by us. John Montalbano My family did not have very many luxuries. Growing up as a child in East Vancouver, our weekend family time was exploring the numerous parks to the north and east of Vancouver. Free access to parks was essential for my parents to entertain and educate my sister and me. I love our parks to this day. Dr. Sally Otto From Ruckle Provincial Park in the Garry oak ecosystem to the glacier-fed lakes of Mount Assiniboine, the parks of British Columbia are truly majestic. Camping in these parks allows families, like mine, to experience nature directly and to pass along to our children a love of wildlife. The parks are also a critical refuge for the most endangered animals and plants. BC is home to the most species diversity of any province in Canada but also home to the most species at risk. Without well managed parks, we are likely to lose dozens, if not hundreds, of the animal and plant species that make BC so special. Eric Peterson Founding Member and Champion I was born in Port Alberni and grew up on Vancouver Island. That was the era when family vacations meant packing the camping gear into the trunk of the Buick and heading off down one BC's brand new highways. It was pure exploration and discovery - the Cariboo, the Slocan Valley, the Big Bend highway, the Chilcotin - exploring the wonders of the province by day, and pulling in for the night at a BC Parks campground. Those experiences kindled my love of exploration and new vistas, which took me around the world as a scientist (biology PhD) then later as a technology entrepreneur. I founded the BC-based Tula Foundation in 2002 and set up Tula’s Hakai Institute in 2010. Hakai develops the tools, systems, people and insights we need to understand our coastal ecosystems in the context of climate change, and to deal with the consequences that are coming. We operate field stations at remote locations on the BC coast. We have our own scientific staff plus a large network that includes university researchers, government scientists and First Nations. For the past eight years we have enjoyed a very close and productive partnership with BC Parks via our Calvert Island field station, which is located in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest. Strategic Advisors Miro Ceretnig Yee Chan Bob Kronbauer Garry Mancell Roy Millen “ BC's parks are a stream flowing from the original earth, through our hands, to the future. ” Andy Day, CEO Subscribe to our newsletter today.

Natural Resources Beaches Beach Management Program Beach Management Program The Brevard County Beach Management Program administers several beach restoration projects that place beach quality sand and native dune vegetation along the Atlantic shoreline to protect upland property and maintain healthy beaches to be enjoyed by residents, tourists, and wildlife. Because healthy beaches are essential to Brevard's tourism-based economy, the Tourist Development Council has dedicated a portion of the bed tax (collected from hotels and motels) to fund the local cost share of most County beach management projects. Current Beach Project Updates There are four segments of shoreline along the Brevard County coastline between Jetty Park and Sebastian Inlet with County beach and dune restoration projects. The area within the boundaries of Patrick Space Force base is federal and does not fall within any of the County projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers manages the Federal Shore Protection Project, and Brevard County is the local sponsor.  The Federal Project encompasses three sections of shoreline: The North Reach spans 9.8 miles between the Port Canaveral Jetty and the northern border of Patrick Space Force Base The 7.6 mile Mid Reach begins at the southern border of Patrick Space Force Base and extends south to Flug Avenue, Indialantic The 3.8 mile South Reach begins at Flug Avenue, Indialantic and extends south to Spessard Holland Park North. The South Beaches is a non-federal county between Spessard Holland South and Sebastian Inlet State Park. In response to Hurricane Ian and Tropical Storm Nicole restoration work in the Mid Reach and South Reach , as well as the South Beaches , began in 2023-24 and was restarted in November 2024 after the summer sea turtle nesting season. Sand placement work in the North Reach is also currently underway. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is managing the Mid Reach and South Reach projects, and their contractor Dutra Group, is staging equipment between Spessard Holland North and South Parks. The two parks will generally remain open during this work but the beach area between them may be closed at times. Spessard Holland South will always remain open. Mid Reach sand was delivered by truck through upland staging areas. Sand placement began on December 2, 2024, and was completed March 12, 2025.   Sand placement work on the beach is complete. Brevard County is installing sea oats and similar plants throughout the Mid Reach on the newly constructed dune slopes.  Planting is completed south of Gemini Park in Satellite Beach, with the final segment from Gemini Park to Pineda Causeway to be planted in late April 2025. The South Reach , between Spessard Holland Park and Flug Avenue, is contracted for nourishment but because of mechanical problems with the Contractor’s dredge the schedule has been delayed and it is most likely the South Reach nourishment will not start until November 2025 to be completed prior to April 30, 2026. Updates will be provided when available. Mid Reach and South Reach progress maps can be seen here: Olsen-Associates The North Reach , between Jetty Park and Patrick Space Force Base is being nourished between January 2025 and April 30, 2025.  Work is being done in combination with the Canaveral Harbor Sand Bypass. Additional information can be found here: Port Canaveral The South Beaches is the southern segment of Brevard County’s shoreline and extends south from Spessard Holland Park to Sebastian Inlet. Brevard County completed South Beaches sand placement in March 2024. In January/February 2025, Brevard County is installing sea oats and similar native plants throughout the South Beaches along the sandy dune slope constructed last year. Progress updates will continue to be posted here regularly while the project is still underway. Hotline Number (321) 574-8855. Dune Vegetation No dune restoration project is truly complete without the replenishment of native vegetation. The reintroduction\r\n            of native vegetation helps to restore the beach / dune ecosystem.

Unlock unlimited digital access to floridatoday.com Click here and subscribe today. Canine owners, take note: The town of Indialantic appears poised to designate a dog-friendly beach — the third in Brevard County — at Sunrise Park on a six-month trial basis. Sunrise Park is a 1.8-acre beach recreation area at State Road A1A and Watson Drive, across the highway from the Indialantic Publix that opened in June 2020. Dogs had been prohibited from nearly all of Brevard's 72 miles of beaches since at least the early 1990s. After heated debate, the Brevard County Commission established the 700-foot dog-friendly stretch of Canova Beach Park in 2012. Canova Beach Park is located within the Indialantic ZIP code — but Sunrise Park lies 3 miles to the south along the barrier island, within Indialantic town limits. Cocoa Beach unveiled a dog-friendly stretch of beach in 2018. Dogs are allowed on the sand from 4th Street South to the north side of Robert P. Murkshe Memorial Park from 6 to 10 a.m. and from 4 to 7 p.m., with longer hours during daylight savings time. More: Margaritaville complex planned in Melbourne with hotel, restaurants, marina More: Six-level Element hotel proposed next door to Crowne Plaza, raising A1A crosswalk concerns On Dec. 8, the Indialantic Town Council voted 3-2 to approve first reading of an ordinance designating the Sunrise Park dog-friendly beach for a six-month test run. Council members will vote on a second, final reading on Jan. 12. If approved, the dog beach would debut Feb. 1 and continue through Aug. 1, after which council members would resume discussion. Mayor Dave Berkman, Julie McKnight and Doug Wright voted yes on Dec. 8, while Deputy Mayor Stu Glass and Simon Kemp voted no. Among the rules: Dogs would be permitted on the beach from sunrise until two hours after sunrise, and from two hours before sunset until sunset. Dogs would have to be leashed. Maximum length: 10 feet. Dog owners would have to immediately pick up pet waste. \"It will be a dog-friendly area between the signs. They have to be on a leash,\" Indialantic Town Manager Michael Casey said. Owners \"have to pick up after themselves. If your dog has ever been ruled a dangerous dog, they can't have them on the beach.\" \"And they'll have to keep holding the leash,\" he said. Casey said Indialantic police would monitor the dog beach.  Sunrise Park already is a dog-friendly park, but the animals are not allowed on the sand today. \"We’ll see how it works out. If there's any issues, we're going to tweak things and make any adjustments,\" Casey said. Cocoa Beach unveiled a dog-friendly stretch of beach in 2018. Dogs are allowed on the sand from 4th Street South to the north side of Robert P. Murkshe Memorial Park from 6 to 10 a.m. and from 4 to 7 p.m., with longer hours during daylight savings time. Casey said he has discussed dog-beach regulations and oversight with Cocoa Beach Police Chief Scott Rosenfeld.
