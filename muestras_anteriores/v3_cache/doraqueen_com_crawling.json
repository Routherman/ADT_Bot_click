About the Dora Queen Brian and Brandy Herron wanted a way for locals and tourists to enjoy the beauty of Lake Dora while offering a unique experience. Their goal is to add to the charm of the community with a fun and enjoyable new attraction. In 2017, they had the idea to seek out the old paddlewheel boat that was originally parked on the Dead River in Tavares.  This boat was special to them because they had their wedding rehearsal dinner on it almost 20 years prior.  They were quickly connected with Robbie Cunningham, owner of the boat.  After seeing it, they knew they wanted to purchase it and their vision began from there. The Dora Contessa, the original paddlewheel boat was powered by two 90 horsepower engines and could carry up to 49 passengers.  Now named the Dora Queen she is 80 feet long and 35 feet wide. The Dora Queen is powered by two 250 horsepower engines and has the capacity for 70 passengers.  Commissioned and built by Robbie Cunningham at Trident Pontoons in Tavares, Florida, the construction of the vessel took over two years.  The original paddlewheel and helm are still a part of the vessel today. The Dora Queen has two levels of lounge style seating and a state of the art sound system.  So sit back, relax and enjoy all the majestic views that Lake Dora has to offer.

      "text": "Dora Queen makes grand arrival in Tavares’ Wooton Park News Sports Entertainment Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals TAVARES Dora Queen makes grand arrival in Tavares’ Wooton Park Roxanne Brown roxanne.brown@dailycommercial.com TAVARES – Now that the Dora Queen has arrived at Wooton Park, it is undergoing its final transformation. Soon it will debut as a tourist attraction downtown Tavares offering something unique: steamboat rides. “There is still a lot we have to do but we’re working hard to get it done as soon as possible,” said Brian Herron, who with his wife, Brandy Herron, own the 1800s paddle-wheel steamboat replica. “We’re hoping for spring,” “We’re excited,” he continued. “We’re one step closer and it’s already getting a lot of interest.” The Herrons’ dream business, registered with the state as Steamboat Cruises, Inc., was first pitched to the city about two years ago. The paddlewheels for it however, were set in motion towards its reality nearly 20 years ago. Brian and Brandy had been thinking about purchasing a boat they could use for excursions for some time. Then, one day, they ran across the Dora Contessa, the boat they used as the venue for their rehearsal dinner 19 years prior. So they purchased it. Today, parts of the original 49-passenger steamboat, including the bright red paddlewheel and gangway, have been incorporated into what they have now dubbed the Dora Queen. It will soon be a Coast Guard certified, 149-passenger, doubledecker steamboat with two bars, a state-of-the-art sound system, lounge seating and more. When finished, the Dora Queen will be used for special events and day tours between Tavares and Mount Dora. Once operational, people will be able to board the boat at either city. “Everyday, people are coming to the dock thinking they can board the boat now, but we still have a ways to go,” Brian said. “It’s a process.” Too big to move in one piece, the Dora Queen, was taken apart last week and moved from Trident Pontoon Boats, Inc. where it was being built, to the dock on Lake Dora at Wooton Park West. For now, Trident Pontoon’s Owner Robbie Cunningham will continue working on building one of the bars, connecting all the wiring for the helm and pilot house and installing the gangway. “There was a lot of stuff we couldn’t begin doing until it was moved to its destination because it’s too high and once built, like the bar, which is fixed, would have been impossible to remove,” Brian said. Additionally, the Dora Queen still has Coast Guard inspections stability tests to clear, he said. Bob Tweedie, Tavares’ Economic Development Director, said that since the boat was moved to Tavares, people have been snapping photos and watching as work continues. He said a good size crowd got an eyeful when a big crane lowered the boat’s top deck right onto to the bottom deck. Tweedie said with that kind of interest already, he can only imagine the excitement when the Dora Queen is ready to set out on its maiden voyage. He said he does not know of another place in Lake County where people can attend a special event at a waterfront pavilion, play at a park, playground and splash pad, jump on a train, a seaplane and now, a steamboat. “It (the Dora Queen) will make a real positive and beneficial impact on our waterfront entertainment district,” Tweedie said. “It’s a great new offering that will complement what we already have down here.” Tavares resident Nancy Sardana agrees. The more choices, activity-wise for people, the better, she said. “Having the steamboat rides will be really nice. It will be a pleasure here, especially for kids and families,” Sardana said. “Also, there are some people who don’t want to go on a plane so the steamboat is another way for them to enjoy a tour on the lake. People will love it.” Tweedie said besides that, however, there’s another Dora Queen draw. “Not only will it have a positive economic impact as a business, it was built by a local business and that’s pretty cool,” Tweedie said.

John Jeffries John Jeffries Corporate Director of Food and Beverage John started working in hotels as a Banquet Setup Houseman while attending West Virginia University, as it was âjust a good job for beer money.â Since starting in that position 20 years ago, he discovered his passion for hospitality and creating memorable experiences, and food and beverage to be a great avenue to deliver those experiences. He has held almost every position in the food and beverage world while climbing the ladder, working for some great companies, and learning from even better food and beverage professionals in the industry. While in Denver, he was the Food and Beverage Supervisor of a 422-room, $8 million food and beverage operation at the Westin Denver Downtown. From there, he was a Food and Beverage Manager of a 250-room Hilton Garden Inn with a Colorado-themed specialty restaurant. He has also been Director of Event Operations for the Crowne Plaza Denver Airport, overseeing 90,000 square feet of meeting space. In 2017, he opened his first hotel as Director of Food and Beverage of the Moxy Denver Cherry Creek, which at the time was only the fourth Moxy in the United States. The hotel was a pilot to serve several crucial changes in the brand, which played a pivotal role in helping Marriott grow to more than 40-plus Moxy hotels. Due to the success of opening Moxy, he assisted his previous company in four additional openings while still leading the Moxy food and beverage team. In 2021, he was promoted to Regional Director of Food and Beverage and moved to Chattanooga, Tenn., where he oversaw 18 properties across multiple brands with revenues exceeding $16 million. John joined the Dora Hotel Company team in June 2024.
