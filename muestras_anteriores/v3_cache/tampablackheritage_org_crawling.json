By the time he got around to releasing his solo debut, 2004's critically acclaimed Bone Deep, he had shared the stage with such industry luminaries as Michael Jackson, Earth, Wind & Fire, Patti Labelle, Erykah Badu, and countless others. Bone Deep made him a festival circuit mainstay, and he spent the next eight years refining his signature smooth and immediate sound in both a solo setting and in support of artists like Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, the Roots, and Jill Scott. In 2012 he released his sophomore long-player, Bone Appetit, which featured a host of guest artists, including Kindred the Family Soul, Raheem DeVaughn, Floacist, and Marsha Ambrosius. Jeff Bradshaw Website Raheem DeVaughn TBBHF Music Fest Performer Sunday, April 27, 2025 Raheem DeVaughn The son of an accomplished avant-garde jazz cellist, Raheem DeVaughn is an urban R&B singer and songwriter who gets inspiration from the great crooners of the past such as Marvin Gaye, to more contemporary singers like D'Angelo. With two albums and a Grammy nomination, DeVaughn's musical style leans as much as it does towards neo-soul and R&B as it does towards a timeless soul sound he hopes to create through his musical legacy. Rather than having critics or record labels define his sound, DeVaughn came up with his own genre which he describes as, \"R&B/hippie/neo-soul/rockstar in a hip-hop world,\" he affirmed to Vibe writer Shayla Byrd. A DeVaughn fan and fellow musician, Alicia Keys, told journalist Clarence Waldron of Jet, \"Raheem is a gem …. He embodies the soul and raw honesty of the legendary artists we long for.\" Raheem DeVaughn Website Eric Roberson TBBHF Music Fest Performer Sunday, April 27, 2025 Eric Roberson An American singer, songwriter, former rapper and music producer.
