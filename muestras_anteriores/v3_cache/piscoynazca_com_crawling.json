At the same time, we fully acknowledge the heightened concerns many have with regard to health and general sanitary conditions. With this in mind, we would like to let our guests know how we have addressed our operations with regard to COVID-19 protections. With regard to guest service and seating: 1) A sanitizer station has been provided for all guests to use prior to being seated. 2) Our dining room has been reconfigured to allow for a comfortable distance between each party. 3) Reservation timing has been modified to ensure guests can be immediately seated upon arrival, eliminating the possibility of clustering. 4) QR menus will be provided, and paper menus upon request. All paper menus will be discarded after a single use. Menus in plastic sleeves will be sanitized after each use. 5) General surfaces throughout the restaurant will be sanitized on a monitored schedule throughout each day. 6) Dining tables, chairs, and booths will be sanitized after each seating. 7) All plate ware, glassware, and flatware undergo high temperature and chemical sanitizing as part of our warewashing process. 8) Upon request, we can offer disposable cutlery and food containers if any guest would feel more comfortable using these items. With regard to our team members. In addition to the rigorous existing health standards already in place in all licensed food service establishments, we are doing the following:1) All team members undergo a temperature check upon arrival to the restaurant each day. Any team member with a temperature in excess of 99 degrees will be immediately sent home. 2) All team members will wear face masks at all times while working. 3) All culinary team members will wear gloves at all times, changing gloves between tasks. 4) Service team members will not wear gloves on the floor. Due to the nature of their tasks, it is more effective and more sanitary for our servers, bartenders, and support staff to maintain rigorous hand-washing protocols. 5) In the unlikely case that a team member begins to exhibit any signs of illness of any kind, while working, they will immediately be sent home, and will not return to work until cleared by a physician. Together we can be safe.

We were greeted by a manager and he summoned a hostess, who sat us immediately. Our server Luis came to our table and explained the house specialties. Extra points for indicating we were still eligible for half-priced drinks until 7 PM! Soon thereafter, we ordered the grilled octopus as an appetizer. After our cold beers arrived, we ordered our entrees. Since Pisco y Nazca is known as a ceviche gastro bar, we decided to stick with their tried-and-true ceviche. A short wait later, we were served the octopus. It was marvelous and I was inspired to order another beer before the end of their Hora Loca (Happy Hour). Not long after, our ceviche was served. My Aji Amarillo was nearly perfect, the only flaw was it could have used a little more heat. My date was somewhat disappointed with her Ceviche Sampler. The traditional was a little salty and the passion fruit one was a bit too sweet, though the creamy option was up to her lofty standards. We devoured our meals but chose to skip dessert. I look forward to my next visit! Name: Daniela Conn Occupation: Teacher Lives In: Plantation Restaurant Pick: Etzel Itzik Reviewed: Pisco y Nazca Driving into the shops of Doral it was obvious that it was newly built with several restaurant options. The weather was beautiful the day we ate here so the restaurant had opened its large glass doors. The decor was very modern and the bar took center stage. As we were say we passed by the open kitchen and were able to see the chefs working. The server was very knowledgeable and recommended the brunch sampler, which for $25 was quite the bargain. The food came out promptly and as we dined, two separate managers came to check on our dishes and one even described the process of how they made the ceviche I ordered. There was so much food that I was able to take home leftovers. I have already recommended this place to several friends and plan on visiting it again. Name: Marc Shomberg Occupation: Closing Manager-Real Estate Title Company Lives In: : Fort Lauderdale, FL Restaurant Pick: Fra Diavolo Reviewed: Pisco y Nazca The location is has a modern open floor plan. The patio doors open fully to where the inside and outside can become one. Parking is easy in the parking garage and the place was packed on Saturday night. They not only had the guests at tables and the bar, but had a private holiday party going on as well. Even with all of the energy, the food and service was excellent. I eat a lot of Peruvian food and I was unexpectedly impressed. I’m going back in two weeks for the octopus although everything that we ate was great.
