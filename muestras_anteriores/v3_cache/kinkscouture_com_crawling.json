Peter Prato / Special to The Chronicle Alison Boden, CEO of Cybernet Entertainment, which runs the online fetish and BDSM site Kink.com, photographed in the Kink.com headquarters in San Francisco, California, on May 9th, 2018. Peter Prato / Special to The Chronicle Kink.com has seen plenty of belt-tightening over the years, with people tied to objects like chairs in the name of bondage. But recently the straps have become snugger financially, too, as free pornography has dug into its business. Now, the bondage video company — part of San Francisco’s tech and sex scene — is undergoing a transformation, with a new CEO, a different headquarters and a shift from porn video production to content distribution and e-commerce. “We have had a couple of hard years, and we had to make some difficult choices,” CEO Alison Boden told The Chronicle. “Now we are focused on having the platform for folks to find the best fetish and (bondage- and sadomasochism-related) content.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Boden, 35, took over the top spot in March from Peter Acworth, the bondage enthusiast who founded the company, officially known as Cybernet Entertainment, 21 years ago. The change follows the sale by Acworth of Kink’s former headquarters, the historic Armory in the Mission District , for $65 million. That deal, which closed in January, netted Acworth more than four times what he paid in 2006 for the 200,000-square-foot castle-style structure. Acworth has stepped away from day-to-day operations to focus on his real estate development and management business. “If there is anyone who can reinvent Kink.com for the new internet, which is awash with free content, it is her,” Acworth said in a statement. “I’ve relied on her judgment and intuition for years.” The changes have ended an “only in San Francisco” era, said Carol Queen, founder and director for the city’s Center for Sex and Culture. A detail of merchandise in the basement of the new headquarters of Kink.com in San Francisco, California, on May 9th, 2018. Peter Prato / Special to The Chronicle In a city with a long history that included the bondage support group Society of Janus and the annual Folsom Street Fair , the Armory under Acworth’s reign “was clearly the kinky Playboy mansion of the 21st century,” Queen said. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Boden, who was vice president of technology, is optimistic that she can turn around a company whose “mission statement isn’t about corporate profits, but ending stigma.” She takes over at a time when growth of subscription revenue for online pornography has slowed due to the proliferation of free porn. The $568.3 million adult porn website industry grew about 10.4 percent annually during the past five years, but that rate is expected to slow to about 3.7 percent annually for the next five years, according to a March report from IBISWorld. Subscription fees account for about three-fourths of that revenue, but the “vast majority of porn consumers do not pay for content,” the report said. “We’re trying to look and see what directions we can grow beyond subscriptions,” Boden said. “That’s everything from selling toys on our store to creating our own toy line to doing workshops to help educate the community.” Kink.com has traditionally focused on a subset of porn fans: those who are into BDSM, a category that includes erotic bondage, discipline, submission and other forms of sexual role playing. Acworth, who was unavailable to comment for this story beyond a statement, has said that the company’s revenue plunged by 50 percent from 2013 to 2016 as membership dropped. Advertisement Article continues below this ad The “free porn onslaught” sent the privately held company into the red, Boden said. “It’s hard to get people to pay for porn. You can’t really beat free for a certain percentage of people.” The company went from producing 80 movies each month in its Armory studios in 2016 to phasing out all production in 2017, Boden said. Kink’s workforce, which was more than 150 in its heyday, was trimmed to about 50 as the company “tightened our belts,” she said. Furniture and props, including a human-size hamster wheel and vintage gynecological chairs, were auctioned in March, and the company moved into a South of Market building. And instead of producing videos, Kink.com has begun licensing and distributing those from independent producers, “many of them folks we used to work with who went out on their own,” Boden said. Advertisement Article continues below this ad One is Ex Libris, who had worked for Kink.com since 2006. Now a San Francisco director who teams with independent female producers, Ex Libris spoke on condition that only her stage name be printed because of the stigma of working in porn.

Porn site Kink.com is holding another prop sale at the Armory this weekend The robotic, piston-based sex machine that can be outfitted with a dildo and other accoutrements sold, but the mattress outfitted with chains is still available. Ex Libris lamented the retreat of a company that promoted safe conditions for sex workers and proudly flew BDSM flags from the top of its headquarters. And though she said she took a financial hit after losing her job at Kink.com after the restructuring, Ex Libris said she believes in Boden’s ability to turn the company around. “I’m really glad that they’re working to make the website financially viable,” she said. The IBISWorld report said the industry’s future could depend on its ability to tap innovations like virtual reality and “smart” adult toys. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Boden said the company has teamed with Doc Johnson Enterprises of North Hollywood to sell Kink-branded sex merchandise, such as personal care products, leather handcuffs, ankle restraints, leashes and inflatable wrestling mats. The company also sells tickets to educational workshops. “Last year, we turned a profit,” Boden said. “The goal is to keep improving on that. I’m really optimistic about where we are going.” Benny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

No.  All the hair styles that we offer come with a complimentary wash and conditioner.  You only pay for hair care where wash and conditioning your hair is only what you are scheduled for I am a new client; how do I go about hair care? At Kinks Couture, our priority is the health of your hair.  On that basis, all our new clients are given a free hair-health assessment. In this session we diagnose any unhealthy issues and prescribe a treatment plan or process for your hair and scalp How do I prepare for my hair service appointment? Prepping yourself for your hair service helps in many ways to make the process faster and easier for both you and the stylist.   Here are some ways that you can prep yourself for your hair service: Ensure that all braids and twists are taken out and your hair detangled before your service. Be on time for your hair service.   If you are running behind, please give us a courtesy call so we can possibly make adjustments for the next client in line. Be sure to wear a top that can be taken off with ease, without messing up your fresh hair-do, especially if you have an event to attend after getting your hair done. If you can, be prepared budget-wise, just in case your stylist advise you of any necessary additional service you may need.   For example, you may need hydration for dry hair, or scalp boost for excessively dry and flaky scalp. Can I loc my hair if most of it is permed? Locs are best formed with naturally kinky hair due to the cylinder shape formation that occurs.  However, there are options: you can either wait for your hair to grow out a few inches where you can start your locks, or add loc extensions (see loc extension). Can I get Two Strand Twist with my perm hair? Yes you can. But it won’t stay and the formation will be flat and stringy because of the lack of elasticity in the texture. One can achieve a fuller look and longer lasting if extensions are added. For example, Kinky Twists. If I just recently permed my hair can I get braids? Chemicals break down the bonds of your hair. A freshly permed hair is in a fragile state and breakage can occur if braided. It is therefore best to wait at least three weeks before you add extensions to your freshly permed hair How do I transition into natural hair without doing The Big Chop? (Cutting off my hair all at once.) It can be difficult and frustrating when one decides to grow out their natural hair and have to deal with two textures; yet in spite of that, they keep the length for fear of not liking a shorter look, for the option of going back to a perm should they change their mind, or for the flexibility in styling with a longer length.  Holding on to your perm texture while growing out your hair is doable if you get protective styles that do not require daily grooming. This can be achieved by getting braids with your own hair or with extensions. If you want a more open style where you will be able to wear your own hair loose, you can get a textured twist-out or rod set, where both your hair textures are manipulated to create one textured look. These styles also do not require daily combing, brushing or blow drying. Most transitional styles with extensions last between two and three months. During this time you may gain a couple of inches of new growth. In between these transitional styles, your hair can be cut a few inches until your natural tresses get to a desired length where you are comfortable to do the BIG CHOP. How long does it take to grow out my perm and what products should I use while I’m growing out the perm? Each person’s hair grows at a different rate.  It may take 8 months to a year for one person to have 4-6 inches of new growth while for another it may only take 6-8 months. As your new growth sets in, it’s best to keep your hair in protective hair styles, as it makes it less likely to get damage. Use a petroleum free scalp grease on your scalp two to three times per week. Shea-butter is a great moisture agent that you can use pre-blow-drying as it serves as a heat protectant. Moisturizing leave-in conditioners are good agents for the hair. Split ends can stunt your growth, get rid of them. Why do I have split ends and how can I get rid of it? The protective layer of your hair (the cuticle) can be damaged from different causes, like over-processing hair with chemicals, excess direct heat application (Like blow dryers and curling irons.), harshly brushing hair, or ripping your hair while taking braids or twists apart, just to name a few.  Although some products can temporarily seal split ends, it is best to cut it off.  Split ends can get worse if ignored, and will gradually split up to the shaft, and sometimes all the way to the root until it completely breaks off.  Hair that lacks moisture is also susceptible to getting split ends.  Another preventative measure is to be careful when combing hair.  Comb hair gently from tip to root with wide teeth comb or fingers and deep condition hair as often as needed. What are the best Transitional Styles for my hair? The best transitional style for anyone is the style that suits them and their lifestyle.  There is a variety of styles to choose from. It is best to have a consultation with an expert hair specialist who can listen to, understand, and recommend, a style that will be healthy for your hair. A style that will best suit the shape of your face and your day-to-day life. Transitional styles Transitional Styles are hairstyles that help you during the process of growing out your natural hair. They are low maintenance and on-the-go styles that can be styled for formal occasions, corporate settings or an after-work-jam on the beach, and your hair does not have to be 100% natural in order to get one of them. Transitional Styles are also best for intervals of perms and relaxers, for long or short periods. Consult with one of our Natural Hair Specialists at Kinks Couture, who will help you to decide on the best Transitional Style that will suit your shape face, lifestyle and budget. Boost your scalp.
