Novilla It was a pleasure meeting and working with the delightful Ashlea and (then) soon to be hubby James! They were looking for a unique wedding venue, not another beach hotel nor ballroom feel, and luckily for us all they found our historic venue NOVA 535. My team really handled most all of their planning and day of details for their outdoor downtown St. Petersburg wedding here at my venue NOVA 535, and I’m delighted that everything went fabulously! James and Ashlea are such a lovely couple, so cute and in love, that it gives single people hope that Mr/Mrs Right is out there just awaiting that right lucky moment of chance and meeting. Congrats!! Pink and White Outdoor Downtown St. Petersburg Wedding When searching for a unique St. Petersburg wedding venue , Ashlea and James were adamant in having the culture and liveliness of St. Petersburg. They soon realized that NOVA 535 would be the perfect location to host their nuptials and encompassed everything they could have dreamed of in a wedding venue. Their sophisticated and traditional wedding at NOVA 535 fit the couple’s style, and the atmosphere of the venue helped enhance the atmosphere of their big day. “I was looking for something different, not your typical venue or your typical Florida wedding,” Ashlea shared. “I chose NOVA 535 because there aren’t a lot of venues like it in our area. I loved the NYC loft style building with exposed brick and wood beams.” The Brandon couple opted for an outdoor, St. Pete wedding ceremony under a wedding altar draped in flowers and flowing fabric. Guests watched the couple say their nuptials in the beautiful Florida weather. Ashlea and James’ indoor reception was intimate and full of pink uplighting that enhanced the mood of the room. Tables were decorated with lighted trees with hanging crystals and candlelight accents that added to the romanticism of the decor. What did you look for in a wedding venue: I was looking for something different, not your typical venue or your typical Florida wedding. I chose NOVA 535 because there aren’t a lot of venues like it in our area.  I loved the NYC loft style building with exposed brick and wood beams. As far as service, I felt it could not have been better. Ruby, our coordinator, was truly amazing, and the staff was perfection. They were quick, efficient, friendly and professional.
