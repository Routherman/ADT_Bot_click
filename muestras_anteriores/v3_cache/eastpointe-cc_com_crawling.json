EASTPOINTE COUNTRY CLUB WEBSITE: www.eastpointe-cc.com GENERAL MANAGER POSITION OVERVIEW The Board desires a GM who operates in a proactive and highly engaging manner, collaborating closely with the Board of Governors and leading several active committees. The GM is viewed as the “face” of Eastpointe Country Club and, in partnership with key volunteers, serves as a primary visionary to ensure that ECC consistently provides exceptionally high levels of personalized service. This lead by example GM will step into a role that offers the chance to enhance and elevate both the overall membership and staff experience, aiming to be an employer of choice within a highly competitive hospitality community. The Board wants to collaborate with a GM who manages all operational matters and acts as an active thought partner on strategic and policy issues, while also being approachable, actively listening, and ensuring transparency regarding direction and operations throughout. A key factor in the new GM success is understanding the unique nature of member owned clubs, acquired through current or previous firsthand experience. An essential part of his or her success involves putting members first and recognizing that the foundation of staff support, mentorship, clear direction, walking the talk, and being present is provided in his or her authentic, sincere, and engaging style. The ability to effectively manage expectations at a high level of dynamic leadership and reasoning is critically important. Much of this can be achieved simply by being present, approachable, accessible, and diplomatic, as well as possessing the necessary talent to inspire confidence and be trusted by all stakeholders. It is critical to pay attention to the details of maintenance, SOPs, overall member experience, staff culture, and other key areas of success. Outstanding communication skills, particularly the proven ability to listen and respond respectfully and diplomatically, are essential for success at ECC while managing club and community operations. KEY ATTRIBUTES, CHARACTERISTICS, EXPERIENCES, AND STYLE OF THE SUCCESSFUL NEW LEADER: Possess a deep understanding of active club operations, with especially strong F & B skills, as well as solid financial acumen and appreciation for modern performance management systems and technology. Being financially astute and capable of effectively overseeing a large operation, including working to enhance financial reporting areas, dashboards, and transparency in KPIs and metrics, is essential. Possessing a proven track record of selecting and developing talent for senior leadership roles within club communities, support departmental leaders in their ongoing growth and that of their teams, promoting a culture of continuous improvement towards excellence in execution and delivery. Being a natural mentor is essential. Active participation and thought leadership with the Board, Committees, and others contribute to ECC success. Ultimately, the goal is to empower members to enjoy their time and volunteer contributions, focusing on policy-making and strategic partnership rather than operational decisions. Naturally outgoing, conversational, respectful, and diplomatic, yet able to say “no” when necessary, without alienating members or staff. It is essential to maintain respectful confidence and a strong connection with both the members and the team, as well as to adopt a personal approach of listening, considering, and reflecting before responding to input.
