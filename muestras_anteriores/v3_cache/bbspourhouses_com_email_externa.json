Pink Panther It appears our trailer review for The Pink Panther was spot on... From: Justin\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2006 8:45 AM To: briggsb@bbspot.com Subject: pink panther review Hi Brian, just wanted to say that you were spot on with your trailer review for pink panther trailer, it was an absolutely atrocious movie, I got dragged along to see it with my girlfriend and it was easily the worst movie I’ve ever seen. Definitely do not bother seeing it! Keep up the good work Another reader offers some advice on Steve Martin movies... From: Ty Sent: Tuesday, February 28, 2006 2:05 PM To: briggsb@bbspot.com Subject: If you or anyone else you know is one of those people who has a goal to watch every Steve Martin movie ever made do NOT do it in chronological order. Start with the Pink Panther and work your way back to The Jerk. Skip Planes, Trains and Automobiles and come back to it last. If I knew then what I know now that's how I would have done it. Oh and about UltraVomit.. I was flipping through the channels and happened upon the trailer in progress and, I shit you not, the first thing that popped in my head was \"Oh looks like they couldn't get Uma Thurman for number 3.\" That's all for this week!
