Leave a Gift in Your Will Raise Money What’s On? Join Our Newsletter Partner With Us Blog Search Donate Search Baytreecentre.org Meet the Team Staff Carol Perry Facilities Coordinator Carol, our Facilities Coordinator, never fails to give us all a warm welcome when we arrive each morning – and always knows where the good stationery is hidden. Carol was a Care Assistant before she came to us in 2002. She loves Baytree because of the rich community made up of staff, children and parents. “I look forward to coming in every morning” she said with a smile as she spoke about the Baytree family. In her spare time Carol enjoys spending time with her friends, keeping fit and laughing. mailto: reception@baytreecentre.org.uk Sonia Pollock Afternoon Clubs Facilitator Sonia is our Afternoon Clubs Facilitator and has been working at Baytree since 2007. Prior to Baytree, she spent 13 years working in fostering and adoption at Lambeth Council. A domestic goddess, Sonia’s love of sewing means she is often found in the fashion club teaching the girls her tricks. Much to the delight of the entire team, she loves to bake and often brings in her homemade treats to share with the rest of us. A firm favourite with the girls, Sonia always has time to listen and share her words of wisdom. mailto: reception@baytreecentre.org.uk Helena Nowak Accounts Officer Helena has been Baytree’s Accounts Officer since August 2021, before this she had been volunteering within the department since 2014. Helena’s experience with Baytree dates back as she remembers the building as a derelict warehouse when it was acquired in the 1980’s. She previously worked in various roles within retail banking while volunteering repeatedly with Baytree over the years. She was born in Worthing and lived in Sussex for many years. In her spare time, Helena enjoys going for walks in the country and looking after her flourishing garden. mailto: accounts@baytreecentre.org.uk Joyce Castenada Monitoring & Evaluation Officer Joyce is our Monitoring and Evaluation Officer. She has started volunteering with us in 2016 after moving to the UK from the Philippines whilst working for another local charity near Brixton. She has been involved with all Baytree’s services and feels stongly connected with the team and service users as well as Baytree’s work. It was no surprise then that as soon as the opportunity to join Baytree as an employee opened up, she went for it. Joyce has longstanding experience in community development, education, governance and project management in her home country. She brings with her a great enthusiasm for working with children, young people and communities. Baytree is a very natural fit for her. Outside of Baytree, Joyce is a keen softball player, if by keen you mean ‘enjoys hanging out with the team and going to the pub after matches’. She is still adjusting to the UK’s unpredictable climate, so will often be found wearing thermal undergarments. mailto: joyce@baytreecentre.org.uk Rosanna Zach Head of Youth Programmes Rosanna is the Head of Youth Programmes at Baytree. Her main responsibilities include overseeing the development, management and implementation of the Youth Service strategy. She joined us in June 2015, having graduated from Roehampton University with a first-class degree in Education Policy and Sociology. Rosanna is also a JNC-qualified Youth Worker. Rosanna has lived locally, in South London since moving from Germany in 2010, and takes great satisfaction in contributing to her local community through her work at Baytree. Besides Germany and England, she has lived in Spain and spent a few years of her childhood in Botswana. mailto: rosanna@baytreecentre.org.uk 07852589394 Federica Saez Volunteer Service Manager Federica leads our Volunteer Service. She has a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Universidad de la Republica in Uruguay. She joined Baytree in March 2019. In 2022 she also worked as a Mentoring Consultant for Latin American projects at Wonder Foundation. Before joining Baytree, she worked in procurement for the hospitality sector. She has volunteered in different social projects in Kenya and Uruguay and is passionate about social mobility and community development. As a typical Uruguayan, she loves her country’s traditional tea, ‘ Mate’. mailto: federica@baytreecentre.org.uk 07940479141 Joanne Matthews Social Mobility Coach Joanne is a Social Mobility Coach in Baytree’s Women’s Service. Before joining Baytree, Joanne worked for London charity FAD, where she designed and delivered skills training and mentoring programmes, supporting 14-30-year-olds into creative careers. She has also worked for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Joanne is a qualified teacher and has taught languages, art and fashion textiles to children and adults in school, college and the community. She holds an MA in Latin American Cultural Studies, speaks French and Spanish, and has lived in Havane, Paris and Cajamarca, Peru. Joanne likes a nice cup of tea and hanging out with her daughter – their favourite places in London are the Horniman Museum and Hampstead Heath. Christina Christofi Academic Manager & ESOL tutor responsible for in-house and outreach ESOL provision Christina is the Academic Manager and the Adult ESOL and Literacy Tutor. She is a true veteran here at Baytree and has served over 20 years. When she first arrived at Baytree, Christina worked part-time teaching English, and then went on to become the ESOL coordinator. Now she is in charge of overseeing the smooth running of the Women’s Service ESOL provision, as well as teaching. Christina is a UK native but lived in Greece for 13 years, where she met her husband.

Your Privacy Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. You agree to agree to these policies by virtue of using our website in a way that leads to you providing us with personal information. State Law & Accompanying Rights Please understand that you may have additional rights originating from State laws based on where you live. These State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow compliment any privacy rights you have inherently or under Federal law. Our policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every jurisdiction in which we operate. Accordingly, you are free to use our Contact information to reach us at any time to assert any State rights. Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, our website will never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18. Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not allowed to use our website and access our services. It is not our intention to offer products or services to minors. Google Analytics Bay Tree Care Services uses Google Analytics to help analyse how users use the site. The tool uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of this website and to compile statistical reports on website activity. We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information of visitors to our site. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Other Collection of Personal Information When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Other information may be collected as well, which is rather typical of most websites. For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally known. Likewise, your duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be tracked. Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you are using to access our website has. Similarly, the type of web browser is often noted. Again, this is common data collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience. Cookies are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our website. Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the content and experience to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on. You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so choose. Please understand that refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some aspects useless to you. At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it. For instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise. Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve requested. A prime example of limited access to our website is where content may be protected by a username and password. Whether a username and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information related to or connected with you. This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private. Handling of Personal Information Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional. As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private” information is now “public,” and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place. Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so. Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.” However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way. However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base. Further, we may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion. While we are staunch privacy advocates, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our website. Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website. In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law. On the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect our own interests. For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information. Google Adsense and the DoubleClick DART Cookie Google, as a third party advertisement vendor, may use cookies to serve ads on this website. The use of DART cookies by Google enables them to serve adverts to visitors that are based on their visits to this website, including past visits, as well as other websites on the internet. To opt out of the DART cookies you may visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the following url http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html Tracking of users through the DART cookie mechanisms are subject to Google’s own privacy policies. Other Third Party ad servers or ad networks may also use cookies to track users activities on this website to measure advertisement effectiveness and other reasons that will be provided in their own privacy policies, our website has no access or control over these cookies that may be used by third party advertisers. However, you can opt out of some, though likely not all, of these cookies in one easy location at http://ww.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp Links to Third Party Websites We have included links on this website for your use and reference. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own. Comments Policy As you know, Web 2.0 is all about the conversation. But without a few simple ground rules, that conversation can turn into a shouting match that discourages others from entering into the fray. So here is Bay Tree Care Services comments policy. By posting on my blog, you agree to the following: You may comment without registering. You can log-in via Disqus, OpenID, Twitter, Facebook—or not at all. It’s up to you. You may post anonymously. I don’t recommend this, but you may do so if you wish. I may change this rule if it is abused. You may post follow-up questions. If you have a question, chances are you are not alone. Others are likely thinking similarly. Therefore, I would rather receive your comments on Bay Tree Care Services than via email. It is a better use of my time to address everyone at once rather than answer several similar emails. You may disagree with me. I welcome debate. However, I ask that if you disagree with me—or anyone else, for that matter—do so in a way that is respectful. In my opinion, there is way too much shouting in the public square to tolerate it here. Bay Tree Care Services reserves the right to delete your comments. This is my blog. I don’t have an obligation to publish your comments. The First Amendment gives you the right to express your opinions on your blog not mine. Specifically, I will delete your comments if you post something that is, in my sole opinion, (a)snarky; (b) off-topic; (c) libelous, defamatory, abusive, harassing, threatening, profane, pornographic, offensive, false, misleading, or which otherwise violates or encourages others to violate my sense of decorum and civility or any law, including intellectual property laws; or (d) “spam,” i.e., an attempt to advertise, solicit, or otherwise promote goods and services. You may, however, post a link to your site or your most recent blog post. You retain ownership of your comments. I do not own them and I expressly disclaim any and all liability that may result from them.

Identified projects should be prioritized based on future flood risk, water quality, and benefits to disadvantaged communities. As much as possible, the city should identify green stormwater infrastructure solutions to drainage issues; this could take the form of a green streets master plan. Examples Pacifica Pacifica’s Storm Drain Master Plan identifies capacity deficiencies in the storm drainage system, develops feasible alternatives to correct these deficiencies, and plans the infrastructure that will serve future development. It includes an analysis of future precipitation impacts on the storm drain system. San Mateo County The San Mateo Countywide Green Streets Master Plan identifies “how and where to build sustainable streets in San Mateo County that integrate stormwater management with local priorities, like bike and pedestrian mobility, transit improvements, climate change adaptation, and more.” It includes an analysis of stormwater runoff under future climate scenarios, which determined that the planned green street projects could offset the projected roadway runoff due to climate change for a 2-year storm. Additionally, the green streets projects were prioritized based on water quality, flood risk, water supply, climate change impacts, groundwater constraints, utility constraints, vulnerable community indicators, vehicle ownership statistics, urban canopy, and urban heat island effect. × Integrating Flood Resilience Into Capital Improvement Planning Local jurisdictions must ensure that public infrastructure (such as parks, streets, sewers, stormwater infrastructure, and shoreline infrastructure) are designed for flood resilience and incorporate nature-based solutions wherever possible. They can do this by creating capital improvement planning processes to ensure all proposed projects are evaluated for flood resilience and green infrastructure potential. Examples Burlingame Burlingame has a green infrastructure checklist used to evaluate opportunities to include green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) features in capital projects. This approach ensures that no opportunities for GSI are missed. It can be found in Appendix B of the city’s Green Infrastructure Plan . San Francisco San Francisco has a “Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco Sea Level Rise Checklist” . Using this checklist ensures that all capital projects planned in the sea level rise vulnerability zone are resilient to sea level rise. × Sea Level Rise and Groundwater Rise Overlay Districts Sea level rise and groundwater rise overlay districts map out which geographical areas will be affected by flooding under future climate conditions and apply specific development requirements or restrictions on those areas. Overlay districts can be created through a zoning code update and are a key step in ensuring that flood-resilient development conditions are implemented and enforced. OneShoreline’s Planning Policy Guidance provides template language for creating Sea Level Rise and Groundwater Rise Overlay Districts. Examples Burlingame In 2021, Burlingame updated its zoning ordinance to include regulations for the Bayfront Commercial District, including guidelines for new development to be resilient to sea level rise. Section 25.12.050 outlines public access, flood, and sea level rise performance guidelines for new developments. It adopts Burlingame’s Map of Future Conditions, including a Sea Level Rise Overlay District, which is based on the Our Coast Our Future hazard map . South San Francisco In 2022, South San Francisco (SSF) updated its zoning code to include a Flood Plain/Sea Level Rise overlay district. The overlay district includes areas that will flood under a 36-inch sea level rise scenario and a 100-year storm. It imposes new construction requirements including base flood elevations sufficient to protect against the FEMA 100-year event with 3 feet of sea level rise, nature-based stormwater infrastructure designed to function under future conditions, and a bay access buffer within 100 ft from the shoreline. × Shoreline Resilience Plan With the passage of SB 272 (Laird, 2014), Bay Area cities are required to create Shoreline Resilience Adaptation Plans (RSAPs) and have those plans approved by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) by 2034. BCDC has released draft RSAP guidelines which cities must follow when creating their shoreline plans. The guidelines will be finalized at the end of 2024. We hope to see the final guidelines reinforce an emphasis on nature-based solutions, public access, and community engagement. Examples Hayward The Hayward Regional Shoreline Adaptation Master Plan (HRSAP) was created in 2021 to establish a vision and adaptation strategies for protecting natural and built shoreline assets from sea level rise. It recommends shoreline resilience projects such as horizontal levees, gently sloping vegetated buffers that provide sea level rise protection and water quality benefits. The HRSAP was created by a joint powers authority consisting of the City, the Hayward Area Park and Recreation District (HARD), and the East Bay Regional Park District. × Favorite native plant or animal: Sky Lupine Favorite thing to do around the Bay Area: Reading a book outdoors and spending time among redwoods Superpower: Telekinesis Erin Pang Policy Manager epang@savesfbay.org Having grown up in the Bay Area, Erin is excited to join Save The Bay and work towards equitable climate policies for the region.

Richmond, CA, San Francisco Business Times The Issue The AstraZeneca site on the Richmond shoreline was once the site of sulfuric acid, pesticide, and fertilizer manufacturing. Because of this industrial pollution, it is now contaminated with high levels of toxins such as benzene, lead, arsenic, uranium, and pesticides like DDT. So far, cleanup efforts have included leaving contaminated soil on site and “capping” it by placing concrete on top. The City of Richmond has plans to build up to 4,000 housing units on top of this contaminated land. However, as sea levels rise, groundwater will also be pushed up to the surface, potentially pushing the toxins into pipes and through cracked concrete, putting the health of residents and surrounding communities at risk. The Solution For decades, frontline community members in Richmond have been raising awareness about the health and environmental threats posed by groundwater and sea level rise displacing toxic contaminants on industrial sites. Because of a long history of racist policies, the communities surrounding these sites are largely low-income communities of color. They are advocating for full cleanup of the AstraZeneca site before any housing is built on it, rather than simply capping contamination in place. This would involve removing all contamination from the site and taking it to a safer storage or treatment site. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which oversees cleanup of the site, should require AstraZeneca to conduct a full cleanup. Additionally, groundwater and sea level rise should be considered in all toxic site cleanup efforts.

The highway’s redesign, if done correctly, offers an opportunity to build climate-resilient infrastructure and restore 20,000 acres of wetlands. Highway 37 on a dry day, Karl Nielsen The Issue Highway 37 sits on a levee in San Pablo Bay in the north Bay Area.  In 2017, the highway was shut down for a month due to flooding caused by a combination of King Tides and winter storms. During the atmospheric rivers in January 2023, the highway was again closed for a weekend when it flooded due to Novato Creek overflowing. These closures will likely happen again and again as sea levels rise if no action is taken. This would disrupt 40,000 daily car trips which people depend on to get them to jobs in Marin, Sonoma, Napa and Solano Counties. Additionally, the levee that the highway sits on currently blocks natural tide flow from San Pablo Bay to wetlands on the north side of the highway. The Solution The redesign of Highway 37 is currently in the early planning stages. One of the proposed designs is to build the highway on an elevated causeway. This would put the highway above the reach of rising sea levels while also letting water ebb and flow with natural tidal action between San Pablo Bay and the wetlands beyond the highway. Once these 20,000 acres of wetlands are reconnected with the natural flow of tides, they can be restored to their full function, providing habitat, carbon sequestration, and flood resilience benefits.

State Coastal Conservancy) × San Mateo County Of all the counties in California, San Mateo County is the most vulnerable to sea level rise. San Mateo, January 2, 2023, Bruce Washburn The Issues Sea Level Rise Sea levels could rise by up to 3.3 feet in San Mateo County by 2070 and 6 feet by 2100 according to the county’s Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment . While the whole Bay Area will experience rising seas, San Mateo County is particularly vulnerable, with over 30,000 homes, dozens of schools and hospitals, and over 7,000 acres of wetlands at risk of flooding by 2070. Historically underinvested communities will be the most at risk when flooding occurs because historic inequities placed affordable housing in higher flood risk areas and because they are more vulnerable to economic damages incurred. Inland Flooding Not all flooding happens at the coast. As storms and groundwater rise become more extreme, Bay Area communities will continue to be impacted by flooded streets and homes due to outdated stormwater infrastructure. Additionally, urban areas are primarily covered in concrete, asphalt, and other surfaces that don’t allow water to seep through. This means that during storms, rainwater runs off these surfaces picking up pollutants (like motor oil, chemicals, and trash) on its way to creeks and the Bay. The Solutions Sea Level Rise Preparing the county for sea level rise will require a coordinated effort among cities to plan and implement solutions such as wetland restoration, horizontal levees, and sea walls. San Mateo County has taken steps in this direction with the creation of OneShoreline , a government agency that works across jurisdictional boundaries to plan and implement sea level rise resilience measures in the county. The County also conducted a countywide Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment to identify areas that will be impacted by flooding and erosion and provide solutions. This coordinated effort should be replicated across the Bay Area. Cooperation between cities and counties throughout the Bay Area is necessary to ensure that shoreline protection in one area doesn’t result in greater flooding in others. This could happen, for example, when a sea wall in one city deflects storm surges towards an adjacent city without flood protections. There should also be coordination at the state and federal level to provide funding to low-income cities that may not otherwise have resources for sea level rise planning. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) is currently creating guidelines to shape local sea level rise plans. Inland Flooding Cities must invest in updated stormwater infrastructure to reduce flooding and capture and clean stormwater before it reaches our waterways. In particular, green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) uses natural systems like vegetation, soil, and permeable surfaces to capture stormwater and filter out pollutants. Examples include rain gardens, bioswales, and tree wells. When cities upgrade streets, parks, and other infrastructure, they could be incorporating GSI at the same time, making these new investments more flood resilient.  San Mateo County is supporting this kind of integrated planning with their Sustainable Streets Master Plan .

Our apprentices get a chance to engage with all areas of the business, from testing IT solutions to customer relations. Our latest apprentice Kayleigh has written about her time with us so far. My name is Kayleigh Bennett and I am the apprentice business administrator here at Baytree Solutions, I study level 3 business administration in college within this role. This time last year I was really struggling to find what I wanted to do as a career. My confidence was very low and I had no self-esteem, this lead me to stay at home and shy away from the working life as I believed I wouldn’t be good enough in any job role. Everything changed for me in January 2021 when I was given an amazing opportunity to become an apprentice at Baytree. Leading up to the new job I was feeling very nervous and started to doubt myself worrying about how I would manage this new role as I was putting a lot of pressure on myself. When I started the new job I spent the first couple of weeks completing training with support from my manager, over these few weeks I felt this pressure I was putting on myself disappear, since then I have taken on every task I have been given with newfound confidence. I really enjoy getting involved in tasks that I am usually unfamiliar with, I take this as an opportunity to develop my skills and knowledge in new areas to build up my confidence. I have learned so much during my time working at Baytree Solutions. Having had no previous experience working in IT or social housing, I wasn’t aware of how housing associations operated or how IT solutions can help. During my time with Baytree, I have developed a good understanding of the CRM system and how much it can help housing associations. I really enjoy testing our CRM system after it has been designed and built. I also enjoy how I am constantly learning something new every day within our organisation and the social housing sector. When I have completed my tasks I feel proud of what I have completed and proud to present it to my manager. To be able to contribute to the business with the work I have completed throughout my time at Baytree and the appreciation I am shown for this always spurs me on to work harder on the next task so that I am constantly gaining more confidence and believing in myself. I can’t thank the team at Baytree enough for all the support they have provided me with during my time here, they are always encouraging and supporting me along the way to try new tasks and achieve higher goals. This then pushes me to work to the best of my ability so that I am reaching the goals I set out for myself and feeling proud of my achievements. If you sat me down this time last year and told me what I would be doing in a years’ time, I would never have believed you. I’m grateful to Baytree Solutions for giving me this opportunity as this has allowed me to see just how capable I am of achieving so much during my time here, which I could never have pictured myself doing a year ago. I am feeling proud of myself for how far I’ve come in the past year, I look forward to continuing my progress and growth and seeing what the future holds for me!
