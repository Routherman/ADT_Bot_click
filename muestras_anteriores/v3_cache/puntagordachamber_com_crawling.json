Barbara Dolleschal It was on my to-do list to become a member of this organization for a long time. Finally, this summer I joined. I knew - joining a networking organization also means time commitment (because it's just like a gym, if you don't use your membership, it doesn't work). So, this summer it was about time to do it. The experience was just WOW! I mean, it's not my first chamber membership, I've been in 3 others (still kept membership for one of them) but yes - wow - this is a very new experience. I thought Punta Gorda is a tiny town, very calm etc... but I was so wrong. The activities are great, so many events and opportunities to connect with other people and so many opportunities to market our business. And the president is the most active I've ever seen and really caring. He is not just doing his job, I believe there is true passion behind this and this helps a lot to put this organization into this what it is right now. A buzzing swarm of great people, open to connect, talk, network. It's a really great experience and I just recently said to another new member, I should have joined much earlier. Elaine Martin The Punta Gorda Chamber is a must have asset for the business community. It is an epicenter for business information with endless networking opportunities to promote your business throughout the community. The friendships are endless and the community pride enormous.
