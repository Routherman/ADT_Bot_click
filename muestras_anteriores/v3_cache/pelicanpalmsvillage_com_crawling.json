One of the larger mobile home parks in St. Petersburg has a new owner. But unlike other area mobile home communities that have been acquired for redevelopment projects, Legacy Communities has no plans redevelop the property it just acquired, Conner’s Mobile Home Park at 2701 34 th St. N. “We’re not redevelopers,” Andrew Fells, chief operating officer at Legacy Communities, told the St. Pete Catalyst . “We plan to continue to operate it as a manufactured housing community. It’s what we’ve been doing for 20-plus years.” Conner’s Mobile Home Park, an age-restricted 55+ community with about 286 mobile home sites, sold Feb. 14 for $16.8 million, a deed filed with Pinellas County shows. The buyer, Legacy PIII Pelican LLC, took out a $13.4 million mortgage on the property that same day with with Walker & Dunlop, a Bethesda, Maryland-based commercial real estate finance firm. Legacy PIII Pelican LLC is a joint venture between Legacy Communities and PGIM Real Estate, a person familiar with the deal said. PGIM Real Estate is the real estate investment manager for Prudential Financials’ PGIM asset management business. The address listed on Legacy PIII Pelican’s deed and mortgage documents is that of PGIM Real Estate. Legacy Communities, headquartered in Sebring, Florida, owns and operates 21 mobile home communities and RV resorts around the United States. About half of them are in Florida. The Conner’s property is Legacy Communities’ first acquisition in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. Legacy’s purchasing decisions mostly focus on specific properties instead of market presence, Fells said. “It’s not necessarily a specific market we look for. It’s a community we see that we like and that we are comfortable operating for the foreseeable future.” Legacy generally updates the common areas and amenities at the properties it acquires, and it plans to do so at the Conner’s property, although Fells didn’t want to be specific about what was in store. He planned to meet with residents Wednesday to introduce the company to them. Legacy also is changing the name of the property to Pelican Palms Village. A handful of other mobile home parks in St. Petersburg also have sold recently, and in at least some of the cases the new owner plans to redevelop the property. Most recently, Belleaire Development Group said it would build a new multi-family residential developmen t at the site of the former Lamplight Village mobile home park at 8700 4 th St. N. Nationally, mobile homes communities have become an increasingly popular tool for real estate managers to earn returns, according to a recent report in Pensions&Investments . After converting mobile home parks to institutional ownership, they can make improvements, increase income by raising rents and create portfolios that can be sold or spun off into real estate investment trusts, the report said. Those rent hikes have struck a nerve with many residents, who are living in the mobile home parks in part because they offer affordable housing. PGIM Real Estate, which has been investing in the sector for a couple of years in partnerships with operators, generally maintains below-market rates, Lee Menifee, managing director and head of Americas investment research at the firm, told Pensions&Investments . “We are mindful that manufactured housing communities are a source of affordable housing and it is our intent to maintain them as affordable,” Menifee said.

Interestingly, Palm Lake CEO, Manuel Lang, was Palm Lake’s National Bank account manager before joining the group in 2012. The developments include: Its 320-home Pelican Waters project – due to start civil work in early 2021 – will feature the Group’s first hotel – adjacent to the 140ha Greg Norman-designed golf course they purchased alongside the 20ha development site in December 2018. Intriguingly, plans are also being made for a “very high-end”, 60-home separately gated enclave within the larger resort that Palm Lake anticipates will attract ‘snowbirds’ – people who would use their home in the community for the six warmer months of the year, similar to how wealthy Americans migrate to Hawaii, Mexico and the Caribbean. A 200-home community on a greenfield site at Paynesville, in Gippsland, Victoria, close to the town centre which is expected to begin construction at the end of 2021. A greenfield development with an 18-hole golf course at Old Bar Beach, near Taree, in NSW. A community at Forster Lakes (pictured above), which is already underway with the first stage of 44 homes and Country Club expected to be completed around May 2021. Founded 43 years ago in Victoria by Walter Elliott, Palm Lake now has 25 communities across QLD, NSW and Victoria with 11,000 residents and 1,300 staff.
