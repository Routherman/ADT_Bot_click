We would like to welcome you. OUR STORY Hi, we’re Jamie and Suzan, partners in adventure for over 17 years and married for 11. Our story wouldn’t be complete without Due, our lovable chocolate lab who’s always by our side. For years, we dreamed of creating a place where travelers could feel as inspired and welcomed as we do when exploring the world. During a trip through South America four years ago, Colombia captured our hearts with its stunning nature, rich culture, and, above all, its amazing people.\n\nIn April 2022, we took the leap and left the Netherlands to start a new chapter in Colombia, not knowing exactly where it would lead. Our journey brought us to Jardín by chance, and no other place could compare. The vibrant community, beautiful landscapes, and the warm spirit of Jardín made us feel instantly at home. By January 2023, we began turning our vision into reality on a coffee plantation, creating Glamping Jardin—a place where guests could experience the unique charm of Jardín, just as we first did.\n\nEvery detail at Glamping Jardin reflects our commitment to comfort, sustainability, and genuine experiences. We take pride in supporting the local community and preserving the natural beauty that surrounds us. This isn’t just our home; it’s a place where we hope you’ll feel part of the family, immersed in the beauty and culture of Jardín. We can’t wait to welcome you and share our little corner of paradise. OUR TEAM With our small team, we will make your stay as perfect as possible!\nDon't hesitate to ask us anything! We are always willing to help you! Jamie van Oost Owner The silent force of Glamping Jardín. Always welcoming and with an eye for detail. With his  years of background as a chef, he's the best at making our guests feel at home. Suzan van Oost Owner Enthusiastic, present, and always busy. In charge of communication, bookings, and reception, she is always there for everyone and you can contact her with any question. Don Jose ¨Conejo¨ Caretaker The loving caretaker of our banana and coffee plants. Armed with a lifetime of knowledge, he makes sure every bag of coffee is perfect. When he´s not out with the plants or processing coffee beans, you can find him feeding Due under the table. Due Entertainment Our best friend and always friendly and happy. Likes to chill, to play with a ball, and cuddle. And nothing makes him happier than walking in nature and swimming in rivers! Do you want to stay with us? Check out our accomodations. View Room Options! SUSTAINABILITY For us, sustainability will always be more than simply receiving the designation of \"eco\" hotel or hostel—that´s the easy part. \nWe are committed to building our project with genuine care for the environment and people around us. We work with local architects, designers, and builders to ensure we are directly supporting the people who live in this community. We prioritize using local materials and sustainable products, and we are making every effort to minimize our impact on nature while building. When we complete construction on any of our projects, we plant native trees and vegetation to restore the environment around the area we disturbed. To minimize our reliance on treated drinking water, the showers on our property use water from the natural well. GET IN TOUCH Give Us a Call Call us in between 9:00 & 18:00 (GMT-5). If we don't answer we're probably busy making our guests feel at home. Please send us a WhatsApp! WhatsApp The easiest way to contact us! We will always respond within 12hr.

For more information about who we are and what we do, you can explore our About Us page . Homes & Gardens online & magazine Sarah Spiteri Social Links Navigation Global Brand Director I am Editorial Director of Future's Homes network, and I am very proud to run the brilliant media brands Homes & Gardens (including its sister print magazines Country Homes and Period Living) and Livingetc. I've been writing and editing interiors, design, decorating and lifestyle content for my whole career and I am utterly passionate about it. It spills into my home life, too, as I renovate projects with my husband George. Style-wise I am most comfortable in pared-back spaces, where a curated selection of pieces have room to breathe. I love raw linen, textured plaster, weathered wood and luscious marble. I then also try to mix in an imaginative or surprising touch - like a bespoke cornice (we recently did a fun bobbin design), an accent chair with a frill or a stand-out pattern in a small entryway. It’s all about the detail. Jennifer Ebert Social Links Navigation Editor, Digital I am the Editor (Digital) of Homes & Gardens online. Before starting this position, I had completed various interior design courses at KLC Design School, as well as working across Ideal Home, LivingEtc, 25 Beautiful Homes and Country Homes & Interiors as an interiors writer. When the opportunity to work on such a prestigious, influential brand came up, I just couldn't pass up on the offer. I have long admired Homes & Gardens, and to me, this brand epitomizes luxury and beauty at its finest. My perfect space would be a grand Georgian property – it is an architectural style that I admire greatly – though my style varies wildly from anywhere between classic design to modern rustic simplicity. If I could pick one interior designer to remodel my home, it would be Jake Arnold. His California-cool interior choices are unparalleled. Lucy Searle Social Links Navigation Content Director I have written about interiors, property and gardens since 1990, working my way around the interiors departments of women's magazines before switching to interiors-only titles in the mid-nineties. I was Associate Editor on Ideal Home, and Launch Editor of 4Homes magazine, before moving into digital in 2007, launching Channel 4's flagship website, Channel4.com/4homes. In 2018, I took on the role of Global Editor in Chief for Realhomes.com, taking the site from a small magazine add-on to a global success. I was asked to repeat that success at Homes & Gardens, where I also took on the editorship of the magazine. I am now Content Director of the brand. I am a serial renovator and also own rental properties, so bring first-hand knowledge to the subjects I oversee. I have many design heroes, but if forced to pick two, they would be Jake Arnold and Irene Gunter – both create beautiful homes that are inviting and practical. Lindsey Davis Social Links Navigation Content Director, Ecommerce I made my first foray into writing about homes 10 years ago when I joined the Homebuilding & Renovating team as web editor. In 2015 I was asked to also look after Real Homes and Period Living websites, too, before moving into a role specialising in product content. In 2020 we took on Ideal Home, Livingetc and Homes & Gardens and I was later made Content Director for shopping content across the brands. When I bought my first house seven years ago my love of interiors suddenly became a lot more hands on. It is an ongoing project but I have put our advice to good use, tiling a bathroom wall and converting my attic. Preferring to be outside, my garden probably gets the most attention and is a mix of Mediterranean planting and English cottage borders. Zara Stacey Social Links Navigation Managing Editor I joined Homes & Gardens in February 2022 as a Content Editor. After studying English Literature at University, I have worked as an Ecommerce Website Editor, Content Writer and Buying Intern at multiple independent businesses within the luxury retail and lifestyle sectors. My role at Homes & Gardens unites my love, experience and passion for the world of design and desire to create inspiring written content. In terms of my own personal style, I'm a huge lover of color and pattern, I especially love a pastel color scheme. I also enjoy nothing more than discovering new trends, brands and products, whether that be in fashion, interior design or lifestyle – my wish list of new things to buy is never-ending. Jo Bailey Social Links Navigation Editor, Print I am Editor of Homes & Gardens magazine. Before joining Future Plc, I worked as an interior stylist and set designer, specializing in editorial and commercial photo shoots as well as installations, exhibitions and events. My background within this field means I have a particular interest in the creative ways to make a house a home, as well as hunting down the best places to source beautiful things. Jennifer Spaeth Social Links Navigation Group Chief Sub Editor I'm a homes writer and editor with more than 20 years' experience in publishing. I have worked across many titles, including Ideal Home and, of course, Homes & Gardens. My day job is as Chief Group Sub Editor across the homes and interiors titles in the group. This has given me broad experience in interiors advice on just about every subject. I'm obsessed with interiors and delighted to be part of the Homes & Gardens team. Hebe Hatton Social Links Navigation Head of Interiors I am the Head of Interiors at Homes & Gardens; I have a background in lifestyle and interior journalism and a passion for renovating small spaces. You'll usually find me attempting DIY, whether it's spray painting my whole kitchen, don't try that at home, or ever-changing the wallpaper in my entryway. Homes & Gardens has been such a huge inspiration and has influenced my style since I moved into my first rental and finally had a small amount of control over the decor and now I love being able to help others make decisions when decorating their own homes. Rachel Bull Social Links Navigation Head of Gardens I am Head of Gardens at Homes & Gardens. My editorial career began 15 years ago on Country Living magazine, sparking a love of container gardening and wild planting. After more than a decade writing for and editing a wide range of consumer, business and special interest titles, I became editor of floral art magazine The Flower Arranger. I then trained and worked as a floral designer and stylist in London for six years, creating floral installations at iconic venues and styling for some amazing interiors brands. My love of gardening has endured throughout, and I now grow an abundance of vegetables and cut flowers on our rambling Yorkshire plot, whilst also renovating our Edwardian home. I am particularly interested in sustainable gardening methods and growing flowers and herbs for wellbeing. Katrina Harper-Lewis Social Links Navigation Head of Living I am Head of Living at Homes & Gardens, covering hosting and entertaining, seasonal styling ideas, sleep and wellbeing, along with a highly experienced team of writers and reviewers. With more than 15 years' experience in lifestyle content, I was previously an editor at luxury lifestyle platform, Muddy Stilettos , have been a features writer at Sainsbury's magazine and have also written for a wealth of other food and lifestyle titles including Ideal Home , Waitrose Food , John Lewis' Edition and The Home Page . I am passionate about heritage style and live in a 100-year old cottage in rural Hertfordshire, where I enjoys finding creative ways to live and host stylishly. Punteha van Terheyden Social Links Navigation Head of Solved I was the editor of Real Homes before joining Homes and Gardens as Head of Solved. Before joining the homes vertical, I spent 16 years writing and editing lifestyle and consumer pieces for the national press, working across print and digital on both newspapers and magazines.

Meet the team Leadership team Sarah Spiteri Social Links Navigation Global Brand Director I am Editorial Director of Future's Homes network, and I am very proud to run the brilliant media brands Homes & Gardens (including its sister print magazines Country Homes and Period Living) and Livingetc. I've been writing and editing interiors, design, decorating and lifestyle content for my whole career and I am utterly passionate about it. It spills into my home life, too, as I renovate projects with my husband George. Style-wise I am most comfortable in pared-back spaces, where a curated selection of pieces have room to breathe. I love raw linen, textured plaster, weathered wood and luscious marble. I then also try to mix in an imaginative or surprising touch - like a bespoke cornice (we recently did a fun bobbin design), an accent chair with a frill or a stand-out pattern in a small entryway. It’s all about the detail. Jennifer Ebert Social Links Navigation Editor, Digital I am the Editor (Digital) of Homes & Gardens online. Before starting this position, I had completed various interior design courses at KLC Design School, as well as working across Ideal Home, LivingEtc, 25 Beautiful Homes and Country Homes & Interiors as an interiors writer. When the opportunity to work on such a prestigious, influential brand came up, I just couldn't pass up on the offer. I have long admired Homes & Gardens, and to me, this brand epitomizes luxury and beauty at its finest. My perfect space would be a grand Georgian property – it is an architectural style that I admire greatly – though my style varies wildly from anywhere between classic design to modern rustic simplicity. If I could pick one interior designer to remodel my home, it would be Jake Arnold. His California-cool interior choices are unparalleled. Lucy Searle Social Links Navigation Content Director I have written about interiors, property and gardens since 1990, working my way around the interiors departments of women's magazines before switching to interiors-only titles in the mid-nineties. I was Associate Editor on Ideal Home, and Launch Editor of 4Homes magazine, before moving into digital in 2007, launching Channel 4's flagship website, Channel4.com/4homes. In 2018, I took on the role of Global Editor in Chief for Realhomes.com, taking the site from a small magazine add-on to a global success. I was asked to repeat that success at Homes & Gardens, where I also took on the editorship of the magazine. I am now Content Director of the brand. I am a serial renovator and also own rental properties, so bring first-hand knowledge to the subjects I oversee. I have many design heroes, but if forced to pick two, they would be Jake Arnold and Irene Gunter – both create beautiful homes that are inviting and practical. Lindsey Davis Social Links Navigation Ecommerce Editor in Chief I made my first foray into writing about homes 10 years ago when I joined the Homebuilding & Renovating team as web editor. In 2015 I was asked to also look after Real Homes' predecessor Realhomesmagazine.co.uk and the Period Living website which has now found a new home on Homesandgardens.com. In 2020 I began overseeing product content for them all. When I bought my first house seven years ago my love of interiors suddenly became a lot more hands on. It is an ongoing project but I have put our advice to good use, tiling a bathroom wall and converting my attic. Zara Stacey Social Links Navigation Managing Editor I joined Homes & Gardens in February 2022 as a Content Editor. After studying English Literature at University, I have worked as an Ecommerce Website Editor, Content Writer and Buying Intern at multiple independent businesses within the luxury retail and lifestyle sectors. My role at Homes & Gardens unites my love, experience and passion for the world of design and desire to create inspiring written content. In terms of my own personal style, I'm a huge lover of color and pattern, I especially love a pastel color scheme. I also enjoy nothing more than discovering new trends, brands and products, whether that be in fashion, interior design or lifestyle – my wish list of new things to buy is never-ending. Jo Bailey Social Links Navigation Editor, Print I am Editor of Homes & Gardens magazine. Before joining Future Plc, I worked as an interior stylist and set designer, specializing in editorial and commercial photo shoots as well as installations, exhibitions and events. My background within this field means I have a particular interest in the creative ways to make a house a home, as well as hunting down the best places to source beautiful things. Francesca York Social Links Navigation Social Content Director Francesca is the Social Content Director for Homes & Gardens, Livingetc, Ideal Home and ROOMS, overseeing social content execution and strategy across all four brands. She is a social media expert with over 15 years' experience and a strong background in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle. Throughout her career Francesca has worked for many well-known brands including Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, NET-A-PORTER, Hypebeast and, ABASK. Jennifer Spaeth Social Links Navigation Group Chief Sub Editor I'm a homes writer and editor with more than 20 years' experience in publishing. I have worked across many titles, including Ideal Home and, of course, Homes & Gardens. My day job is as Chief Group Sub Editor across the homes and interiors titles in the group. This has given me broad experience in interiors advice on just about every subject. I'm obsessed with interiors and delighted to be part of the Homes & Gardens team. Interiors team Hebe Hatton Social Links Navigation Head of Interiors I am the Head of Interiors at Homes & Gardens; I have a background in lifestyle and interior journalism and a passion for renovating small spaces. You'll usually find me attempting DIY, whether it's spray painting my whole kitchen, don't try that at home, or ever-changing the wallpaper in my entryway. Homes & Gardens has been such a huge inspiration and has influenced my style since I moved into my first rental and finally had a small amount of control over the decor and now I love being able to help others make decisions when decorating their own homes. Charlotte Olby Style & Trends Editor I am Style & Trends Editor at Homes and Gardens and have been with the team since Christmas 2023. Following a 5 year career in Fashion, and most recently working as interior editor for British heritage department store Liberty, my role at H&G fuses my love of style with my passion for interior design. I am currently undergoing my second home renovation in Surrey with my husband and our dog Indie - you can follow our journey over on @olbyhome Eleanor Richardson Interior Design News Writer I am the Interior Design News Editor at Homes and Gardens, covering mainly US-based designers and trending news stories. My love for interiors began when I interned in an interior design studio, working on commercial and private spaces. My passion grew when working in production, where I sourced beautiful locations for photoshoots and campaigns. Outside work, I enjoy collecting antique and Mid-century furniture and quirky homewares for my new flat. Molly Malsom Kitchens & Bathrooms Editor I am a Kitchens & Bathrooms Editor for Homes & Gardens, which I joined at the beginning of 2024. Before joining the team, I worked at Homes & Antiques magazine and The English Home magazine, writing about everything from timeless room designs to sourcing the best vintage and pre-loved homeware, with an emphasis on kitchens and bathrooms. In my own home, I favor neutral, calming color palettes and love to decorate with art and decor pieces collected on my travels. Gardens team Rachel Bull Social Links Navigation Head of Gardens I am Head of Gardens at Homes & Gardens. My editorial career began 15 years ago on Country Living magazine, sparking a love of container gardening and wild planting. After more than a decade writing for and editing a wide range of consumer, business and special interest titles, I became editor of floral art magazine The Flower Arranger. I then trained and worked as a floral designer and stylist in London for six years, creating floral installations at iconic venues and styling for some amazing interiors brands. My love of gardening has endured throughout, and I now grow an abundance of vegetables and cut flowers on our rambling Yorkshire plot, whilst also renovating our Edwardian home. I am particularly interested in sustainable gardening methods and growing flowers and herbs for wellbeing. Drew Swainston Social Links Navigation Content Editor I started working as a journalist back in 2008 after gaining my National Council for the Training of Journalists qualifications. I wrote news and features for online news agencies and content providers, as well as spending time as Assistant Editor for trade newspapers and magazines. Gardening piqued my interest, however,  and I studied for a Level 3 Horticulture qualification. This opened up the chance to work as a professional gardener for several years. Since then I've worked at the world famous arts and crafts garden Hidcote Manor Garden in the UK, and also spent several years at Hanbury Hall gardens in the UK. During my gardening career I also specialized as a kitchen gardener for the likes of Soho Farmhouse, and also produced year-round vegetables, microgreens, fruit and herbs for chefs at a prestigious restaurant. Throughout my time working outdoors I continued to write and also ran a blog called Perennial Nerd for many years, talking about my life working in gardens. My passion for gardening and a love for inspiring others to grow led me to write how-to growing guides and professional tips for clients and websites in the horticultural sector, and I'm now bringing that same expertise and passion to Homes & Gardens."
