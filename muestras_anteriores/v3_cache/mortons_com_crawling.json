We prioritize hiring those who can commit to our entire guest season from May through September, with special emphasis on the high-season of June, July & August . Also, because our small seasonal operation is so powerfully supported with a nimble, cross-trained crew (where staff are versatile across two or more roles), we prioritize hiring those who would enjoy and welcome serving in multiple spheres (e.g. Cafe & Gate, or Lifeguardian & Gate). This also keeps the work more fun and interesting for everyone while connecting us better as an entire team– a true win-win! That said, some specialty and/or assistant management-level positions are possible outside of these aforementioned parameters (e.g. within a single sphere, with limited availability, etc.) so please do still reach out if interested with questions.

[ return to top ] FACILITIES TECHNICIAN Part-time · $25 – $30 DOE / hour + perks Position Summary The Facilities Technician works as part of our small and nimble Facilities, Grounds & Maintenance team who maintains, cleans, resets, repairs and improves all of our buildings, facilities, grounds and landscaping here at the Springs. The time required for this role could shift slightly with seasonal needs, but generally this position is part-time for somewhere between 14-16 hours/week scheduled over 2, or potentially 3, days/week. The available days must include Mondays and Fridays, as well as occasional shifts on Tuesdays whenever a Monday falls on one of these federal holidays: Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, and Labor Day. Generally, our facilities techs have significant experience working with their hands in some capacity–be it working professionally in a trade, maintaining a building, property or workshop, or teaching themselves how to build and fix things for fun. These are those natural D.I.Y. people with an obvious aptitude for building, carpentry, plumbing, and electrical, even if their skills are still growing in these fields. Eager to ply their trade and/or gain new skills and experience, they’re deeply motivated to join a team working to restore a historic property. These are folks who love seeing the results of their efforts every day, making places more clean, functional, safe, and beautiful for the community. For this position, we’re looking for someone who not only enjoys working on necessary repairs and creative improvements, but also thrives in the simple “chop wood, carry water” work of cleaning and maintaining weekly basics on our grounds and facilities. They enjoy the quality and creative details of their craft but also feel at home tackling problems expediently and on a budget. Ideally this person would also enjoy working alongside and helping to guide occasional volunteer work crews (both skilled and unskilled) with a helpful, can-do attitude.​ For this position you must be a self-starter who enjoys working solo and together with a commitment to healthy, mature communication. If it’s your dream to co-create and maintain legacy built environments that interact with and uplift ecology and community alike, this might be the place for you. Though non-essential, some other plusses could include interest in such things as: green building, creative repurposing; low-to-net zero energy environments/alternative energy; building relationships with local suppliers/specialized professionals; permaculture & farming; forest management. Our ideal Facilities Technician is someone interested in a future year-round position, and also potential residency onsite. For example, if after an initial 6 month trial period a continuing relationship is mutually warranted, the Facilities Tech would likely be invited into a year-round position. Separately, this could include or not include either seasonal residential immersion (April-November only), or a year-round residential fellowship. Year-round residents here (either living onsite or offsite) play a role in long-term planning, projects, community building, ecological restoration, and co-evolving our broader vision and mission. Primary Responsibilities Helping to track, inspect, coordinate and implement all aspects of cleaning, maintaining, repairing and improving facilities including buildings, bathrooms, picnic areas, tools & equipment. Helping to organize and maintain all on-site shops, sheds, tools, materials and supplies Helping to implement quality improvements and upgrades to the grounds and facilities Working within the facilities budget, as directed by the Facilities Manager & Co-director Assisting with functionality and safety needs for special events, programs or public rentals Participating in appropriate meetings with stewards, staff and volunteers and utilizing/ being willing to learn self-management practices and techniques Required Qualifications Two (2) or more years of experience working in one of the following: building/construction and/or carpentry, plumbing, electrical, or other similar applied trade Familiarity with/capacity to adhere to the rules & regulations of county health, fire, building & planning departments Organized, confident and self-motivated to work independently and at times collectively; able to self-manage most projects and routines while asking for help when needed. Experience or enthusiasm to work with subcontractors and helping coordinate/guide volunteers Mature communication and interpersonal skills (we use & practice nonviolent communication/NVC) Passion for quality craftsmanship and work, with a balance of creative reuse/repurposing Interest in green building, environmental protection, low-to-net zero energy and low-to-no toxin environments Adequate record-keeping skills; email & computer literacy (Google Docs, Sheets, Calendar) Enthusiasm for our mission to create wellbeing and build just and sustainable communities Reliable availability April – October on at least Mondays, Fridays as well as some Tuesdays Ability to lift 50+ pounds Valid CA Driver’s License, operating motor vehicle, active car insurance, and proven track record of operating a vehicle safely – part of this job may be to run pick-ups to various local producers (as we’re so small we often can’t get deliveries). We will reimburse for mileage at the federal rate any time you use your own vehicle for work purposes. Reciprocity Compensation is DOE, ranging $25-$30, plus great perks, such as a complimentary Season Pass for a friend or family, complimentary shift meals/drinks when working, as well as year-round private hot spring soaking. [ return to top ] WELLNESS / BODYWORK PRACTITIONER We are seeking experienced contract practitioners to facilitate onsite wellness, movement and bodywork offerings for our guests coming to Morton’s during our public guest season from May through September. We’re interested in practitioners deeply versed and experienced in various bodywork modalities such as Swedish, Shiatsu, Esalen, and/or Thai massage, as well as modalities such as Acupuncture, Reiki, and Biodynamic Craniosacral therapies. We’re also seeking facilitators for movement arts offerings, be it to lead guests in yoga, partner or AcroYoga, various forms of ecstatic dance such as Soul Motion or 5 Rhythms, or nature-based mindfulness/meditation, sound healing, or somatic experiencing offerings. Contracts are part-time with flexible hours requiring at least one (1) weekend day (Sat-Sun) and at least one (1) weekday (Tues-Fri) day per week. For the right person, this position could expand into more of a full-time role through fall. Our ideal Wellness/Bodywork contractor candidate is also someone who’s interested in the possibility of returning to work here seasonally, year after year, to grow with the organization and take on more of a wellness leadership role with increased responsibility, seniority and creative freedom to help us build out an accessible and nature-based wellness program here at the Springs. Position Summary Coming soon… Primary Responsibilities Coming soon… Required Qualifications Coming soon… Reciprocity DOE , plus great perks* and tips. There may be optional enrichment opportunities in the form of workshops and/or trainings that are open for participation as well. FARM & GARDEN MANAGER/MENTOR We’re seeking an experienced farming and gardening mentor/lead to manage our 1/4 acre, low-to-no-till organic farm and garden and anchor our small but mighty community team in our 2025 growing season. Ideally this position would ASAP, and, after a successful first growing year together, this position would ideally become ongoing and/or be able to expand in hours, if and as mutually desired. Our farm & garden was established in 2018 and, so far, we’ve been growing annuals, some perennials, flowers, a beginning insectary, as well as some cover crops for soil-building over about ⅔’s of its fenced area–meaning there’s room to grow. Our property is blessed with plentiful water, a few weekly Steward workers, occasional volunteers, and a gorgeous truly one-of-a-kind location. Position Summary Our ideal candidate is a community-minded person with significant skills & experience in regenerative, organic and/or biodynamic farming practices. This position would be for 2 or 3 mornings a week, with additional self-scheduled time if and as needed, totaling roughly 8-12 hours/wk on average, depending on the season. The pay/reciprocity for this position is negotiable and depends on experience/needs. It also comes with all-you-can-grow-and-eat garden produce as well as access/enjoyment of onsite community amenities and Springs. Our garden feeds our small onsite steward community and, during the summer, it also supplies our hyper-local organic farm-to-table counter service Cafe 108° (and we’d love to see this grow). So you’d be part of coordinating and supplying some seasonal produce to that cafe for the summer months (roughly May-Sept). For this position you must be a self-starter with strong communication, consistent organizational integrity, and emotional maturity. Another important attribute is being an advocate of local, organic, farm-to-table foods, regenerative farming, the slow food movement/food sovereignty, and building relationships with local food makers. Other plusses include being personally motivated to seek out new ways we can develop along the multiple dimensions we value & track -be it garden yields and quality, the experience of volunteer participation, as well as other social, ecological & economic inputs & outputs. Primary Responsibilities Managing & coordinating all aspects of farm & garden work, including but not limited to: helping plan out, start and maintain seasonally rotating crops; seed/start & supply procurement; irrigation & weed management; garden planning & infrastructure improvement projects; organic/humane pest abatement (mostly ground squirrels); guiding & demonstrating farming skills/tasks to weekly community workers, and occasionally anchoring larger volunteer work parties. Required Qualifications Preferred 3+ year(s) of experience at an farm manager, assistant manager or similar; however, we’ll consider less experience for those extremely capable who can show a solid track record in other applicable areas of responsibility Experience planning seasonal crops and rotations, direct sown & greenhouse started Good record-keeping/organizational skills and time tracking, with computer literacy and proficiency in Word, Excel & Google Docs/Sheets Excellent communication & interpersonal skills, confident, self-motivated & self-managing with the ability to work both independently & collectively Experience or enthusiasm for training & educating stewards & volunteers Commitment to organic, sustainable & slow food philosophies & a passion for farm-fresh healthy eating with strong enthusiasm for our mission-driven service work to support wellbeing & just and sustainable communities Fluency in Spanish not required but a huge plus! Ability to lift 30+ pounds Valid CA Driver’s License, operating motor vehicle, active car insurance, and proven track record of operating a vehicle safely – part of this job may require driving to pick up supplies.

      "text": "The Greatest Customer Service Story Ever Told, Starring Morton's Steakhouse - Peter Shankman The Greatest Customer Service Story Ever Told, Starring Morton's Steakhouse - Peter Shankman No menu assigned! The Greatest Customer Service Story Ever Told, Starring Morton’s Steakhouse By Peter Shankman 08/18/2011 Business , Business Hacks , Customer Service , Future Forward , How I... , Marketing , Personal , Speaking , Success , Travel Comments 19 0 The following story is entirely true. More importantly, I swear on my entire professional reputation and all I hold dear to me that the story below was in no way staged, planned in advance, or in any way faked. This is real. And most importantly: This is AMAZING. When my alarm clock went off at 3:30 this morning, I knew I was in for a long day. I was catching a 7am flight out of Newark to Tampa, Florida, for a lunch meeting in Clearwater, then heading back to Newark on a 5pm flight, getting me in around 8:10pm, and with any luck, to my apartment by 9 or so. We all have days like that, they happen from time to time. Made my flight, everything was on time, got to my lunch meeting. Because of the training/workout schedule I’m on, my first meal of the day was that lunch. Was fine, I had a healthy piece of grouper, and a very successful lunch meeting that lasted just about three hours. By the time I got back to the airport, it was close to 4pm. Flight boarded at 4:30pm, and I knew that by the time I got home, I wouldn’t have time to stop for dinner anywhere, and certainly didn’t want to grab fast food at either airport. When I got on the plane, my stomach was a rumbling a bit, and I had visions of a steak in my head. As I’ve tweeted and mentioned countless times before, I’m a bit of a steak lover. I go out of my way to try steakhouses all around the world when I can, and it’s one of the reasons, no doubt, that my trainer at my gym is kept in business. But it’s all good – give and take. Over the past few years, I’ve developed an affinity for Morton’s Steakhouses, and if I’m doing business in a city which has one, I’ll try to schedule a dinner there if I can. I’m a frequent diner, and Morton’s knows it. They have a spectacular Customer Relations Management system in place, as well as a spectacular social media team, and they know when I call from my mobile number who I am, and that I eat at their restaurants regularly. Never underestimate the value of a good CRM system. Back to my flight. As we were about to take off, I jokingly tweeted the following: Let’s understand: I was joking. I had absolutely no expectations of anything from that Tweet. It’s like how we Tweet “Dear Winter, please stop, love Peter,” or something similar. I shut off my phone and we took off. Two and a half hours later, we landed at EWR. The fact that a flight got into EWR on time during summer thunderstorm season is a miracle in itself, but that’s not important right now. Walking off the plane, I headed towards the area where the drivers wait, as my assistant Meagan had reserved me a car home. Looking for my driver, I saw my name, waved to him, and started walking to the door of EWR, like I’d done hundreds of times before. “Um, Mr. Shankman,” he said. I turned around. “There’s a surprise for you here.” I turned to see that the driver was standing next to someone else, who I just assumed was another driver he was talking to. Then I noticed the “someone else” was in a tuxedo. And he was carrying a Morton’s bag. Now understand… I’m a born-and-raised New York City kid. It takes a lot to surprise me. A LOT. I see celebrities on the Subway. I see movies being shot outside my apartment, and fake gunfire from any given CSI show, five days a week. I’m immune to surprises. Except when they’re like this. Alex, from Morton’s Hackensack walks up to me, introduces himself, and hands me a bag. He proceeds to tell me that he’d heard I was hungry, and inside is a 24 oz. Porterhouse steak, an order of  Colossal Shrimp, a side of potatoes, one of Morton’s famous round things of bread, two napkins, and silverware. He hands me the bag. I. Was. Floored. Let’s make sure we’re clear on a few things here… 1) I was joking in my Tweet. I never, ever expected anything to come of it other than a few giggles. 2) Morton’s Hackensack is 23.5 miles away from EWR , according to Google Maps. That meant that in just under three hours, someone at Morton’s Corporate had to see my tweet, get authorization to do this stunt, get in touch with Morton’s Hackensack, and place the order. Then Morton’s Hackensack had to cook the order, get it boxed up, and get a server to get in his car , and drive to Newark Airport (never an easy task, no matter where you’re coming from) then, (and this is the part the continues to blow me away,) while all this was happening, track down my flight, where I was landing, and be there when I walked out of security! Are you taking this all in? Because it happened to me, and I still can’t even fathom it. Think about all the things that could have gone wrong: My flight could have been delayed or diverted. I could have exited out a different location. (Had I taken the AirTrain and not had a driver, I never would have even exited that way!) I could have just missed him all together, I could have landed early, etc., etc… I have no doubt that countless companies think like that. They think along the lines of “Oh, too many logistics. That’ll never work,” and they leave it at that. But what if it does work? What if it happens, and it works perfectly, and it shocks the living hell out of the person they do it to? Like it did tonight? And what if that person’s first thought is to make it public? Like I did tonight? We live in a world where everyone you meet is a broadcaster. Look around. Think of all your friends, all your colleagues. Do you know anyone anymore who doesn’t have a camera in their phone, or anyone who doesn’t have a Facebook or Twitter account? As I say in my book over and over again, customer service is no longer about telling people how great you are. It’s about producing amazing moments in time, and letting those moments become the focal point of how amazing you are, told not by you, but by the customer who you thrilled. They tell their friends, and the trust level goes up at a factor of a thousand. Think about it: Who do you trust more? An advertisement, or a friend telling you how awesome something is? Of course, I immediately tweeted out what happened: And sure enough, Twitter lit up like a bottle rocket. Click the image to expand it, it’s worth reading. When I got home, I actually looked inside the bag at what Morton’s gave me, and again, was blown away: And as to be expected, the food was amazing. Of course, there immediately came a few tweets from the other side of the camp, specifically calling out that I have over 100k Twitter followers, and if I didn’t, this never would have happened: But you know what? I don’t think that’s the case. I don’t think it’s about my follower numbers. I think it’s about Morton’s knowing I’m a good customer, who frequents their establishments regularly. If you look at their Twitter stream, Morton’s is known for always being on the ball, thanking those who mention they’re eating there. Just a recent few tweets from Morton’s proves this: So I don’t think the number of Twitter followers I have played a big (if any) part in this story. So… What can we learn? Stay on top of what people are saying about you. Respond accordingly. Perhaps most importantly, have a chain of command in place that actually lets you do these things in real time. Had Morton’s had to get permission to make this happen, at 5:10pm on a Wednesday night, there’s no way it ever would have. Complete and utter respect and admiration to Morton’s The Steakhouse. This was the amazingly gooey icing on an already great day. Thanks, Morton’s. In this day and age of online businesses, customer service and loyalty is increasingly important, read this guide on customer loyalty if you want to learn more . PS: Possibly the greatest part of the story? NASA the Wonder Cat, (brother of Karma, who passed away a few weeks ago,) got a very unexpected dinner – not of cat food, but of several small bites of a Porterhouse steak from Morton’s Hackensack.

Cheers! 🙂 Reply Jack Gault says: 04/16/2018 at 11:08 Right now I’m here in Doug Rigg’s SkillPathSeminar in King Of Prussia PA. He just showcased your Morton’s experience as an example of a purple cow … Both made me hungry for a steak. Jack Gault West Chester University of PA Reply Nev says: 04/07/2020 at 22:43 Interesting take. Culture plays a part as well. In the US these days customer service seems to come at a cost. Reply Linda Larson Schlitz says: 05/13/2020 at 22:14 What an incredible story…just love it!  Now I am trying to find your quote about offering people great service and they will bring you the customers you want…. something like that.! Reply NANCY B.
