We had to initially change our reservation to a little later as we were initially planning for the same time that Hurricane Eta came through. The staff was reasonable enough with the change but when contacting them over the phone for various questions it was hit or miss for getting someone that was pleasant versus unpleasant. We ended up having the same experience with people at the front desk. Most were pleasant and helpful, but they do seem to keep some around that just love being nasty to you, which really detracts from what could be a great park. As long as the park isn't full, the wifi is pretty good, but once the park fills up the wifi simply doesn't work and we had to resort to using our phones as individual hotspots instead of the camp wifi. There are times of the day when the aircraft noise from the airport and the navy base is near constant and this is a real pain to trying to enjoy your time here. I would be highly skeptical of the recommendations from the front office for things to do and services like cart and car rentals. It's pretty clear that the ones they recommend benefit them more than you. We followed their recommendations for renting a cart to drive around but had an impossible time trying to communicate with the vendor as they didn't speak English and were very reluctant to even talk to us. When it was dropped off they gave us no overview of the features, like where the gas tank was or even how to return it, so we assumed that as they dropped it off right at our site, they would pick it up the same way. Turns out that return procedure is VERY different and the front office people were quite nasty about making that known to us. I really like most of the amenities at this place in terms of good functionality and working order. The sites are generally clean and reasonably level to begin with, which is nice. What is lacking is a bit of space. Expect your neighbors to be right on top of you and we even had one put up a pop-up shade within inches of our rig into our site, which was more than a little annoying and rude. The beaches at the park are generally non-existent, even though they say they have two. Which is a real shame, because they are situated such that they could really offer some decent beach options. One is reasonably accessible, but has a no swimming sign. The other is only big enough for about 5 lounge chairs and filled with coral rocks at the waterline ranging from small pebble size to as large as golf balls and makes for a really unpleasant experience trying to enjoy the water. It just seems like they want you to see the water but don't touch it or go in it unless you have a boat. They have a boat launch and even a special bobcat tractor service to help move boats from parking areas to the launch. They also have a similar motorized tug service to help park 5th wheels in tight spots, which there are plenty. The park is a bit too far from town to be easy to access via walking or biking, but scooters, golf carts, and small cars. parking can be dicey in town, so be aware. Most of the food places in town, including some of the marquis places are mediocre at best and rather overpriced. This applies perfectly to the two closest restaurants to the park, Roostica Pizza and Hogfish, and just about every place we ate in town.  My general impression of Key West is that it's a giant tourist trap that doesn't deliver good value for your dollar. I would consider staying here again with lower expectations than I initially had, but I doubt I will return to Key West because it just isn't worth the hassle, over-priced everything, and throngs of generally rude people.

My wife and I needed to get some work done around 5 am in the morning and so there were some tables by the game room to sit down. The man was watching TV and doing nothing else in the game room and we asked if we can sit by the tables outside of the game room. The man's character was very nasty towards us and as I asked multiple questions, he was very rude and kept telling us to come back because the game room opens at 11 am, which didn't make sense since a sign said the game room opens at 8 am and the tables to sit down weren't outside away from the game room. He kept repeating the same thing with a negative tone towards us, possibly because we were a lot younger than he was. We had to find a shower room to work inside as he would not allow us to do our work anywhere else. \r\n\r\nThe camp may have been wonderful but how an employee treats their customers is what determines the greatness of any camp. We shall never be returning here again. Read Less Helpful 20 Own this park?

We ended up having the same experience with people at the front desk. Most were pleasant and helpful, but they do seem to keep some around that just love being nasty to you, which really detracts from what could be a great park. As long as the park isn't full, the wifi is pretty good, but once the park fills up the wifi simply doesn't work and we had to resort to using our phones as individual hotspots instead of the camp wifi. There are times of the day when the aircraft noise from the airport and the navy base is near constant and this is a real pain to trying to enjoy your time here. I would be highly skeptical of the recommendations from the front office for things to do and services like cart and car rentals. It's pretty clear that the ones they recommend benefit them more than you. We followed their recommendations for renting a cart to drive around but had an impossible time trying to communicate with the vendor as they didn't speak English and were very reluctant to even talk to us. When it was dropped off they gave us no overview of the features, like where the gas tank was or even how to return it, so we assumed that as they dropped it off right at our site, they would pick it up the same way. Turns out that return procedure is VERY different and the front office people were quite nasty about making that known to us. I really like most of the amenities at this place in terms of good functionality and working order. The sites are generally clean and reasonably level to begin with, which is nice. What is lacking is a bit of space. Expect your neighbors to be right on top of you and we even had one put up a pop-up shade within inches of our rig into our site, which was more than a little annoying and rude. The beaches at the park are generally non-existent, even though they say they have two. Which is a real shame, because they are situated such that they could really offer some decent beach options. One is reasonably accessible, but has a no swimming sign. The other is only big enough for about 5 lounge chairs and filled with coral rocks at the waterline ranging from small pebble size to as large as golf balls and makes for a really unpleasant experience trying to enjoy the water. It just seems like they want you to see the water but don't touch it or go in it unless you have a boat. They have a boat launch and even a special bobcat tractor service to help move boats from parking areas to the launch. They also have a similar motorized tug service to help park 5th wheels in tight spots, which there are plenty. The park is a bit too far from town to be easy to access via walking or biking, but scooters, golf carts, and small cars. parking can be dicey in town, so be aware. Most of the food places in town, including some of the marquis places are mediocre at best and rather overpriced. This applies perfectly to the two closest restaurants to the park, Roostica Pizza and Hogfish, and just about every place we ate in town.  My general impression of Key West is that it's a giant tourist trap that doesn't deliver good value for your dollar. I would consider staying here again with lower expectations than I initially had, but I doubt I will return to Key West because it just isn't worth the hassle, over-priced everything, and throngs of generally rude people.

My wife and I needed to get some work done around 5 am in the morning and so there were some tables by the game room to sit down. The man was watching TV and doing nothing else in the game room and we asked if we can sit by the tables outside of the game room. The man's character was very nasty towards us and as I asked multiple questions, he was very rude and kept telling us to come back because the game room opens at 11 am, which didn't make sense since a sign said the game room opens at 8 am and the tables to sit down weren't outside away from the game room. He kept repeating the same thing with a negative tone towards us, possibly because we were a lot younger than he was. We had to find a shower room to work inside as he would not allow us to do our work anywhere else. \r\n\r\nThe camp may have been wonderful but how an employee treats their customers is what determines the greatness of any camp. We shall never be returning here again. Read Less Helpful 20 Own this park?

The sites were quaint and surprisingly peaceful given how crowded it is. There is a laundry facility, pool, lounge area with a pool table, and a very clean shower house and bathroom with sinks for dishwashing. There is a food truck called Deluna’s on site that does breakfast-dinner and has great Cuban coffee. The staff are friendly and helpful and the views cannot be beat.

I am so close to my neighbor right now I can hear the conversation on his phone!!!! That he has been on for an hour after quiet time. Also if you are close to the bathroom in the tents then you hear everything from that. People washing dishes after hours and the bright lights shining into your tent.

This is really a very nice campground for all size of camping rigs or tents with a boat ramp and boat slips.  On Stock Island where the local University, Hospital, Golf Club and  the Police Department, as well as commercial fishing, marinas and restaurants are located.  Key West is a short bike or bus ride away.  The campground has great facilities for swimming, sunning, wine parties, potlucks, etc. On our recent visit the family which owns and runs the park provided a buffet dinner at the pool for all campers to celebrate their 60th year in business. Many of the campers have been coming for years. The only drawback is that it is hard to get into and expensive.  But Key West always provides great weather!

Both times stayed ocean side which is really on the water on the back bay. Sites are on the smallish side but when Boyd’s opened it was in the early 60’s when campers were small and the lots were large.  Don’t let that scare you off, they make it work. Pool and deck area are well maintained and relaxing. Plenty of tropical trees and plants and warm breeze to remind you this really is paradise. Laundry facilities clean, change machine, on wall, books to thumb through as you wait. Shower houses are ample, water is hot, doors lock. Dumpsters throughout the park. Tent area for rustic camping. Dish washing area should you need it. Boat docks, launch and fish cleaning station. Pet friendly. (Hey, kids, Boyd’s gives away iguanas free of charge to anyone who can catch them. Don’t tell Mom or Dad. Let it be a surprise for when you get home.)  Boyd’s is actually on Stork Island which is a stones throw to Key West. Easy and fast check in, friendly staff.

Everything you need is almost provided there but service is lacking a lot. Today in the morning as September 2nd, we called the office for a refund as they said they would be happy to help before but it has been 7 weeks and they are not helping at all. They hang up phones on you, very afraid to tell you their names as they know that they are charged for something bad. There are other RV campgrounds in Key West where you can get great service from! The only reason they are on top of google search because they are paying google ads, which shows on the little corner, so do not fool for it. Share Report C C.J. C.

Site 117 Month of Visit August Share Report Alex M. Legend Reviewed Aug. 10, 2022 Deluxe island camping I rolled into Key West without any clear idea of where I was going to stay. Boyd's was the first place I came across, and I felt no need to look any further. I was initially concerned about crowding here, but Boyd's had multiple waterfront tent sites available on a weeknight in August. I got my pick, and it came with shade trees, a picnic table, and iguanas. Incredible. This campground's top selling point is its location. If it were anywhere else, I might have grumbled about the price, or the tightness of the campsite, or the proximity to neighbors (they are mere feet away). But, you're in Key West, literally right on the water, and close enough to downtown that you can get there by bicycle (or, in my case, kick scooter). This felt like an amazing bargain, especially when you factor in the excellent bathrooms and the large, clean, temperature-controlled swimming pool. There is also a camp store and a laundry room. Every amenity you could ask for, basically. There was even fast WiFi coverage throughout the whole campground, a first in my experience. If I ever journey back to the southernmost point in the continental US, I would stay at Boyd's again in a heartbeat. This campground ticks all the boxes.

It was easy to get an Uber ride to Key West and the bus stopped real close.   The site was big and plenty of room.    The entire place was pet friendly.   The only “negative” was the sandy mud.

Their bathrooms are usually not very busy since there are so many RVs - with a popup it’s nice to have empty bathrooms.  Boyd’s close proximity to Key West is also awesome since you can rent a golf cart or scooter to get into town to do all the fun things!

But it’s located on a very pretty bay where you can watch boats as well as fighter jets from the naval air station. It’s 15 minutes from the heart of key west. There is a Cuban food truck in the park and I highly recommend the con leche! There is a well-stocked store as well. Watch for falling iguanas! They sun themselves in the trees.

If we had chosen a tent site on the water with elec/water then it would have been a bit bigger...but still tight. If you park just right and place your tent just so then you can get more privacy but not much more. The bathhouses were nice and it was great to have laundry and a cute town nearby. The ‘One Love’ Food Truck about .5 miles away made the whole experience super great. Best Food Truck ever! There is a local gym walking distance away too. Lots to do and a short drive to Key West. The price was a bit high for the squeezed in spaces but worth it to us for the location and amenities. Share Report P Portia H. Guide Reviewed Jan. 14, 2021 Great location and very nice tent camp experience Boyd’s Campground, Key West, FL\r\nCampsites are tight—and I mean tight, Tent and RV alike.  The interior tent sites are tiny.  A 3 person tent is about all that will fit as you must also park your car there as well.  The tent sites with power are a little larger.  The primitive tent sites on the water are of varying size and tend toward pie shape which limits configuration of tents as your vehicle must head into the site at the narrowest point.  If you have a small tent, the views are lovely.  Small RVs and vans can also use these sites.  The more parallel waterfront tent sites are closer to the RV sites and preferred if you have a larger tent (we have a Big Agnes bunkhouse 6–9x10 without the vestibules.  We were originally assigned 18T and could not put up our tent and park our Jeep and still get out of our tent!  We were then assigned 28T which was better but no way the 20x25 foot site we were told.  There are also tent sites with power over in the RV village with “beachfront”—note that while you could walk into the water, it’s not really suitable.  These sites did appear to be much deeper and would allow a larger tent and a 10x10 shade shelter.  Each site has a charcoal grill of varying degrees of decline- some had new, ours was seriously rusted out and difficult to use.  The newer ones allow you to turn them adjusting to wind direction.  Ours was fixed.  They said they are gradually changing them out.  Also a 6’ picnic table—nice configuration because you do not have to step over the seat to sit down.  The surface is hard packed coral “sand”.  Be sure to bring your tent brush as this stuff blows in.  And the waterfront sites are windy!  The wind direction changes frequently.  Putting up a tent and taking it down can be a challenge.  Our site faced the naval air station so when wind came from the east, we heard national anthem and taps across the water.  The waterfront tent sites are probably the best locations in Boyd’s—on the point.  You almost feel like you are camping at the beach as the water is literally right there at your feet.  There are some RV waterfront sites as well which are nice. The bathrooms are well maintained and clean, the showers hot and the dishwashing sinks very nice.  There are ramps up so no worries if cannot do steps.    The laundry is big and clean.  $2 for wash, $2 dry.  The office sells ice ($3.50 for 10 pounds versus Publix at $3.29) and large firewood bundles (we didn’t use).  The campstore/registration office carries some basic food and camping supplies, has hot coffee and frozen entrees—there is a microwave there if you need to use it.  Bike and 50cc scooter rentals in front of the office. Consistently helpful and cheerful Staff are constantly around so felt very secure.  Sites are raked between occupancy.  Most campers were respectful and quiet.  Most also masked while in the laundry and shop. Read More (6) View All Share Report R Ryan S. Scout Reviewed Jan. 11, 2021 Not the best I try to be a positive person however this campground, like all campgrounds in the keys, RVs are packed in like sardines and the prices are expensive! If you come her make sure you bring everything you need because the prices in the store here are outrageous! The staff is very friendly and helpful. One thing I've never seen anywhere but here is the sewer has no way to attach or strap down your sewer hose to their septic, the pipe going in the ground is not threaded. I thought that was very strange. I had to buy a longer sewer hose which is not their fault but they only sell a hose with no ends on it so you have to also buy the ends and build your own sewer hose. Safe travels everyone. Share Report C Charlie Traveler Reviewed Dec. 31, 2020 Best campground! Very clean and a lot to do in the area. Front desk was very polite and helpful.  Can’t wait to go back!!

Boyd's History The Road to Boyd’s: Stories by Boyd Hamilton By boydscampground_admin March 4, 2025 0 The Life & Times of Boyd Hamilton ~ By Boyd Hamilton – Key West, Florida, July 1996 A few years ago, when I retired from running the campground on a day-to-day basis, I had an opportunity to reflect on the many years of my life. What a full life I have lived. I began to realize that not even those closest to me know the full extent of my adventures—so I started writing them down. It’s become quite a project! But these stories represent more than just my life story. They are a permanent record of a way of life long since passed—a time when people saw things from a different perspective, when things were done differently, and opportunities looked very different. Perhaps the reader will get to know, in some small way, some of the fine people I’ve known—my parents, my grandparents, and others who are now long gone. These stories are also a tribute to my family, especially my wife, and the many people I’ve met along the way. They have all helped shape the adventurous and fulfilling life I’ve been blessed to live. It has been—and still is—a great life. I hope you enjoy reading these stories as much as I’ve enjoyed writing them. I’ve done my best to leave out anything inappropriate and to tell the truth as I remember it—or as the world appears to me. Our First Camper, 1947 Elsie and I were married on June 25, 1947, and by late October, we were ready to hit the road in our homemade camper. It was just big enough for two people—and not just any two people. You had to be very compatible and not too big. It was built to our own specifications—could you say it was custom-built? It was just high enough for me to stand upright. The bed ran crossways and was only 41 inches wide. That left just enough room at the back of the truck for a chest of drawers on one side, a built-in clothes closet on the other, and a small fold-down plywood table. A two-burner camp stove was fastened to the top of the chest of drawers. The whole camper measured eight feet long and seven feet, three inches wide. We were off—from Saskatchewan to see the U.S.A.—and we had the whole winter to do it. Looking back now, I’m sure we looked exactly like what we were: a couple of country bumpkins. But that didn’t slow us down. We were doing our thing, and our thing was to see as much of the U.S.A. as we could that winter of 1947–1948. At the time, Canadian law limited the amount of money you could take out of the country to $150 per person—$300 total for the two of us for the entire winter, which we hoped would last four or five months. We hid a little money here and there in the camper, but we knew we’d still be tight. We were both raised poor during the 1930s and knew how to get by on very little. We brought a bag of potatoes—but those froze before we even got out of Canada. We didn’t throw them away right away, but eventually, foam started coming out of their eyes, and we had to admit they were done for. Elsie canned a few apples we bought cheap in Illinois as we kept on moving. Of course, we never ate out, and we only visited things that were free. We traveled from Winnipeg to Chicago, to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami—then finally arrived in Key West on New Year’s Day, 1948. It cost $1.00 per day to stay at Mastic Trailer Park on United Street. That gave us a parking spot and use of the toilets and showers. While laying on the beach, we heard about a new thing called a credit card. I wrote to our Esso dealer in Sylvania, Saskatchewan, asking for one, and he sent me his. After that, we were in clover—we brazenly charged food, gasoline, even cash. After a month in Key West, we hit the road again—New Orleans, Los Angeles, up the West Coast through Oregon and Washington, then back east through Montana and into Regina. We made it home to Sylvania by late March. It was a great trip—one we’d never forget. We made a complete circle of the U.S.A. and spent less than $700 total. That covered food, gas, camping, and everything else for four and a half months. Back home, we took the camper shell off the truck and got back to work. We spent that summer keeping bees and making honey—trying to earn enough money to do it all over again the next fall.
