About the Lodge. The Lodge Designed to evoke the memory of the Old West, The Lodge at Red River Ranch has been welcoming guests to rustic comfort for over 30 years. We are the premier luxury hotel of Capitol Reef. The Lodge was constructed with heavy log framing and elegant furnishings to create a truly unique and inviting atmosphere. The focal point of the Lodge is our three-story Great Room â a warm and relaxing space that instantly feels like home. Here guests can play, mingle, or lounge after a day of exploration. Our fifteen unique guest rooms and suites are tastefully decorated with antique furnishings and authentic decor, and each room is complete with its own fireplace. The Bison Perhaps the greatest symbol of the Old West is the American Bison. Herds of bison once roamed over the plains and mountains of the West. We at Red River Ranch are privileged to raise bison in a sustainable fashion on 2,000 acres of pristine pasture land. Guests are encouraged to admire and photograph our bison from behind the fences, but please do not approach them. Capitol Reef The Lodge at Red River Ranch is located on historic Utah Highway 24, standing at the gateway to the unspoiled Capitol Reef National Park. Capitol Reef is something of a secret, even to native Utahans. But those lucky travelers who visit the park never forget the time the spend there, the trails they hike, and the breathtaking scenery. The Lodge is also located a convenient distance from other major national parks, like Bryce Canyon and Zion. Both only a day-trip away. We invite you to come experience Capitol Reef, to relish your stay at the Lodge, and to capture the ineffable spirit of the Old West. â The Lodge at Red River Ranch Reserve Now 435-425-3322 Get to know us.

Shop Men Shop Women OUR FOUNDERS STORY In 1984, two entrepreneurial brothers from South America named Fernando and Santiago Aguerre founded REEF out\n          of a love for the beach and surfing. Their idea was to create high-quality, super comfortable products that\n          fit the lifestyle they loved. Fernando and Santi walked everywhere, so they created sandals that could take\n          them to the beach, into town, and wherever they wanted to go - in comfort. The brothers redefined, redesigned\n          and reengineered every component of the sandals. That attention to detail and an uncompromising standard of\n          quality made Reef the most comfortable sandals anybody had ever worn. The innovations that started in 1984\n          have evolved into the Reef sandals we love today, becoming a symbol of a free, comfortable and happy\n          lifestyle.
