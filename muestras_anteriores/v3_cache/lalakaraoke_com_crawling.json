Since opening to great fanfare three years ago on the dot, LALA has established itself as a mainstay in St. Pete and a star in the Grand Central District. Located at 2324 Central Avenue, LALA is much more than a typical karaoke bar. In fact, the main bar and dining room only even have karaoke a few nights a week. The real sing-along fun takes place inside LALA’s seven private karaoke rooms, spread across the ground floor and second floor, offering themed experiences for parties as small as just a few or as big as 18 people. ADVERTISEMENT While enjoying karaoke, groups are able to order from the kitchen and bar menu, and we certainly recommend sticking around for more cocktails after the fun. For bachelor and bachelorette parties, corporate happy hours, birthday celebrations, or just a fun night out with friends, the private karaoke room experience is perfect for groups of any kind. LALA also hosts open mic nights in the dining room five days a week, for those brave enough to rock the microphone in front of a crowd. Open mic takes place on Wednesday and Thursday from 9 pm to close; Friday and Saturday from 10 pm to 1:30 am; and during Sunday Brunch from 1 pm to 4 pm. Stellar drinks and dining at LALA Meanwhile, the inspired food menu at LALA has become a bit of a cult sensation, for those in the know. LALA features a unique and upscale menu showcasing American and French dining, with Mediterranean influences. Dinner reservations are available here. The dinner menu offers an incredible selection, with appetizers like charred Spanish octopus and housemade meatballs; entrees such as filet mignon, baby back ribs, and duck linguini; and a sandwich menu that includes some of the best burgers we’ve had anywhere. (LALA’s truffle aioli burger is rich, decadent, and packed with flavor in every bite.) No matter the time of the day or night, there is always excellent food available. LALA features different menus for lunch, dinner, brunch, late night, dessert, happy hour, and even kids. Don’t skip the LALA happy hour, either, offering fantastic specials Monday-Friday from 4-6 pm. Plus, on Tuesdays, guests get 20% off the entire bill and 50% off karaoke rooms. Then, on Wednesdays, everyone gets 50% off bottles of wine and champagne, as well as 50% off karaoke rooms. And the rooftop bar at LALA may very well be the best seat in town, a shaded and lively balcony overlooking Central Avenue as well as the beautiful courtyard. On that note, the shared courtyard with next-door neighbor Grand Central Brewhouse is one of the most enjoyable social spots every weekend, packed with people and events from Friday happy hour through the end of Sunday Funday. SoHo Tampa marks second LALA location While we love having LALA down the street, we can’t keep all the fun on our side of the bridge. After a lengthy search for the perfect location, LALA just opened its second location in Tampa’s SoHo neighborhood. The upscale karaoke bar and restaurant is officially open at 208 South Howard Avenue, bringing a star in St. Pete to the other side of the bridge. LALA Tampa features eight unique rooms that can fit up to as many as 25 people in the biggest ones, with themes such as Moulin Rouge, Gatsby, Nashville, Hip Hop and more. Rooms are already in high demand, so if you’re headed over for a night in Tampa, we also recommend securing reservations, which are available here , though walk-ins are welcome as the schedule allows. Beyond the karaoke, the covered outdoor patio is the jewel of LALA Tampa, and already it has become one of the most highly sought after seats in town, whether you’re in for a night of karaoke or just want drinks with a breeze. Having seen firsthand the excitement LALA brought to Central Avenue in St. Pete, we’re thrilled to see what they do in the lively SoHo neighborhood in Tampa.

If you haven’t heard of them before, they are a jazz project featuring members of well-known Tampa Bay bands stepping outside their usual sound. Blending their backgrounds into something unexpected, this group brings a fresh take on jazz with familiar faces in less familiar territory. Catch them live and see what happens when musicians push past the edges of their genre. 11 0 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 17999308943656733 11 0 Our latest collaboration with @pointybelbrew, Rice Rice Baby, is a clean and refreshing rice lager brewed with Riverbend Pilsner malt and jasmine rice. The rice lends a delicate floral aroma and a subtle sweetness that lightens the body while keeping the finish crisp and dry. Perle and Saaz hops add gentle spice and a touch of herbal character that complement the malt and rice without overpowering them. The result is a bright lager with notes of toasted baguette and fragrant jasmine blossom, culminating in a clean, refreshing close. At 4.5% ABV, this lager shows that true complexity can be found in simplicity. Rice Rice Baby is on tap now, and we`ll also be pouring it today, Sunday August 31, at the Cool & Crispy Festival at Point Ybel Brewing. Stop by and grab a glass! 33 2 Open post by grandcentralbrewhouse with ID 18057786497113047 33 2 On Sunday, August 31 at 2 PM The Fernando Cruz Trio returns to Grand Central Brewhouse for an afternoon of rich, expressive jazz led by saxophonist, composer, and educator Fernando Cruz.
