Emilia reviews: Farm Vigano — the perfect summer venue Photo provided by Ugo Cassio Photo provided by Ugo Cassio Photo provided by Ugo Cassio Photo provided by Ugo Cassio Our History The Farm Viganò at South Morang, was purchased by Mario and Maria Teresa Viganò in 1934-35, and sold soon after Mario’s death. The property, with house, farm buildings, and designed landscape, provides the last tangible physical association with Mario and Maria Teresa Viganò, and is able to demonstrate their remarkable contribution to cuisine, hospitality, culture and the arts. This is on account of its long use and association with Mario Viganò, the patriarch of Melbourne’s, and probably Australia’s, most prominent restaurant family. Mario Viganò (1888-1966) was among a small number of Italian emigrants who pioneered the introduction of Italian and other cultures to the mono-culture of Anglo Celtic Australian society. ‘Mario’s’ restaurant in Exhibition Street Melbourne, and ‘The Farm’ at South Morang were the principal venues for his contribution to Australian society.

But how can you make sense of the many social media options and use your time effectively? In this post, we’ll help you hone in on the top event social media platforms. Plus, we’ll show you how to leverage them to maximize your reach and event leads . Basics of social media for venues Developing a venue social media strategy Best social media channels for event venues Let’s start with the basics of social media for venues. Before you dive in, take a deep breath. There’s a lot of noise out there about venue marketing ” and you might feel pressure to step up your social media game. Before you join every platform on the horizon, start with these simple but crucial steps: Define your goals with your venue social media. Do you want to grow your following? Drive more leads? Make your objectives clear. Identify your target audiences. These can be general buckets, like potential clients, event planners, and event attendees. The more you can define each of those segments’ profiles, the better. Develop your strategy to find your audience and drive your goals. Easier said than done, right? Keep reading to find out how to form your strategy. [Tweet “Social media for venues requires time, effort, and strategic planning.”] Get the 3D diagramming to market your space on social Get Started Now Developing a venue social media strategy You’ve probably heard the phrase, if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Well, that holds true when it comes to your venue’s social strategy. Luckily, there is a wealth of helpful resources online to ensure you start off on the right foot. Many marketing tools, like Hubspot and Coschedule , offer a slew of helpful tips, as well as free templates that’ll make deciding what to post ” and when to post it ” much easier. You can whip up an easy doc or spreadsheet that lists the social media platforms you’re on, when you make a post, and what that post consists of. “Strategy” sounds complicated, but the basic rules are fairly clear-cut: 1. Use social media to build relationships and provide value for your followers. For every post that promotes your venue, you should also share three or four posts that don’t try to sell anything. What you share is limited only by your imagination. Some ideas: Photos Videos Infographics Announcements Blogs posts Articles Countdowns to big events or news Testimonials Photo or caption contests Surveys Polls, Quotes Funny moments Post-event highlights FAQ answers Memes or gifs Social media takeovers Check out your competition for inspiration of what else to share. 2. Use visual storytelling It’s no secret that, whether it’s LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter, the posts that get the most engagement are usually ones that feature some element of multimedia, whether it be an image, a video, or even a GIF. That’s because these types of posts are more eye-catching and dynamic than ones that only have text, or text with a URL. If you don’t have photos or videos on hand, sites like Unsplash offer hi-resolution photos for free that you can search through with terms like coffee or bistro to find an image that will coincide well with the content you’re posting. However, it’s always ideal for the imagery used to be high-quality and reflective of your actual event space ” whether or not you’ve got the budget for a professional photographer. When thinking about social media for venues, consider that your potential customers want to envision their event in your space. You’re marketing to planners who want to transform your space to fit their needs. Use visuals to tell the story of your space. How flexible is your venue? What types of events have you hosted, and how different did they look? Telling the story of each event with visuals will give planners the creative spark they need to envision their event in your venue. You might also try hashtagging your #localevents or offering a photo incentive for your followers to crowdsource your visual content. Your guests aren’t just searching for a hotel, but a hotel in the area they are traveling to for work or play. These trips are often scheduled around local events, tourist attractions, city-wide conferences, and niche interest areas. While your gut instinct may be to hashtag all of your posts on hotel topics, or your city or state”utilize year-round, one-off, and recurring events as a method of generating engagement through hashtags. This can bring about a new level of brand awareness with event goers who have never stayed at your property. You also can create a photo incentive to gather user-generated visual content. Incentivize guests to show off their experience on social media in exchange for perks during their stay or entice event planners with special catering options for their next event. 3. Respond authentically Posting is important ” but social media isn’t a billboard. It’s interactive, and it serves you best when you interact. No matter how prepared and dedicated you are to your venue’s social media presence, you won’t get the traction you could be getting without making sure you’re posting with authenticity and responding to your fans. That means that you shouldn’t use these platforms purely for self-promotion of your business ” you should also be interacting, engaging and conversing with your fans, followers, and others in your field and industry. Moreover, your content should be consistent with your brand’s aesthetics and message ” if you’re all about sustainable ingredients or your boasts a colorful interior featuring a mural from a local artist, those are things worth touting. The more people feel like they’re seeing content from a human being and not just a brand, the more they’ll be likely to stick with you. 4. Actively blog A blog can make it easy to maintain your social media channels ” you’ll always have content to share. Better yet, a blog will help show prospective clients what it’s like doing business with you and what goes on behind the scenes. Start with easy-to-produce content like event recaps and team or client interviews, and then test out more complex topics. Respond to comments, be consistent with posts, include links to your site, and do your best to engage your audience. 5. Create raving advocates across all social channels It’s no secret ” some of the best marketing for your venue won’t come from your own staff. It’s via word of mouth and follower-generated content like reviews and comments. The happier your clients are when their event is over, the more likely you are to receive a “thank you” via social media. And that review can easily lead to another booking. Encourage clients to review you on Yelp and Facebook and share photos from their events. You can also create new advocates by reaching out to get the attention of local “influencers.” Celebrities aren’t the only social media influencers. In fact, there are tons of event bloggers and influencers whose social media following is envious. But how do you get them to post or blog about your hotel? Offering them a free weekend at your hotel or resort, all expenses paid (including airfare if you’re not in the same city). In exchange, have them post photos or write blog posts that highlight all that your hotel has to offer. Cross-post their photos and blogs across your social media accounts to show off your property. 6. Analyze your approach Don’t forget to assess how well your venue’s social media strategy is working. Every social platform offers data about your posts, so take advantage of what’s offered to you. Follow the numbers to track your progress, what works, and what still needs tweaking. 7. Keep handle names consistent Especially if your name isn’t a super unique one (like The Beachside Grill vs. The Tybee Island Social Club), keeping your social media handles the same, or as similar as possible, will make organically searching for your business on various platforms much easier. For example: With a company like Gather, it’s probably not surprising that the handle Gather was already taken by the time the company launched a few years back. Thus, we had to get creative ” in the end, we chose to be GatherTech across social media, so that we stood out with a more unique name (that still accurately represented us), without there being confusion or an endless list of generic search results. Try the world’s most popular event diagramming Get A Demo The best social media channels for event venues 1. Facebook With 1.56 billion daily active users on Facebook , it should be no surprise that Facebook is ranked as the most important social platform for marketers. Here are the secrets to success on Facebook: The more your followers engage with your posts (by commenting, liking, or sharing), the more they’ll see you in their newsfeed. Figure out which of your posts generate likes and comments, and post similar content more often. Facebook has a remarkable number of groups built around common interests . You can create content to foster discussion and engagement within these groups (and potentially reach new customers). Features like Messenger make it possible to build personal relationships with potential customers. Because Facebook users share their interests and demographics, Facebook’s targeted advertising can be a great option for event venues. Use Facebook Live to multiply your organic reach Within Facebook, there’s one feature that we love to call out specifically: Facebook Live . Because your followers get a notification when you start streaming, it’s a great way to get their attention. Consider a monthly tour of your venue, a tutorial, or a behind-the-scenes interview. Use your Facebook Insights Page to see when your followers are online to get the timing right. And make sure you stay live for at least 10 minutes to optimize reach . Share your fans’ content on Facebook The Roger Smith Hotel in New York City uses Facebook as an opportunity to turn their guests into their best ambassadors. By becoming co-content creators, guests play a hands-on role in growing the network and influence of the hotel. That’s one of the reasons the Roger Smith has been recognized as one of the most innovative hotels in the world. If neither of those two tactics appeals to you, you can always use targeted ads for advertising or re-marketing . These offer a way to target multiple demographics at once. 2. Twitter With almost 350 million users and 500 million Tweets posted per day, this platform is perfect for quick and easy updates. You can share daily or even multiple times a day. Not sure how to use Twitter for your event venue promotion? Here are some ideas: Twitter is ideal for retweeting and resharing content from by others. As a result, it’s used by many as a great source of industry news . Visuals attract more engagement. Plus, when you use images in your Tweets, you can tag people without it counting toward the character count. Embedding your Twitter feed into your venue’s website . This lets visitors know that you’re active. Beyond that, Twitter is great for engagement at events. For example, at live events, you can project a Twitter Live Wall on a big screen, which encourages engagement of event attendees. Here’s another example: The Hyatt Regency in Chicago uses Twitter to engage event attendees and overnight guests. Live Twitter walls draw conference participants into conversations and comments. At the same time, guests benefit from improved and highly responsive concierge services via Twitter, addressing both issues and questions in record time. 3. Instagram This visual platform is becoming bigger and bigger, with over 95 million posts a day and 400 million Instagram Stories a day. What’s the appeal? People buy from brands they trust, and Instagram helps build that trust. In fact, in 2017, 80% of users willingly connected to a brand on the platform.  The combination of a visual with a caption and hashtags makes this platform ideal to build that kind of relationship. In terms of content, Instagram calls for polished phots, such as your venue the day of a big event, details, and behind-the-scenes images. Use Stories and hashtags to build your venue brand on Instagram Instagram users can now follow hashtags ” not just profiles. This broadens the opportunities for planners and potential clients to stumble upon your venue on Instagram. Similarly, you can promote your venue with Instagram Stories. Stories are a series of images and video only available for 24 hours. You can add drawings, emojis, polls, Q&As, links, and even tags. As a bonus, you can select a few stories to highlight in your profile, letting followers discover your Story collection at their leisure. For inspiration, check out the QEII Centre in London. Its Instagram profile features a Story that showcases the venue during London Fashion Week. They tag the designer for some win-win visibility. (QEII won Venue of The Year at the AEO awards 2018, Most Versatile Venue at the London Venue Awards 2018, and Best Venue Customer Service at the London Venue Awards 2017. They must be doing something right!) 4. Pinterest If you have ample photos of your space, don’t just use them for your website. Use Pinterest to showcase your venue and to inspire planners considering your venue. Try to showcase your venue’s versatility. Create a board for social, corporate, or association events. Or, show your venue during the day versus events hosted at night? There’s no shortage of how you can show off your space on Pinterest. 5. LinkedIn If your venue hosts corporate events or meetings, then LinkedIn, a B2B platform, is a great place to devote some strategic efforts. On LinkedIn, connect with your past customers and potential clients. Post similar content to engage these connections. Using social media tools to make your job easier Even if it still seems overwhelming, we promise you can do this. There’s even an app for that! Many social media management tools can make your life easier. Start with a scheduling app. These apps let you plan posts across channels ahead of time and see all the analytics at once. You have lots of options, like HubSpot, Hootsuite, or Buffer. These tools typically offer a free option, which you can use to familiarize yourself with the tool. Their paid options offer greater access to services. In terms of creating content, photo editing apps and sites (such as Canva ) can turn a photo into a meme or a header image in just a few clicks. You might even have fun doing it! At the end of the day, there’s no such thing as an overnight success. So, as you learn how to promote a venue, start small and slow with your social strategy. Then grow organically as you figure things out. Take the time to define your brand and voice ” and be authentic.

Conference & Events Office conferenceoffice@chch.ox.ac.uk +44 (0)1865 276174 CHRIST CHURCH, OXFORD - TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR VENUE HIRE These Terms and Conditions accompany a Proposal (the “ Proposal ”) issued by the member of Conference Oxford named in the Proposal (“ us ”) for the hire of the Venue described in that Proposal. These Terms and Conditions, together with the Proposal and any annexes, schedules or other documents incorporated in such documents, comprise a legally binding agreement between us and agreed between us and the person identified as the Hirer in the Proposal (“ you ”) (the “ Agreement ”). The Agreement governs the hire to you of the Venue for the purposes of the Event, together with the provision of any associated catering services, accommodation or other additional services which we have agreed to provide. In relation to some Venues, as will have been identified in the Proposal, the catering services to be provided to you in connection with the Event may be subject to a separate contract between you and the relevant caterer, to which we are not a party and for which we are not responsible. The Agreement may be formed before the Proposal is complete (for example, if you have yet to determine certain details of the Event or to provide certain information). The parties may update the Proposal or associated documents such as menus or accommodation requirements from time to time by written agreement, including in e-mail correspondence and in these terms and conditions a reference to the Proposal is to the most recently-agreed iteration of the Proposal together with its associated documents. 1. Interpretation 1.1 Capitalised terms in these Terms and Conditions have the meanings given in the Proposal if no other meaning is given below. Otherwise: “ Accredited Supplier ” means a supplier of goods or services (such as floristry, lighting, staging, AV equipment or entertainment) on our list of approved suppliers; “ Fees ” means those fees payable to us identified in the Proposal, together with any other fees, costs or charges payable to us in accordance with these Terms and Conditions; and “ Premises ” means our premises, including the Venue and any accommodation or ancillary areas which we may permit you to use. 1.2 Unless the context otherwise requires: i) the singular includes the plural and vice versa; ii) words following the terms “ including ”, “ include ”, “ in particular ” or similar are illustrative rather than exhaustive; and iii) reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as amended from time to time. 1.3 Any reference to our consent, approval or instructions refers to consents, approvals or instructions from our Event Manager (who shall serve as your first point of contact and who may escalate matters to the University Representative as appropriate) or from the University Representative during the Hire Period. 1.4 In the event of any conflict between any Special Terms set out in the Proposal and the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, the Special Terms shall prevail. 2. Hire and Payment 2.1 In consideration of the payment by you of the Fees, and compliance by you with the obligations set out in this Agreement, we will make the Venue available to you for the Hire Period, for the purposes of the Event (subject to our rights of substitution under clause 5.13) and provide any agreed catering, accommodation or other additional services to you. 2.2 Once the Agreement is formed, we will issue an invoice for the Deposit in accordance with the Proposal. 2.3 Except in the circumstances described in clause 12.4, the Deposit is non-refundable. 2.4 All sums are stated exclusive of VAT, which will be payable in addition where applicable. 3. Co-ordination 3.1 The person named as your contact in the Proposal is responsible for co-ordinating all necessary arrangements relating to the Event with our Event Manager. During the Hire Period your and our Representatives shall both remain at the Venue and shall liaise in relation to the conduct of the Event. Your Representative must remain sober, on site and available at all reasonable times during the Hire Period. 3.2 You warrant that: (a) the person named as your contact in the Proposal has authority to agree all aspects of the use of the Premises for the Event, and to agree amendments to the Proposal, with us from time to time; and (b) your Representative has authority to ensure compliance by all Visitors with the requirements of the Agreement, and in particular with our instructions to safeguard the Premises and their contents. 3.3 You must ensure that all Visitors are aware of the relevant requirements of the Agreement, fully comply with them, and follow the instructions of our personnel. 3.4 We are entitled to be present at the Premises at all times. The entrance of the Premises will be staffed by our personnel throughout the Event. You will provide a representative to accompany them in order to identify Guests and other Visitors. 3.5 At least fourteen (14) working days prior to the Event, you must provide to us: (a) a full list of Visitors must be provided to us at least fourteen (14) working days prior to the Event, in particular including details of any high-profile Guest(s) who may require additional security protection which you propose to arrange, or any special accommodation requirements; and (b) a final draft of the Event programme (to the extent not already agreed with us) in order for us to confirm its conformity to the services we are able to offer. (in particular as regards meal times). 3.6 We will not unreasonably refuse a request from you to increase or decrease the number of Guests from the number specified in the Proposal, provided that: (a) the request is made in good time (and no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the Event); (b) we may require the payment of an additional Deposit in relation to increased numbers; 3.7 If we are providing catering services to you, you must work with our Representative to ensure that all dietary requirements or allergen information of any Visitors have been communicated to us accurately and in good time prior to the Event, within such timings as we may specify. If you have not done so, it will be your responsibility and not ours to ensure that any special dietary requirements are met. You must also ensure that you have obtained the express consent of each Visitor to the disclosure to us of their dietary requirements. We do not guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all dietary requirements. 3.8 We will not admit to the Premises any person who has not been identified to us in advance as a Visitor. 3.9 If any members of the press are expected to attend the Event, you must request permission from us at least fourteen (14) working days prior to the Event, designate a representative to remain with them at all times and inform us in advance of the identity of that representative. 4.

We may require you to implement, and/or to pay the cost of, any special precautions we require to address such risk. In particular, if any aspect of the Event may involve any fire risk you must seek written approval from us at least thirty (30) days in advance of the Hire Period. 4.3 Without limiting your other obligations under this clause 4, you agree and acknowledge that: (a) our staff are entitled to a dignified and supportive working environment. We insist that they are treated with dignity, respect and courtesy at all times, and reserve the right to immediately remove from the Premises any person who bullies or harasses our staff or who we otherwise determine has behaved unacceptably towards them; (b) it is of paramount importance to us that our reputation and core values are upheld, including in relation to ethical practices and social responsibility. We reserve the right to halt any activities at the Venue, and refuse entry to or remove any person, whose conduct is incompatible with that reputation and those core values, including in relation to any: (i) unlawful activity, such as libellous, infringing or discriminatory activity, or any involvement in national or international crimes; (ii) activity which we otherwise deem to be inappropriate, unseemly or offensive, especially if not disclosed to and approved by us in advance. 5. The Venue, Accommodation, Access and Occupation 5.1 You may only occupy the Premises during the Hire Period, and any agreed access for set-up and breakdown. Without limiting our other remedies, we may charge an overrun fee if you or any Visitors occupy the Venue beyond the Hire Period. The overrun fee is £350 per half-hour of occupation, plus any additional costs which may be incurred by us. 5.2 Guests may only arrive at the Premises at the Start Time and must report to the entrance (and check-in area if appropriate) agreed with the Conference Office. We will specify any areas of the Venue and/or Premises which can be used for preparation or set-up for the Event, and any permitted times for set-up (which will not include any period during which the Venue is open to the public). 5.3 Unless otherwise agreed with us, if you have booked accommodation at the Premises, the accommodation shall be: (a) allocated by us and subject to change (although we will endeavour to give you as much notice as possible of any changes to the accommodation arrangements); (b) available only to Guests over the age of eighteen (18) years old; (c) available for Guests to check-in from 2pm on the first day of the Event and must be vacated by 10am on the final day of the Event; and (d) payable in full at the agreed rate set out in the Proposal, including if it is unoccupied by any Guest who fails to attend the Event for any reason. 5.4 No changes, additions or alterations in or to the Premises (interior or exterior) and/or the contents thereof may be made except as agreed in writing in advance by us, all of which shall be of a temporary nature only and strictly necessary for the purposes of the Event. You may not erect scaffolding or affix screws or nails to any building, structure or object at the Venue or the Premises without our prior written consent. 5.5 No equipment or structures of any kind may be erected on or attached to any part of the Premises, its contents or our equipment without our prior written approval. 5.6 Proposals for any temporary structures or fixings, supports for heavy-equipment, ground protection, and the like must be submitted for our approval at least forty-five (45) days before the Hire Period. All such items must be erected in accordance with applicable British Standards and to our satisfaction. 5.7 Furniture, paintings, display cases or other contents in or at the Premises may not be moved without our prior written consent, and then only by our staff or under their direct supervision and at your additional cost. 5.8 You must take precautions to prevent damage to floors or floor coverings.

In particular, we may do so in connection with remodelling or with the relocation of antiquities, artworks or other precious objects. We will use reasonable endeavours to notify you as early as possible of any such substitution. 6.

You may not advertise the Event to the public by any means without our prior written approval. 7. Insurance We strongly recommend that before the start of the Hire Period you take out public liability insurance cover with a reputable insurer, to a level of cover of at least £5,000,000 per occurrence, either in your name or in the name of your representative (in which case both you and your representative must sign); to provide a level of cover in respect of all the risks which may be incurred by you in relation to the event. 8. Removal and Restoration 8.1 Unless agreed otherwise in writing, you shall be responsible for removing from the Venue, the Premises and any access routes before the end of the Hire Period and to the satisfaction of our Event Manager: (a) all equipment used for the Event (including, without limitation, toilets, temporary structures, mobile facilities) not supplied by us; and (b) all litter, waste or recyclable materials resulting from the Event, and if you do not we may conduct our own removal and charge you for our costs. 8.2 You shall be responsible for all costs of fully restoring and reinstating the Premises to its condition prior to the Hire Period.

We may remove and dispose of anything left at the Premises after the Hire Period. 9. Suppliers, Equipment, Catering and Entertainment 9.1 Unless otherwise agreed with us, you may only use Accredited Suppliers for the provision of services in connection with the Event. You acknowledge that: (a) any agreement with an Accredited Supplier is between you and the relevant Accredited Supplier. We are not party to that agreement and not responsible for the Accredited Supplier or its performance; and (b) breach of this obligation will entitle us to terminate under Clause 12.2 . 9.2 You shall provide, at your own cost, any equipment required by us or by any relevant authority for health and safety reasons (for example, additional fire extinguishers) unless we have agreed in writing to provide them. 9.3 You may only bring equipment into the Premises for use at the Event with our prior written consent, and upon provision by you or the relevant supplier of a valid certificate showing that the equipment has been tested in accordance with applicable health and safety regulations. You must ensure that all equipment is removed from the Premises in accordance with our instructions. 9.4 You must provide our Event Manager with a full list of suppliers and equipment to be brought on site at least fourteen (14) days prior to the event. 9.5 All suppliers must provide the Event Manager with a copy of their public liability insurance (to a level of cover of at least £5,000,000 per claim) valid at the time of the Event together with risks assessments and method statements for the work to be carried out. 9.6 Suppliers must report to the Premises reception desk and be escorted by our staff at all times whilst on the Premises. 9.7 The use of naked flames, strobes, smoke or haze machines, dry ice, internal fireworks, party poppers, crackers, balloons, soil, sand or similar items is not permitted within the Premises. Smoking and vaporising are not permitted within the Premises. 9.8 No trading may take place at any Event without our prior written approval, any approval may be conditioned on: (a) the relevant supplier having the required valid licences and regulatory documents and complying with all applicable legislation while carrying out trading activity; and/or (b) the payment of an additional Fee to us, in particular where such trading competes with our own trading or catering. 9.9 We may stop any trading and remove the relevant supplier if any of the conditions of trading required by us are not met. 9.10 Food and drink may only be consumed in the designated areas within the Venue. Visitors may not bring any food or drink to the Venue or consume any food or drink at the Venue other than as provided by us or, as agreed, by an Accredited Supplier approved by us. 9.11 You shall ensure that no alcohol is served at the Event or brought into the Premises (except where supplied by an Accredited Supplier) without our prior written consent. 9.12 We, or any relevant third party caterer, may verify the age of any person consuming alcohol in the Venue and may instruct bar staff not to serve any person behaving in an inappropriate or unseemly manner. 9.13 You may play live and pre-recorded music during the Event in accordance with our PRS and PPL licences. You must adhere to any specified maximum level of sound or time restrictions specified by us in playing music or in any other entertainment. 9.14 Where the Event incorporates licensable activities which are not covered by licences held by us or by a relevant third party caterer, you must obtain the required licences at your own cost and provide copies to us on request. 10. Safeguarding Under 18’s and Vulnerable Adults 10.1 The Venue has a duty of care to ensure that it does not permit any activity which puts any child or vulnerable adult within college premises at risk of harm. A full safeguarding policy can be found online www.chch.ox.ac.uk/about/safeguarding-policy , which applies to all guests and visitors. Unless otherwise agreed, only guests and visitors over the age of 18 years old are permitted to attend the Event. The following control measures have been put in place should any child or vulnerable adult attend the Event. a) Under 18’s to be accompanied by an adult at all times. b) Staff of the Venue who are not DBS checked are never alone with guests and visitors who are vulnerable or under 18. DBS checked staff should also avoid being alone with guests and visitors and if this is unavoidable, should try and remain in the public eye or where there is CCTV coverage. c) Training is given to staff of the Venue so that they understand and maintain boundaries and avoid one-to-one situations with under 18’s and vulnerable adults at all times. d) Staff of the Venue are trained in health and safety matters to ensure the health and safety of guests and visitors. 11. Indemnity and Liability 11.1 You will indemnify us (and any of our officers, employees, agents or contractors) against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by us or them arising from: (a) any third party claim brought or threatened against us or them arising from your breach of the Agreement, your negligence, or any other wrongful act or omission on your part or the part of any Visitor; (b) any third party claim brought or threatened against us or them otherwise connected with the Event or your use of the Premises (except to the extent such claim is attributable to our breach of the Agreement or our negligence); (c) any damage to the Premises, damage to or loss of any property at the Premises, or injury to any person caused by any Visitor; (d) misuse of our IT networks or facilities by you or any Visitor; or (e) your breach of the Agreement or any other negligence or wrongful act or omission on your part or the part of any Visitor. 11.2 We will notify you promptly if we become aware of any claim against which you are required to provide an indemnity under clause 11.1. We will not make any admission or settlement in relation to such claim without your prior written consent, which you may not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. 11.3 You must notify us promptly of any claim brought or threatened against you or any other dispute in connection with the Event, providing such details as we may require. 11.4 We are responsible to you only for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with this Agreement, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time we entered into the Agreement with you, both we and you knew it might happen: for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process. 11.5 We are not liable to you for business losses. We are providing our services to you for personal or private use. If the Event is for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity. 11.6 We are not liable for Visitor’s losses. We will not be liable to you for loss of or damage to any property owned or hired by you or any Visitor, except to the extent such loss or damage is our fault. We will not be liable to you for any loss suffered or incurred by you or any Visitor arising from any termination of this Agreement. 11.7 We are not liable for your acts or those of your Visitors. We shall not be liable to you for any loss you suffer arising from your own actions or omissions or those of your Visitors or those of any third party supplier (unless they are our sub-contractor). In particular, if we are not able to perform any obligations under the Agreement, or are delayed in performing them, as a result of those actions or omissions, we will not be liable to you. 11.8 Our liability is limited. Our total aggregate liability to you under this Agreement, or in connection with its subject matter, will not exceed: (a) an amount equal to one hundred and twenty-five per cent (125%) of the sums paid or payable by you to us under this Agreement (i.e. the overall contract price), if our liability arises due to our failure to perform our services with reasonable skill and care or to provide them in accordance with the main characteristics identified in the Proposal; or (b) otherwise an amount equal to the sums paid by you to us under this Agreement. Because our liability to you is generally limited, and because we do not accept liability for matters outside our control, we strongly recommend that you take out appropriate event insurance. 11.9 Where our liability is not limited nothing in the Agreement excludes or limits our liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any other matter for which liability cannot lawfully be limited or excluded. 12. Cancellation and Termination 12.1 Because the Agreement is a contract for the supply of event services during an agreed period of performance, you do not have any statutory right as a consumer to cancel the Agreement under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 or Consumer Rights Act 2015. The entirety of your rights of cancellation is set out below. 12.2 You may cancel the Agreement by written notice to us. In the event of cancellation, you must pay a cancellation fee. This fee will be the sum outlined in the Venue Hire Proposal and Booking Contract. 12.3 We may terminate the Agreement by written notice to you, and may retain the Deposit, if: (a) you commit a material breach of the Agreement and (in the case of a material breach which is capable of remedy) fail to remedy that breach within such a reasonable period of time as we may specify. In particular, if you have failed to obtain and provide evidence of necessary insurance, licences, consents, approvals or risk assessments as required by the Agreement then this will be a material breach which is incapable of remedy; or (b) you become insolvent or bankrupt, or are the subject of an administration, or enter into any voluntary arrangement with creditors, or are subject to any equivalent event or proceedings. 12.4 We may terminate the Agreement by written notice to you, and shall return the Deposit to you, if: (a) we are, or reasonably believe we will be, unable to perform the Agreement for reasons outside our control; or (b) we otherwise require any material changes in the arrangement of the Event which are not acceptable to you (other than any substitutions we may make under clause 5.13). We shall also return the Deposit to you if you cancel your booking by written notice within fourteen (14) days after receiving notice from us of any material revision to the Fees. 12.5 Termination of the Agreement, for whatever reason, shall not limit any rights or remedies of the parties which accrued prior to termination. 13. Pandemics 13.1 Both you and we agree to comply with any official guidance from UK Government in relation to any pandemic (including COVID-19), and to notify the other promptly of any impact such pandemic may have on the performance of our respective obligations under the Agreement. 13.2 You agree to comply with, and procure that all Attendees comply with, any measures which we may communicate to you in to ensure the safety of our staff and of Attendees. Without limiting that general obligation, we may take, and require you to comply with, reasonable measures such as (without limitation): (a) imposing maximum Attendee numbers at the event; (b) limiting food or drink availability, or changing the means by which either are served; (c) imposing specific requirements regarding personal protective equipment such as the wearing of masks, or specific safety measures such as the use of sanitiser or distancing procedures; or (d) limiting any planned entertainment for your Event. 13.3 We may acting reasonably revise the Price to reflect any measures taken (for example if buffet service is replaced by table service) and will notify you as early as is reasonably practicable of any such revisions. 13.4 If we are obliged to close the Venue or Premises due to Government restrictions, or if we decide to close them due to our own safety concerns, we will seek to agree with you an alternative date for the Event. If that cannot be agreed your booking will be cancelled and your Deposit will be returned. We will have no liability to you in connection with any such changes in date or cancellation. 13.5 You must notify us if the number of Attendees at the Event will be reduced due to infection or travel restrictions associated with a pandemic. If you provide us with at least fourteen (14) days’ notice prior to the Event of any reduction we will offer a proportionate reduction in the contracted numbers (to a maximum of 30% on the elements of your quote that apply to Attendee numbers.
