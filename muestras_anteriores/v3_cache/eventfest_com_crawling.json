Learn More Talent Buying Event Production Event Consulting Business Consulting Marketing Design Why We Exist We exist because we wanted to create a company that we wish existed when we started our first festival. We wanted a company that provided guidance, service, expertise and solved all of those little pain points that we didn’t even know existed until they did. We wished there was a partner out there that was actually a partner – someone that was affordable, who we could grow with, and who really cared about our business as much as we did. We couldn’t find it, so we set out to create it. As we’ve grown, we’ve seen what music and events can really do for people and it’s our mission to make events and music accessible to everyone. “We may operate in the entertainment business, but we are in the hospitality and service business to our core. Our goal is to elevate experience, one fan at a time, while making it a priority to leave an impact in the communities we serve. Our events will always be accessible to people with all levels of ability, we will always allow kids, we will always give local artists an opportunity to shine on our stages and we will always give back to the community. Music heals in more ways than one and our mission is to ensure everyone can be touched by it.” – Billie Jo Aasen If you can dream it, we can do it.

Although I would call it more of a family. This is my third year working with them. I have found out that they are dedicated to top notch service and they also give you many opportunities for personal growth and development. Between the Management and trainers they have many levels of training for your needed certifications. From First Aid, CPR, to OLCC and Dpsst training to crowd control. Plus the events we work are alot of fun from Monster truck shows, to rodeos, sporting events, and concerts it gives you a wide variety of things to see and hear. If you like the the freedom to schedule your time and also give you the chance to see alot of different areas this is the place to work. ​ J. Waver ​ \"This will be my fourth year working for TCB now. TCB is awesome because there's an amazing bond of teamwork, you can connect with your supervisors they're hard workers who are working out there right alongside you, they provide top-notch quality services, and it's also just so thrilling interacting with so many types of people and super satisfying at the end of the day knowing how many people you'v helped. Plus, it's a fun way to earn extra cash over the weekends. ​ G. Helland TCB is more than just event staff and security. It’s a company that creates memories, you pick what events you want to work. Anything from concerts to food festivals you choose it. Giving you the best of both worlds, making sure everyone is safe and also having fun. C. Landrom My experience with TCB has been wonderful.  In the time that I have been employed the staff was very welcoming and helpful with their training. It has always been an extremely professional environment, and the support from supervisors and staff has always been phenomenal.  Though the work can be a bit \"rough\" at times, it is clear how much hard work is valued among everyone as a team. I would compare TCB to a vacation you get paid to go to. Really great company to work for. ​ A. Rodregez Honestly I don’t even know where to begin with this, but let’s start with “thank you”! Getting this job has been a huge blessing as a high schooler because it’s by far the most flexible job in the planet. It’s awesome that you get to choose when you work but what makes it even better is the people. I have always hated working with negative people and so far at all the events I have worked at everyone and I mean everyone is crazy and fun and enjoyable to work along side. I can’t wait to move up the ranks and get to experience everything this company has to offer because every job is a new opportunity with new people and well who knows what could happen!! ​ N. Moan It's a great feeling to help keep our community events safe while seeing a little of some great events. Scheduling your own hours is a huge plus. ​ T.
