Meet the Park City Rental Properties Team Kenny Green President Jen Ali Director of Owner Relations Jim Anderson Business Development Executive With a background in Park City and Deer Valley real estate, Jim transitioned over to the vacation rental management world to help PCRP grow its owner base. He is an expert at networking, growing the sphere of influence, connecting with the local real estate community, and helping owners and Realtors better understand the rental market. His vast knowledge of the area and the vacation rental market allows him to guide people in the right direction when they are looking for cash flow properties. Jim has a Bachelor’s Degree in Real Estate Finance and Development from Central Michigan University. Operations Team Jake Mulvey Director of Operations Jake has called Park City home for over a decade. For the past seven years, he worked with the PCRP Sales and Revenue teams before recently transitioning to a role in Operations. A true enthusiast of everything Park City has to offer, Jake enjoys snowboarding, mountain biking, golfing, and hiking with his dogs. He holds an accounting degree from Appalachian State University. Caleb Weis Operations Manager Mitchell Heberer Operations Manager Witzen Rodriguez Operations Manager Owner Relations Team Jennie Munguia Owner Relations Manager Lynne LeBlanc Owner Relations Manager Amanda Evenstad Owner Relations Manager Amanda is a Utah native who brings a decade of experience in real estate and operations to her role as Owner Relations Manager. Her experience ranges from property renovations and HOA management to leading top-producing teams, equipping her with both strategic insight and on-the-ground know-how. Focusing on simplifying the complex details so owners and guests experience a smooth, worry-free stay. When she’s not helping properties thrive, you can find her at the local farmers' markets, hitting the slopes, or enjoying a good game of billiards. Sandra Engel Owner Relations Manager After spending 15 years as an International Tax Manager with KPMG, I decided to trade spreadsheets for something a little more “chill” (haha) and joined Park City Rental Properties in 2017. Shortly after starting, I became the Regional Onboarding Manager for all our locations (busy, busy) and now part of the Owner Relations team.\n \nWhen I’m not helping owners, you’ll find me making the most of Park City’s charm—soaking up the summer sunshine, catching a show or concert at The Egyptian Theatre, enjoying outdoor live music and fun festivals, or exploring hiking and biking trails. Add in a glass of good wine, good friends, and some crisp mountain air, and I’m exactly where I want to be. × Get In Touch 314 Main Street, Suite 101 Park City, Utah 84060 (435) 200-1223 reservations@parkcityvacationrentals.com Follow Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Owner Login Popular Links All Park City Rentals All Deer Valley Vacation Rentals All Canyon Rentals Additional Communities Search All Vacation Rentals Holiday Rentals Alphabetical Property List About Us Our Rentals Condo Rentals Home Rentals Mansion Rentals Ski In/Out Spring Rentals Rental Deals © 2025 Park City Rental Properties Vacation Rentals Know the unit name?

Ranch activities have included cattle ranching and citrus, tree and turf farming, and aggregate mining. SMR transitioned into community development in February of 1994, and operates LWR Communities LLC and LWR Realty as subsidiary companies responsible for residential and commercial development. Today Lakewood Ranch is home to more than 74,000 residents and 2,645 jobs. The community features vibrant town centers, top-rated schools, the Lakewood Ranch Medical Center, Lakewood Ranch Golf & Country Club, Premier Sports Campus, and Sarasota Polo Club. SMR has preserved approximately 46% of the land for conservation and parks. SCHROEDER-MANATEE RANCH, INC., IS ONE OF THE STATE’S MOST SUCCESSFUL LAND MANAGEMENT AND AGRI-BUSINESSES.
