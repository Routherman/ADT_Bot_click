For the past 20 years, Steve’s focus has been on starting and scaling Revolution, the Washington D.C.-based investment firm that backs entrepreneurs at every stage of their development and makes strategic investments in real estate and hospitality. Revolution has invested nearly $2 billion in companies including Anduril , Sweetgreen , CAVA , Tempus , DraftKings , and CLEAR .  The firm has maintained a particular focus on backing entrepreneurs outside of traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley. Through its Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Revolution has invested in more than 200 startups across over 100 U.S. cities, in partnership with many of America’s most successful entrepreneurs and investors. Revolution’s real estate and hospitality arm, Revolution Places , includes ownership of Exclusive Resorts , a luxury residence club and community; Punta Cacique , a wellness-focused development in Costa Rica anchored by the country’s first Waldorf Astoria; and significant land holdings in Hawaii, including Maui Land & Pineapple and Grove Farm . Steve’s entrepreneurial career began in 1985 when he co-founded America Online (AOL). Under Steve’s leadership, AOL became the world’s largest and most valuable Internet company, driving the worldwide adoption of a medium that has transformed business and society. AOL was the first Internet company to go public, and the best performing stocks of the 1990s, delivering a 11,616% return to shareholders. At its peak, nearly half of Internet users in the United States used AOL. In 2000, Steve negotiated the largest merger in business history, bringing together AOL and Time Warner in a transaction that gave AOL shareholders a majority stake in the combined company. To facilitate the merger, Steve agreed to step down as CEO when the merger closed. Steve’s passion for helping entrepreneurs remains his driving force. As Co-chair of the National Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, the Council advised on the development of a National Entrepreneurship Strategy and policies that will ensure America’s competitiveness globally. In 2011, he was the founding chair of the Startup America Partnership— an effort launched at the White House to accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the nation – and member of President Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness where he chaired the subcommittee on entrepreneurship. Steve has been a leading voice in shaping government policy on issues related to entrepreneurship, working across the aisle to advance public policies that expand access to capital and talent. He was instrumental in passing the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act, the Investing in Opportunities Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and is active in advocating on behalf of immigration reform and legislation that supports and accelerates the emergence of startup ecosystems in rising cities. Steve also served as the Chair of the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum and research complex. In this role, Steve led the Board of Regents’ efforts to increase the Institution’s reach, impact and relevance. Steve is also Chairman of the Case Foundation , which he established with his wife Jean in 1997. Together the Cases have invested in hundreds of organizations, initiatives and partnerships with a focus on leveraging the Internet and entrepreneurial approaches to strengthen the social sector. In 2010, Steve and Jean joined The Giving Pledge, and publicly reaffirmed their commitment to give away the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes. Steve is also the author of bestselling books Rise of the Rest: How Entrepreneurs in Surprising Places are Building the New American Dream and The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur’s Vision of the Future. Steve was born and raised in Hawaii and retains active ties to his home state, but has lived in the Washington D.C. area for more than 30 years. Back to team Join the Revolution!

Quick Facts Early Life, Career, and Family Boston Tea Party Midnight Ride Later Years and Death Paul Revere House Quotes Who Was Paul Revere? Paul Revere was an American revolutionary who famously warned a colonial militia of approaching British soldiers on April 18, 1775. Before the war, the Boston colonist was a respected silversmith and artisan. Revere began to support American independence in the 1760s and later took part in the Boston Tea Party . His legendary midnight ride on horseback and a notification system of lanterns he devised contributed to the patriots’ victory in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which began the Revolutionary War. The folk hero died at age 83 in May 1818. Among the memorials in his honor is the Paul Revere House, now a museum where he once lived. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Paul Revere BORN: January 1, 1735 DIED: May 10, 1818 BIRTHPLACE: Boston, Massachusetts SPOUSES: Sarah Orne (1757–1773) and Rachel Walker (1773–1813) CHILDREN: 16 ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn Early Life, Career, and Family Paul Revere was born on January 1, 1735, in Boston. At the time, the port city was part of the Britain’s Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was the son of Apollos Rivoire, a French Huguenot who immigrated to America at age 13, and Deborah Hichborn, a Boston native and the daughter of an artisan family. Rivoire, who anglicized his own name to Paul Revere soon after arriving in America, was an artisan himself. After a long apprenticeship with a goldsmith, the elder Revere set up a shop in the sometimes rough North End section of Boston. When he was old enough, his son Paul, the third of nine children and eldest living son, left school to become his apprentice. By all accounts, the young Revere was a serious and committed artisan. When he was 19, tragedy struck when his father died, leaving him to support his mother and siblings and take over the silversmith shop, though he was technically too young to be in charge of the business. In 1756, Revere enlisted in the provincial army, likely to earn a steady income, but returned home just months later. Soon, Revere also had his own family to care for. In 1757, he married Sarah Orne, with whom he had eight children. Not long after her unexpected death in 1773, Revere married Rachel Walker, with whom he had another eight children. Revere, who augmented his income by becoming an engraver and dentist, was a master goldsmith by the 1760s, faring well in a colonial city that was struggling economically due to British tax policies. His clients included both artisans like himself and the city’s upper class, whose homes were adorned with Revere-made tea sets and spoons. Boston Tea Party Even as his business did well, Revere took stock of the situation around him. As others struggled, he sensed that his own livelihood could soon be affected unless issues with the British were soon addressed. In 1760, Revere joined the Freemasons, America’s oldest fraternal organization, and befriended other activists such as James Otis and Dr. Joseph Warren. As his confidence in his leadership abilities grew, so did his responsibilities. More American Revolutionaries Abraham Woodhull Molly Pitcher Patrick Henry Following the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765, which imposed taxes on printed materials in the American colonies, Revere joined the Sons of Liberty, a clandestine political organization that aimed to fight British taxation. As tensions between the colonies and the British deepened, he was tapped to spy on British soldiers and report on their movement for the group. In addition, he worked as a courier for the Boston Committee of Correspondence and the Massachusetts Committee of Safety. In a brazen act of defiance in 1773, he and others dressed as Native Americans and dumped tea into the Boston Harbor to protest British taxation, launching what came to be known as the Boston Tea Party. Midnight Ride Getty Images Despite the significance and renown of the Boston Tea Party, it was Revere’s midnight ride on April 18, 1775, that etched his name into history, especially after it was later immortalized by the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . That night, fellow Freemason and American revolutionary Dr. Joseph Warren summoned Revere to inform him that British soldiers, also known as British regulars, stationed in Boston were preparing to march into the countryside of Concord, Massachusetts, to capture or destroy military stores of weapons and ammunition. Warren also claimed that British troops were coming to arrest Sons of Liberty leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams in the nearby town of Lexington. This particular piece of intelligence turned out to be inaccurate, but Warren “begged” Revere to ride to Lexington to warn their fellow patriots. Before he left, 40-year-old Revere contacted an unidentified friend and instructed him to hang two lit lanterns in the bell tower of Christ Church to signal that the British would be traveling by sea instead of land. The silversmith then took a boat across the Charles River, slipping past the British war ship HMS Somerset . After arriving safely on land, he borrowed a horse from merchant and patriot John Larkin in Charlestown. At around 11 o’clock at night, Revere set off on horseback toward Lexington and Concord. Narrowly avoiding capture from British patrol outside of Charlestown, he took a different route through Medford, warning colonial minutemen captain Isaac Hall as well as nearly all of the houses on the road. Revere arrived in Lexington just after midnight. As he approached the house where Hancock and Adams were lodging, a soldier standing guard, Sergeant Monroe, told him not to make so much noise. “Noise! You’ll have noise enough before long! The regulars are coming out!” Revered yelled . Hancock recognized his voice and let him in the house, where he relayed the message. Despite common misconception, Revere wasn’t a lone rider but one of several. Half an hour after he delivered the news that British troops were approaching, another messenger William Dawes arrived on horseback. The two “refreshed themselves” and continued their journey to Concord to confirm that their military stores were hidden and secure. Along the way, they were joined by fellow Sons of Liberty member Dr. Samuel Prescott but were soon stopped by British patrol. Keep Reading The True Story of Paul Revere’s Ride While Dawes and Prescott managed to escape, Revere was captured and held for questioning. He was eventually released but had his horse confiscated, forcing him to return to Lexington on foot to assist Hancock and Adams, who were leaving for Woburn, Massachusetts. Revere reportedly heard gunshots as he helped carry a trunk of sensitive papers Hancock had left behind. The Battles at Lexington and Concord ensued, and with it, the American Revolution . Revere’s warnings played an important role in the colonists’ victory in these first clashes. During the war, Revere donned many different hats. He manufactured gunpowder and cannons for the Continental Army, printed the fledgling country’s first money, and commanded Castle William at Boston Harbor. Later Years and Death Following the Revolutionary War, Revere continued to build on his reputation as a master craftsman and industrialist. He learned to roll copper and opened the United States’ first copper-rolling mill. He also operated a hardware store and later a foundry. Respected for his work and charitable contributions, including his involvement with the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association, Revere retired from working life in 1811 but still remained politically active. He died in his home city of Boston on May 10, 1818, at 83 years old. Paul Revere House Getty Images Paul Revere’s house in Boston is now a museum. Today, one of the most prominent landmarks commemorating the American revolutionary’s many contributions is the Paul Revere House . Built in 1680, the colonial home is the oldest building in downtown Boston. Revere owned the three-story house from 1770 to 1800. After he sold the building, it was used as a boarding house for sailors before being turned into a tenement in the 19 th century. The ground floor was remodeled as a storefront that was home to various businesses, including a candy store, bank, and cigar factory. In 1902, John P. Reynolds Jr., who was Revere’s great-grandson, bought the house to prevent it from being demolished. It was subsequently renovated by the Paul Revere Memorial Association, of which the folk hero’s great-granddaughter Pauline Revere Thayer was a member. By 1908, the Paul Revere House had become a museum open to the public. Around 80 to 90 percent of its original structure still remains intact. Other memorials to Revere include an equestrian statue located in Boston’s North End, as well as his grave at the city’s Granary Burying Ground. Quotes The regulars are coming out! The regulars are coming out! We were so careful that our meetings should be kept secret that every time we met, every person swore upon the Bible that they would not discover any of our transactions but to Messrs. Hancock, Adams, Doctors Warren, Church, and one or two more. In the winter, towards the spring, we frequently took turns, two and two, to watch the soldiers by patroling the streets all night. If the British went out by water, we would show two lanterns in the North Church steeple, and if by land, one, as a signal. I set off upon a very good horse; it was then about 11 o’clock, and very pleasant. I was a constant and critical observer of [Dr. Church], and I must say, that I never thought him a man of principle, and I doubted much in my own mind whether he was a real Whig. If a man will risk his life in a cause, he must be a friend to that cause. I asked the Major to dismiss me, he said he would carry me, let the consequence be what it will. He then ordered us to march. Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness. If you see something that doesn’t look right, contact us !

Posted on February 13, 2018 April 30, 2018 Sum 41 with Seaway & Super Whatevr Doors: 6:30PM Sum 41 will be performing their FULL record, Does This Look Infected?, to celebrate its 15th Anniversary! Sum 41 hit worldwide radar in 1996 after tiny Ajax, Ontario proved unable to fully contain the foursome’s mixture of punk-pop riffing, hip-hop poses, and toilet-bowl humor. Led by guitarist/vocalist Deryck Whibley, the band also included guitarist/vocalist Dave Baksh, bassist Cone McCaslin, and drummer Steve Jocz. Wooed by the boys’ goofy antics and incendiary live show (and excited about the prospect of promoting their very own blink-182), Island put Sum 41 on the payroll in 1999. The Half Hour of Power EP followed, and Warped Tour dates got the word out. They returned in 2000 with the fun-filled full-length All Killer No Filler, and the singles “In Too Deep” and “Fat Lip” became staples of both modern rock radio and TRL. An extensive tour followed, and Sum 41 enjoyed their success the way all near-teenage boys would, with plenty of towel-snapping, groupie-loving, and self-deprecating, low-ball humor. In 2002, they returned to wax with Does This Look Infected? While the album was a bit harder-edged, it found the band just as jazzed as ever to mix punk-pop business with sophomoric pleasure: the video for “Hell Song” featured the fellas acting out a sort of rock star debauchery cage match with the aid of a few celebrity action figures. Metallica, Jesus Christ, and the Osbournes all made appearances in the hilarious clip. It was not all fun and games, however, as their involvement in the charity group War Child Canada had Sum 41 lending a hand in the making of a 2004 documentary covering the effects of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five days into filming, fighting and gunfire suddenly erupted around them, and they barely escaped unharmed — these events led to 2004’s slightly more mature and serious effort, Chuck, named for the UN aid worker, Chuck Pelletier, who was instrumental in getting them to safety. The DVD Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo was released at the end of 2005 and the live album Go Chuck Yourself appeared the following March. Guitarist Dave Baksh left the band during the spring of 2006 due to creative differences, going on to form the metal-punk outfit Brown Brigade. Sum 41 continued on as a trio, and their first album as such, Underclass Hero, appeared in July 2007. The band eventually returned to being a quartet, replacing Baksh with guitarist Tom Thacker, and began to work on a new album. That new album, entitled Screaming Bloody Murder, appeared in March of 2011. “Blood in My Eyes,” a single from the album, was nominated for a Grammy that year. However, due to a series of back injuries for Whibley, Sum 41 would not return with new material for half a decade, despite their critical success. During the break, Jocz left the band and was replaced by Street Drum Corps’ Frank Zummo. Baksh also returned to the fold, just in time for Sum 41’s comeback in 2016. The group signed with Hopeless Records. Their sixth LP, 13 Voices, featured the lead single “Fake My Own Death.” While promoting the album, Whibley revealed that he was in an alcohol-related induced coma in 2014. While recovery included learning to walk and play guitar again, Whibley contributed a large part of his healing to the writing process of 13 Voices. To coincide with the album release, the band embarked on an international tour dubbed “Don’t Call It a Sum-Back.” Posted on February 13, 2018 April 30, 2018 The Wonder Years with Tigers Jaw, Tiny Moving Parts, and Worriers Doors: 7PM Taking its name from the TV show The Wonder Years, the Philadelphia punk pop band was formed by guitarists Matt Brasch and Casey Cavaliere, vocalist Dan “Soupy” Campbell, bassist Josh Martin, drummer Mike Kennedy, and keyboardist Mikey Kelly. The sextet got its start in 2005 when previous combo the Premier split up. Regrouping under the new name, the band began playing shows and released two split singles that year (with Bangarang! and Emergency and I). In late 2007, the Wonder Years self-released an album, the emphatically titled Get Stoked on It!, and quickly caught the eye of California label No Sleep, which signed the band. Their first record for the label was the EP Won’t Be Pathetic Forever, which came out in June of 2008. Following a split single with All or Nothing, Kelly left the band. After a year spent recording its second album, the group released The Upsides in January of 2010. The record made a dent in the lower regions of the Billboard charts, and gained the Wonder Years a deal with the larger indie Hopeless, which reissued the album in September with four bonus tracks. In the time between releases, drummer Kennedy quit the band and was replaced by Nick Steinborn. Kennedy soon returned to the fold and Steinborn bounced over to play keys and guitar. With the lineup solidified, the Wonder Years got to work on their next album with producer Steve Evetts. In 2011, they released their third album, Suburbia I’ve Given You All and Now I’m Nothing, followed by the arrival of a B-sides compilation, Sleeping on Trash, as well as their fourth full-length album, The Greatest Generation, in 2013. The following year, lead singer Campbell released his first album with his solo project Aaron West & the Roaring Twenties, We Don’t Have Each Other, with Campbell adopting the persona of Aaron West in his songs. After Campbell returned from a tour with the Roaring Twenties, he began working on songs for the next Wonder Years project, but suffered a powerful case of writer’s block that triggered a severe bout with depression. Campbell eventually channeled the emotions stirred up by his struggles into the group’s fifth studio album, 2015’s No Closer to Heaven, a concept piece about coming to terms with the death of a loved one. The Wonder Years’ next release, 2017’s Burst & Decay EP, offered acoustic versions of songs from their three previous LPs. The group re-entered the studio later that year with producers Joe Chiccarelli and Carlos de la Garza to record their sixth album. The resulting Sister Cities was released in 2018 and saw them shifting their sound away from their pop-punk roots. Posted on February 13, 2018 March 12, 2018 DESCENDENTS Doors: 7PM Show: 8PM Support: Radkey, Rehasher Fueled by “rejection, food, coffee, girls, fishing and food,” the Descendents sprang up during the halcyon days of the Los Angeles punk scene; fusing the blind rage of hardcore with an unexpectedly wry, self-deprecating wit and a strong melodic sensibility that set them distinctly apart from their West Coast brethren. They gradually emerged as one of the most enduring and adored bands of their time. Formed in 1979, the Descendents initially sported an edgy power pop sound inspired by the Buzzcocks . Through ups nad downs and intermittent disbanding and rebanding, the Descendents returned in 2016 with Hypercaffium Spazzinate , their first new studio material in 12 years. The album delivers all those good Descendents feelings their fans love. “Each time we make a record it’s almost like the first time all over again,” says drummer Bill Stevenson . Posted on February 1, 2018 Saved By The 90’s The ultimate 90’s party! With a high-energy live band that performs from a list of hundreds of 90s songs, and a DJ who can spin before, after, and in between sets, Saved by the 90s is the world’s best and longest-running 90s party and they’re here to rock your world.

Posted on January 18, 2018 March 24, 2018 Between The Buried And Me w/ The Dear Hunter Between the Buried and Me is a thinking man’s hardcore unit hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina. The band began in 2000 after the dissolution of vocalist Tommy Rogers and guitarist Paul Waggoner ‘s previous group, Prayer for Cleansing . Rogers and Waggoner completed their new lineup with the addition of guitarist Nick Fletcher , bassist Jason King (ex- Azazel ), and drummer Mark Castillo , formerly of Bury Your Dead . An eponymous debut soon appeared, issued through the German indie Lifeforce, and the band supported its release with an avid tour schedule. Between the Buried and Me signed with Chicago hardcore powerhouse Victory in the summer of 2002 and began work on their debut for the label. The Silent Circus appeared in late October of the following year and showcased a more focused fusion of the group’s math rock, heavy metal, and post-hardcore influences. Several lineup changes ensued that saw Rogers and Waggoner rounded out by guitarist Dusty Waring, bassist Dan Briggs , and drummer Blake Richardson . Joining forces with producer Jamie King , who had recorded their self-titled effort, Between the Buried and Me released Alaska in September 2005. Various tour dates with the Dillinger Escape Plan , Every Time I Die , Bleeding Through , and Haste the Day followed. The band next paid tribute to many of their influences — from Pantera to Queen to Pink Floyd — on the covers album The Anatomy Of , which surfaced in June 2006, before hitting the road on a subsequent headlining tour. That fall, Victory reissued The Silent Circus with an additional bonus DVD of material. In 2007, they went into the studio with producer Jamie King and recorded Colors , which was released that September through Victory Records and described as “new wave polka grunge” by the band. The Great Misdirect , the band’s fifth studio album, appeared two years later. Victory put out a Between the Buried and Me greatest-hits album in 2011, just weeks before the band released their first EP on Metal Blade, The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues , the first entry in a two-part concept album. The second part, The Parallax II: Future Sequence , followed in 2012. In 2013, they embarked on The Future Sequence Tour, where they played The Parallax II in full. BTBAM re-entered the studio in late 2014 to begin work on a new concept recording — Metal Blade referred to it as a “rock opera.” Coma Ecliptic was produced by Jamie King and mixed by Jens Bogren . The set’s pre-release single, “Memory Palace,” appeared in April of 2015; the album followed in July. In 2017 the band released the concert LP Coma Ecliptic Live , which featured the band playing the album live in its entirety at The Observatory North Park in San Diego, California. Posted on January 16, 2018 February 14, 2018 Badfish – a Tribute to Sublime Head High Tour Encompassing the sense of place and purpose long associated with Sublime’s music, Badfish continues to channel the spirit of Sublime with a fury not felt for some time. What separates Badfish from other tribute bands is that they have replicated Sublime’s essence, developing a scene and dedicated following most commonly reserved for label-driven, mainstream acts. Badfish make their mark on the audience by playing with the spirit of Sublime . They perform not as Sublime would have, or did, but as Badfish does.

Posted on February 13, 2018 April 30, 2018 Sum 41 with Seaway & Super Whatevr Doors: 6:30PM Sum 41 will be performing their FULL record, Does This Look Infected?, to celebrate its 15th Anniversary! Sum 41 hit worldwide radar in 1996 after tiny Ajax, Ontario proved unable to fully contain the foursome’s mixture of punk-pop riffing, hip-hop poses, and toilet-bowl humor. Led by guitarist/vocalist Deryck Whibley, the band also included guitarist/vocalist Dave Baksh, bassist Cone McCaslin, and drummer Steve Jocz. Wooed by the boys’ goofy antics and incendiary live show (and excited about the prospect of promoting their very own blink-182), Island put Sum 41 on the payroll in 1999. The Half Hour of Power EP followed, and Warped Tour dates got the word out. They returned in 2000 with the fun-filled full-length All Killer No Filler, and the singles “In Too Deep” and “Fat Lip” became staples of both modern rock radio and TRL. An extensive tour followed, and Sum 41 enjoyed their success the way all near-teenage boys would, with plenty of towel-snapping, groupie-loving, and self-deprecating, low-ball humor. In 2002, they returned to wax with Does This Look Infected? While the album was a bit harder-edged, it found the band just as jazzed as ever to mix punk-pop business with sophomoric pleasure: the video for “Hell Song” featured the fellas acting out a sort of rock star debauchery cage match with the aid of a few celebrity action figures. Metallica, Jesus Christ, and the Osbournes all made appearances in the hilarious clip. It was not all fun and games, however, as their involvement in the charity group War Child Canada had Sum 41 lending a hand in the making of a 2004 documentary covering the effects of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five days into filming, fighting and gunfire suddenly erupted around them, and they barely escaped unharmed — these events led to 2004’s slightly more mature and serious effort, Chuck, named for the UN aid worker, Chuck Pelletier, who was instrumental in getting them to safety. The DVD Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo was released at the end of 2005 and the live album Go Chuck Yourself appeared the following March. Guitarist Dave Baksh left the band during the spring of 2006 due to creative differences, going on to form the metal-punk outfit Brown Brigade. Sum 41 continued on as a trio, and their first album as such, Underclass Hero, appeared in July 2007. The band eventually returned to being a quartet, replacing Baksh with guitarist Tom Thacker, and began to work on a new album. That new album, entitled Screaming Bloody Murder, appeared in March of 2011. “Blood in My Eyes,” a single from the album, was nominated for a Grammy that year. However, due to a series of back injuries for Whibley, Sum 41 would not return with new material for half a decade, despite their critical success. During the break, Jocz left the band and was replaced by Street Drum Corps’ Frank Zummo. Baksh also returned to the fold, just in time for Sum 41’s comeback in 2016. The group signed with Hopeless Records. Their sixth LP, 13 Voices, featured the lead single “Fake My Own Death.” While promoting the album, Whibley revealed that he was in an alcohol-related induced coma in 2014. While recovery included learning to walk and play guitar again, Whibley contributed a large part of his healing to the writing process of 13 Voices. To coincide with the album release, the band embarked on an international tour dubbed “Don’t Call It a Sum-Back.” Posted on February 13, 2018 April 30, 2018 The Wonder Years with Tigers Jaw, Tiny Moving Parts, and Worriers Doors: 7PM Taking its name from the TV show The Wonder Years, the Philadelphia punk pop band was formed by guitarists Matt Brasch and Casey Cavaliere, vocalist Dan “Soupy” Campbell, bassist Josh Martin, drummer Mike Kennedy, and keyboardist Mikey Kelly. The sextet got its start in 2005 when previous combo the Premier split up. Regrouping under the new name, the band began playing shows and released two split singles that year (with Bangarang! and Emergency and I). In late 2007, the Wonder Years self-released an album, the emphatically titled Get Stoked on It!, and quickly caught the eye of California label No Sleep, which signed the band. Their first record for the label was the EP Won’t Be Pathetic Forever, which came out in June of 2008. Following a split single with All or Nothing, Kelly left the band. After a year spent recording its second album, the group released The Upsides in January of 2010. The record made a dent in the lower regions of the Billboard charts, and gained the Wonder Years a deal with the larger indie Hopeless, which reissued the album in September with four bonus tracks. In the time between releases, drummer Kennedy quit the band and was replaced by Nick Steinborn. Kennedy soon returned to the fold and Steinborn bounced over to play keys and guitar. With the lineup solidified, the Wonder Years got to work on their next album with producer Steve Evetts. In 2011, they released their third album, Suburbia I’ve Given You All and Now I’m Nothing, followed by the arrival of a B-sides compilation, Sleeping on Trash, as well as their fourth full-length album, The Greatest Generation, in 2013. The following year, lead singer Campbell released his first album with his solo project Aaron West & the Roaring Twenties, We Don’t Have Each Other, with Campbell adopting the persona of Aaron West in his songs. After Campbell returned from a tour with the Roaring Twenties, he began working on songs for the next Wonder Years project, but suffered a powerful case of writer’s block that triggered a severe bout with depression. Campbell eventually channeled the emotions stirred up by his struggles into the group’s fifth studio album, 2015’s No Closer to Heaven, a concept piece about coming to terms with the death of a loved one. The Wonder Years’ next release, 2017’s Burst & Decay EP, offered acoustic versions of songs from their three previous LPs. The group re-entered the studio later that year with producers Joe Chiccarelli and Carlos de la Garza to record their sixth album. The resulting Sister Cities was released in 2018 and saw them shifting their sound away from their pop-punk roots. Posted on February 13, 2018 March 12, 2018 DESCENDENTS Doors: 7PM Show: 8PM Support: Radkey, Rehasher Fueled by “rejection, food, coffee, girls, fishing and food,” the Descendents sprang up during the halcyon days of the Los Angeles punk scene; fusing the blind rage of hardcore with an unexpectedly wry, self-deprecating wit and a strong melodic sensibility that set them distinctly apart from their West Coast brethren. They gradually emerged as one of the most enduring and adored bands of their time. Formed in 1979, the Descendents initially sported an edgy power pop sound inspired by the Buzzcocks . Through ups nad downs and intermittent disbanding and rebanding, the Descendents returned in 2016 with Hypercaffium Spazzinate , their first new studio material in 12 years. The album delivers all those good Descendents feelings their fans love. “Each time we make a record it’s almost like the first time all over again,” says drummer Bill Stevenson . Posted on February 1, 2018 Saved By The 90’s The ultimate 90’s party! With a high-energy live band that performs from a list of hundreds of 90s songs, and a DJ who can spin before, after, and in between sets, Saved by the 90s is the world’s best and longest-running 90s party and they’re here to rock your world. Posted on January 18, 2018 March 24, 2018 Between The Buried And Me w/ The Dear Hunter Between the Buried and Me is a thinking man’s hardcore unit hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina. The band began in 2000 after the dissolution of vocalist Tommy Rogers and guitarist Paul Waggoner ‘s previous group, Prayer for Cleansing . Rogers and Waggoner completed their new lineup with the addition of guitarist Nick Fletcher , bassist Jason King (ex- Azazel ), and drummer Mark Castillo , formerly of Bury Your Dead . An eponymous debut soon appeared, issued through the German indie Lifeforce, and the band supported its release with an avid tour schedule. Between the Buried and Me signed with Chicago hardcore powerhouse Victory in the summer of 2002 and began work on their debut for the label. The Silent Circus appeared in late October of the following year and showcased a more focused fusion of the group’s math rock, heavy metal, and post-hardcore influences. Several lineup changes ensued that saw Rogers and Waggoner rounded out by guitarist Dusty Waring, bassist Dan Briggs , and drummer Blake Richardson . Joining forces with producer Jamie King , who had recorded their self-titled effort, Between the Buried and Me released Alaska in September 2005. Various tour dates with the Dillinger Escape Plan , Every Time I Die , Bleeding Through , and Haste the Day followed. The band next paid tribute to many of their influences — from Pantera to Queen to Pink Floyd — on the covers album The Anatomy Of , which surfaced in June 2006, before hitting the road on a subsequent headlining tour. That fall, Victory reissued The Silent Circus with an additional bonus DVD of material. In 2007, they went into the studio with producer Jamie King and recorded Colors , which was released that September through Victory Records and described as “new wave polka grunge” by the band. The Great Misdirect , the band’s fifth studio album, appeared two years later. Victory put out a Between the Buried and Me greatest-hits album in 2011, just weeks before the band released their first EP on Metal Blade, The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues , the first entry in a two-part concept album. The second part, The Parallax II: Future Sequence , followed in 2012. In 2013, they embarked on The Future Sequence Tour, where they played The Parallax II in full. BTBAM re-entered the studio in late 2014 to begin work on a new concept recording — Metal Blade referred to it as a “rock opera.” Coma Ecliptic was produced by Jamie King and mixed by Jens Bogren . The set’s pre-release single, “Memory Palace,” appeared in April of 2015; the album followed in July. In 2017 the band released the concert LP Coma Ecliptic Live , which featured the band playing the album live in its entirety at The Observatory North Park in San Diego, California. Posted on January 16, 2018 February 14, 2018 Badfish – a Tribute to Sublime Head High Tour Encompassing the sense of place and purpose long associated with Sublime’s music, Badfish continues to channel the spirit of Sublime with a fury not felt for some time. What separates Badfish from other tribute bands is that they have replicated Sublime’s essence, developing a scene and dedicated following most commonly reserved for label-driven, mainstream acts. Badfish make their mark on the audience by playing with the spirit of Sublime . They perform not as Sublime would have, or did, but as Badfish does. Posted on January 9, 2018 March 9, 2018 Little Dragon Little Dragon will take their infectious electro-pop back on the road this spring. The Grammy-nominated band has announced a run of U.S. tour dates for March 2018, routing through the West and Gulf coasts. Tickets are on sale this Friday, January 12 at 10:00 AM Local Time at LittleDragon.net and all dates are listed below. Little Dragon released Season High on Loma Vista last year, which Brooklyn Vegan called “ continued proof of how timeless this band can be .” From the album came irresistibly smooth singles “High,” which Pigeons and Planes included in their Best Songs of 2017 , and “Sweet.” View the mesmerizing music videos for both tracks below. This group has never felt compelled to induce whiplash; in fact, their willingness to lay back and luxuriate presaged a wave of reflective, unhurried pop that remains trendy today. – Rolling Stone “Season High, Little Dragon’s latest triumph, is continued proof of how timeless this band can be.” – Brooklyn Vegan “Like its predecessors, their fifth full-length Season High purposefully avoids marquee guests and wild stylistic leaps in favor of cautiously controlled, luxury mood music.” – Pitchfork “With an evolved new collection of tracks that are both hot and smart, Little Dragon has set themselves further apart.” – Under The Radar “Season High i s typical Little Dragon fare, and we mean that in the best way possible. This is perfect pre-summer music.” – Pigeons & Planes “Throwback synths welcome in the warm slice of alternative R&B, a track full of smooth, subtle low-end and snapping percussion. “High” is equal parts meditative and sensual…” – Consequence of Sound “Season High moves from slinky Prince pastiche to body-jacking house music, and it takes all of them with a smooth sense of assurance.” – Stereogum “This paean to loose trips and close touches is a reliable soundtrack to a narcotized Valentine’s Day in with a main squeeze.” – NPR “beautiful dream-pop vocals from lead singer Yukimi Nagano, layered over slow-dance- appropriate electronic beats” – Paste Magazine “Here’s your new, woozy bedroom anthem. Press play and vibe out. This is music therapy at its most alleviating.” – NYLON Posted on December 15, 2017 January 24, 2018 SPOON w/ Sneaks TICKETS ON SALE NOW!!!

Posted on February 13, 2018 April 30, 2018 Sum 41 with Seaway & Super Whatevr Doors: 6:30PM Sum 41 will be performing their FULL record, Does This Look Infected?, to celebrate its 15th Anniversary! Sum 41 hit worldwide radar in 1996 after tiny Ajax, Ontario proved unable to fully contain the foursome’s mixture of punk-pop riffing, hip-hop poses, and toilet-bowl humor. Led by guitarist/vocalist Deryck Whibley, the band also included guitarist/vocalist Dave Baksh, bassist Cone McCaslin, and drummer Steve Jocz. Wooed by the boys’ goofy antics and incendiary live show (and excited about the prospect of promoting their very own blink-182), Island put Sum 41 on the payroll in 1999. The Half Hour of Power EP followed, and Warped Tour dates got the word out. They returned in 2000 with the fun-filled full-length All Killer No Filler, and the singles “In Too Deep” and “Fat Lip” became staples of both modern rock radio and TRL. An extensive tour followed, and Sum 41 enjoyed their success the way all near-teenage boys would, with plenty of towel-snapping, groupie-loving, and self-deprecating, low-ball humor. In 2002, they returned to wax with Does This Look Infected? While the album was a bit harder-edged, it found the band just as jazzed as ever to mix punk-pop business with sophomoric pleasure: the video for “Hell Song” featured the fellas acting out a sort of rock star debauchery cage match with the aid of a few celebrity action figures. Metallica, Jesus Christ, and the Osbournes all made appearances in the hilarious clip. It was not all fun and games, however, as their involvement in the charity group War Child Canada had Sum 41 lending a hand in the making of a 2004 documentary covering the effects of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five days into filming, fighting and gunfire suddenly erupted around them, and they barely escaped unharmed — these events led to 2004’s slightly more mature and serious effort, Chuck, named for the UN aid worker, Chuck Pelletier, who was instrumental in getting them to safety. The DVD Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo was released at the end of 2005 and the live album Go Chuck Yourself appeared the following March. Guitarist Dave Baksh left the band during the spring of 2006 due to creative differences, going on to form the metal-punk outfit Brown Brigade. Sum 41 continued on as a trio, and their first album as such, Underclass Hero, appeared in July 2007. The band eventually returned to being a quartet, replacing Baksh with guitarist Tom Thacker, and began to work on a new album. That new album, entitled Screaming Bloody Murder, appeared in March of 2011. “Blood in My Eyes,” a single from the album, was nominated for a Grammy that year. However, due to a series of back injuries for Whibley, Sum 41 would not return with new material for half a decade, despite their critical success. During the break, Jocz left the band and was replaced by Street Drum Corps’ Frank Zummo. Baksh also returned to the fold, just in time for Sum 41’s comeback in 2016. The group signed with Hopeless Records. Their sixth LP, 13 Voices, featured the lead single “Fake My Own Death.” While promoting the album, Whibley revealed that he was in an alcohol-related induced coma in 2014. While recovery included learning to walk and play guitar again, Whibley contributed a large part of his healing to the writing process of 13 Voices. To coincide with the album release, the band embarked on an international tour dubbed “Don’t Call It a Sum-Back.” Posted on February 13, 2018 April 30, 2018 The Wonder Years with Tigers Jaw, Tiny Moving Parts, and Worriers Doors: 7PM Taking its name from the TV show The Wonder Years, the Philadelphia punk pop band was formed by guitarists Matt Brasch and Casey Cavaliere, vocalist Dan “Soupy” Campbell, bassist Josh Martin, drummer Mike Kennedy, and keyboardist Mikey Kelly. The sextet got its start in 2005 when previous combo the Premier split up. Regrouping under the new name, the band began playing shows and released two split singles that year (with Bangarang! and Emergency and I). In late 2007, the Wonder Years self-released an album, the emphatically titled Get Stoked on It!, and quickly caught the eye of California label No Sleep, which signed the band. Their first record for the label was the EP Won’t Be Pathetic Forever, which came out in June of 2008. Following a split single with All or Nothing, Kelly left the band. After a year spent recording its second album, the group released The Upsides in January of 2010. The record made a dent in the lower regions of the Billboard charts, and gained the Wonder Years a deal with the larger indie Hopeless, which reissued the album in September with four bonus tracks. In the time between releases, drummer Kennedy quit the band and was replaced by Nick Steinborn. Kennedy soon returned to the fold and Steinborn bounced over to play keys and guitar. With the lineup solidified, the Wonder Years got to work on their next album with producer Steve Evetts. In 2011, they released their third album, Suburbia I’ve Given You All and Now I’m Nothing, followed by the arrival of a B-sides compilation, Sleeping on Trash, as well as their fourth full-length album, The Greatest Generation, in 2013. The following year, lead singer Campbell released his first album with his solo project Aaron West & the Roaring Twenties, We Don’t Have Each Other, with Campbell adopting the persona of Aaron West in his songs. After Campbell returned from a tour with the Roaring Twenties, he began working on songs for the next Wonder Years project, but suffered a powerful case of writer’s block that triggered a severe bout with depression. Campbell eventually channeled the emotions stirred up by his struggles into the group’s fifth studio album, 2015’s No Closer to Heaven, a concept piece about coming to terms with the death of a loved one. The Wonder Years’ next release, 2017’s Burst & Decay EP, offered acoustic versions of songs from their three previous LPs. The group re-entered the studio later that year with producers Joe Chiccarelli and Carlos de la Garza to record their sixth album. The resulting Sister Cities was released in 2018 and saw them shifting their sound away from their pop-punk roots. Posted on February 13, 2018 March 12, 2018 DESCENDENTS Doors: 7PM Show: 8PM Support: Radkey, Rehasher Fueled by “rejection, food, coffee, girls, fishing and food,” the Descendents sprang up during the halcyon days of the Los Angeles punk scene; fusing the blind rage of hardcore with an unexpectedly wry, self-deprecating wit and a strong melodic sensibility that set them distinctly apart from their West Coast brethren. They gradually emerged as one of the most enduring and adored bands of their time. Formed in 1979, the Descendents initially sported an edgy power pop sound inspired by the Buzzcocks . Through ups nad downs and intermittent disbanding and rebanding, the Descendents returned in 2016 with Hypercaffium Spazzinate , their first new studio material in 12 years. The album delivers all those good Descendents feelings their fans love. “Each time we make a record it’s almost like the first time all over again,” says drummer Bill Stevenson .

Posted on January 18, 2018 March 24, 2018 Between The Buried And Me w/ The Dear Hunter Between the Buried and Me is a thinking man’s hardcore unit hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina. The band began in 2000 after the dissolution of vocalist Tommy Rogers and guitarist Paul Waggoner ‘s previous group, Prayer for Cleansing . Rogers and Waggoner completed their new lineup with the addition of guitarist Nick Fletcher , bassist Jason King (ex- Azazel ), and drummer Mark Castillo , formerly of Bury Your Dead . An eponymous debut soon appeared, issued through the German indie Lifeforce, and the band supported its release with an avid tour schedule. Between the Buried and Me signed with Chicago hardcore powerhouse Victory in the summer of 2002 and began work on their debut for the label. The Silent Circus appeared in late October of the following year and showcased a more focused fusion of the group’s math rock, heavy metal, and post-hardcore influences. Several lineup changes ensued that saw Rogers and Waggoner rounded out by guitarist Dusty Waring, bassist Dan Briggs , and drummer Blake Richardson . Joining forces with producer Jamie King , who had recorded their self-titled effort, Between the Buried and Me released Alaska in September 2005. Various tour dates with the Dillinger Escape Plan , Every Time I Die , Bleeding Through , and Haste the Day followed. The band next paid tribute to many of their influences — from Pantera to Queen to Pink Floyd — on the covers album The Anatomy Of , which surfaced in June 2006, before hitting the road on a subsequent headlining tour. That fall, Victory reissued The Silent Circus with an additional bonus DVD of material. In 2007, they went into the studio with producer Jamie King and recorded Colors , which was released that September through Victory Records and described as “new wave polka grunge” by the band. The Great Misdirect , the band’s fifth studio album, appeared two years later. Victory put out a Between the Buried and Me greatest-hits album in 2011, just weeks before the band released their first EP on Metal Blade, The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues , the first entry in a two-part concept album. The second part, The Parallax II: Future Sequence , followed in 2012. In 2013, they embarked on The Future Sequence Tour, where they played The Parallax II in full. BTBAM re-entered the studio in late 2014 to begin work on a new concept recording — Metal Blade referred to it as a “rock opera.” Coma Ecliptic was produced by Jamie King and mixed by Jens Bogren . The set’s pre-release single, “Memory Palace,” appeared in April of 2015; the album followed in July. In 2017 the band released the concert LP Coma Ecliptic Live , which featured the band playing the album live in its entirety at The Observatory North Park in San Diego, California. Posted on January 16, 2018 February 14, 2018 Badfish – a Tribute to Sublime Head High Tour Encompassing the sense of place and purpose long associated with Sublime’s music, Badfish continues to channel the spirit of Sublime with a fury not felt for some time. What separates Badfish from other tribute bands is that they have replicated Sublime’s essence, developing a scene and dedicated following most commonly reserved for label-driven, mainstream acts. Badfish make their mark on the audience by playing with the spirit of Sublime . They perform not as Sublime would have, or did, but as Badfish does.
