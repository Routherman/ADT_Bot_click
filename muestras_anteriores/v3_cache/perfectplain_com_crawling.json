However, her background of working at her parents’ restaurants primed her to change that — a vision that she would stop at nothing to bring to life. Even so, her path to entrepreneurship faced countless rejections by landlords and banks, inspiring Tiffany to then shift her strategy entirely. In February of 2014, the bold idea of redesigning her vision into a food truck struck her, and in three short months, the truck was open for business. With persistent perseverance, Tiffany and her team overcame a challenging first season, which was soon rewarded with tremendous growth. And by leveraging that success, Green + The Grain opened its very first retail location in 2015. With that purpose-driven payoff, Tiffany went on to open six more locations with her passionate team by her side. Today, the woman- and minority-led business continues to thoughtfully evolve its premium collection of metropolitan locations throughout the U.S. With its proud family of dedicated staff and franchisees, Green + The Grain looks forward to its journey of becoming the premier salad destination. Our Mission We’re passionate about what we do and how we do it. Our mission is simple — redefine the fast casual salad experience and deliver the most exceptional, flavor forward salads crafted with the most premium quality ingredients, served in a clean aesthetic with a contemporary vibe that is unlike any other.

Be the first on your block to grow your own. #Plants & Crops by Brian Barth · August 31, 2015 Fruits, herbs, and vegetables get all the attention among gardeners. Backyard poultry and goats provide eggs and dairy (and perhaps meat) for some, but what about the staple foods? Wheat, oats, millet, and other grains are actually much easier to grow than most fruits and vegetables, yet we tend to leave those foods to large farms and buy our flour and cornmeal at the grocery store. There is a bit of specialized knowledge needed to grow grains, but there are a couple myths that have turned people off from the idea. The first is is that you need acres and acres to produce even a few pounds of flour. The truth is that 1,000 square feet – the size of an average backyard – is enough space to grow a bushel of wheat. A bushel of wheat equals 60 pounds of grain, which is enough to bake 90 loaves of bread. Even devoting a row in your vegetable garden to a grain will yield enough to make it worthwhile. The second myth is that you need special equipment to harvest grains and turn them into something you want to eat. Not so. Traditionally grains are harvested with a scythe, but you can also cut the stalks down with pair of pruning shears or a hedge trimmer. Threshing – removing the grain from the seedheads – is as simple as beating the stalks with a stick. Winnowing – removing the chaff (the papery covering around the grain) – is easily accomplished with a small household fan. A good quality blender passes as a mill for turning grains into flour. Wheat: Choose from winter or spring wheat varieties, depending on the planting season; ‘hard red’ wheat varieties are most commonly used for baking and are available in both cool- and warm-season cultivars Millet: Grows well in poor soil and matures in as little as 30 days; plant at any time in spring or summer Rye: Same growing requirements as winter wheat, but grows well in poor soil and is more cold-tolerant than wheat Spelt: A cool weather grain similar to wheat; tolerates poor soil and dry conditions Oats: In the South, plant in fall for a spring harvest; in cold climates, plant in early spring for a summer harvest; most oat varieties have a tough hull that takes extra effort to remove, so look for hull-less varieties, such as ‘Freedom’ Corn: Varieties for grinding into corn meal or corn flour are often referred to as Indian corn or field corn; like sweet corn, they need a long hot growing season and rich soil; no need for threshing or winnowing, just push the kernels off the cob by hand and store Barley: Plant in early spring for a late spring harvest or in fall for harvest the following spring; has a tough hull that makes home processing difficult Buckwheat: A warm weather grain that grows well in poor soil and matures in just 75 days Rice: There is no need to have a flooded rice paddy, but the soil needs to be kept constantly moist; otherwise, rice grows in the same manner as most other grains, but it does have a tough hull. Grains are divided between those that like to grow in warm weather and those that prefer cool temperatures. The majority fall in the latter group, which includes oats, rye, spelt, and most types of wheat. These are typically planted in early fall and are harvested in late spring the following year. (They overwinter under the snow in cold climates.) Buckwheat, millet, and certain wheat varieties need hot weather to mature and are planted in spring. Some feed stores sell grain seed suitable for kitchen use, but it’s often easier to find it online. We recommend Johnny’s Selected Seeds , Sustainable Seed Company , and Peaceful Valley Farm Supply . All grains need a sunny location. Till up the area to be planted to a depth of at least 6 inches. Most grains have low fertility requirements, but if the soil is extremely poor, spread a couple inches of compost over the surface and till it in before planting. In order to distribute the grain seed evenly over the surface of the soil, it’s best to use a seed spreader to sow the seed, rather than try to distribute it by hand. Follow the instructions on the package for the appropriate seeding rate – this will usually be given in pounds per 1,000 square feet. After spreading the seed, lightly rake the area with a hard metal rake to mix it into the surface layer of soil. Spread a thin layer of straw over the soil to deter birds from feasting on the seed and to conserve soil moisture. Soak the area with a sprinkler to encourage germination and continue to keep the area moist (but not soggy) until the seedlings have emerged. When planting in the fall, cool weather may preclude the need for additional irrigation. Spring plantings will need about an inch of water per week. If in doubt, water whenever the top inch of soil is dry. Some warm-season grains mature in as little as 30 days after germination, while grains that are overwintered may need up to nine months before they are ready to harvest. Here are the basic steps to bring your crop from the field to the pantry. Harvest the grains when the stalks are just beginning to go from green to brown, using a scythe or other tool. Cut them just above the ground. Tie the stalks into bunches with twine and let them dry for about two weeks in a location that is protected from rain. They may be left to dry on the floor or hung from the ceiling of a barn or porch. You’ll know the grain is sufficiently dry if it’s hard and crunchy when you bite into it. Spread a tarp or sheet over the floor, and beat the stalks with a wooden dowel to release the grain from the seedheads. (This is called threshing.) Collect the grain in a large bowl or bucket. Set up a fan at a medium speed (strong enough to blow away the chaff, but not so strong to blow away the grain. This isn’t terribly difficult since the chaff – the papery covering around the grain – is much lighter than the grain.) Drop handfuls of the grain into a second container, allowing the breeze to blow off the chaff as they fall. (This is called winnowing.) Store the cleaned grain in glass jars in a cool dark place. Mill the grain as needed with heavy duty blender ( like a Vitamix ) or a countertop grain mill . One extra step is required before some grains can be milled, which is to remove the hull. Rice, buckwheat, and oats are examples of grains with a hard outer hull. One method, which is a bit tedious for large quantities, is to run the grain lightly through a blender to crack the hulls and separate them from the grain. You can then sift the hulls out with your fingers or find the right size metal mesh that allows the grain to fall through, but removes the hulls. Fortunately, most grain mills are capable of removing the hulls and some even come with a special attachment for the purpose.

I’d love to read more from them about heritage or heirloom grain growing as well. 36 Reply View Replies (1) janelle 5 years ago This is great. I live in SW ohio and have raised beds as well as spaces for ground plantings. I was thinking about using winter rye as a covering until next spring but would like to harvest and use the grain if possible. This may sound dumb but is winter rye useable as a grain to make bread? I have a back to eden garden… will the wood chips be a hinderance? Thanks! 22 Reply View Replies (1) Katie 6 years ago I’m looking for a reputable place to buy these kinds of seeds from.

      "text": "Garden & Grain outdoor cocktail lounge now open behind Perfect Plain News Sports Play Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals LOCAL Garden & Grain outdoor cocktail lounge now open behind Perfect Plain Jake Newby Pensacola News Journal In a sense, Perfect Plain Brewing Co. has started over with the integration of its new outdoor courtyard and cocktail lounge. Brewery owner DC Reeves and his staff have spent a year fine-tuning the identity of the 2,500-square-foot backyard sanctum known as Garden & Grain, which officially opened Thursday at 50 E. Garden St. \"It's really like starting over in a good way, I think anybody expanding or renovating or constructing can relate to the fact that things take a little bit longer than you like and things run more expensive than you'd like, but when you're at this point, this is kind of where the fun begins,\" Reeves said Thursday, a few feet away from the courtyard's 720-foot, pastel-colored mural depicting a bird hovering amid a flower garden. Garden & Grain's origin story: Perfect Plain's Garden & Grain cocktail courtyard opening in Pensacola this summer \"We're done, it's turned out probably more beautiful than we hoped,\" he added. \"And we're just super excited to show this off.\" What does the Garden & Grain menu look like? The initial cocktail menu for Perfect Plain's new outdoor extension is broken up into two primary sections — signatures and classics. Garden & Grain front man, mixologist Nate Simmons, said the signature menu was designed with the summertime in mind. Here are the five cocktails guests can imbibe: Company of Wolves, $8.50 : Paranubes Mexican Rum, Rum Bar Rum, Giffard Banana, Lime, Nutmeg. 2 Birds of a Feather, $8 : Probitas White Rum, Rum Fire Jamaican Rum, Hibiscus Tea, Mint. Roots, $9 : Ilegal Mezcal, Tequila Ocho Blanco, Ancho Reyes Verde, Maize, Local Honey, Lime, Spiced Popped Corn. Dodging Raindrops, $8 : Fords Gin Reserve, Lemon Thyme, Prosecco Shrub, Bubble Water. 11 P.M. Flight, $9 : Derrumbes Mezcal, Aperol, Solerno Blood Orange Liqueur, Lemon, Sparkling Rosé. View in new tab The above drinks are seasonal, Simmons said, and will likely be replaced with an autumn selection of drinks toward the end of October or beginning of November. \"We wanted this first menu to be light and fun, lot of bubbles, tons of flavors, that sort of thing,\" Simmons said. \"So there's some of things we experimented with during our craft labs , but I also wanted to do some surprises as well.\" Garden & Grain's classics menu includes the new cocktail lounge's take on seven classics, like the mojito, the margarita and the daiquiri. There's also a Stolen Hurricane frozen drink, which is a combination of Stolen Smoked Rum, Rum Fire Jamaican, pineapple, passionfruit, strawberry, mango and lime stock for a price of $9. You can add Float Plantation Overproofed Dark Rum to it for $3 more. There's also wine, non-alcoholic tea and boozy popsicles on the brand new menu. When does Garden & Grain open and how many people does it seat? Between bar seating, deck-style seating and individual and double-seated patio furniture, Garden & Grain has a capacity of about 75-100. Garden & Grain is a literal, sustainable garden, bursting with muscadine grape vines — that will run up through an overhanging Treilles — citrus trees, olive trees, peach trees and much more. And the garden isn't solely for the sake of aesthetics. You might be brushing up against the plants one week and tasting them the next. \"Everything that we planted we want to reuse in beer and cocktails that we make,\" Reeves said. The hours of operation at Garden & Grain will be the same as Perfect Plain's hours, with the exception of Friday's opening time — the new cocktail lounge will open up at 3 p.m. Fridays. Immediately behind Garden & Grain is the 1,800-square-foot private event space known as the Grainhouse, which is also fully restored and renovated and has been accepting bookings since July. The third bar on the property is located inside the Grainhouse, separated from the courtyard by a garage door. That bar will be open from time to time on Fridays and Saturdays if the brewery is busy and the venue isn't being used. Reeves said a grand opening party for Garden & Grain should happen in October. Jake Newby can be reached at jnewby@pnj.com or 850-435-8538.

Located in the heart of Downtown Pensacola, our mission is to create incredible experiences that make our beer, our brewery, and our hometown, Pensacola, unforgettable. “Pensacola is a perfect plain. The land nearly as white as flour but productive of fine peaches, oranges in abundance, grapes, figs, pomegranates, etc. Fine flowers grow spontaneously, for they have neglected the gardens, expecting a change of government. The town is immediately on the bay-the most beautiful water prospect I ever saw; and from 10 o’clock in the morning until 10 at night we have the finest sea breeze. There is something in it so exhilarating, so pure, so wholesome, it enlivens the whole system.” Keep In Touch!
