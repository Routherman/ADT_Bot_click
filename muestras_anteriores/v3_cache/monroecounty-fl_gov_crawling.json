Opportunities may open up to move to competitive race meetings concentrating on junior riders and assisting them through to senior riders.  Further to this Richard Higgs, the initial founder / financer of the complex, put together a small group of ex-speedway riders and interested people who formed a club, Tasmanian Speedway Motorcycle Association , who have now moved to leasing the complex from Richard & Victoria Higgs with the goal to maintain Richard’s original ideas. Included in the complex to date is a licenced Junior track, still to be completed senior track (expected to be completed late 2024) There are meeting rooms, and an enclosed area that currently has a range of solo motorcycles and various speedway memorabilia stored within. On site is a fully equipped workshop, tractors and water truck for track maintenance. Facilities include portable toilets and a shower. Water tanks, pumps and other equipment required is also on site. Landscaping is an ongoing project across the site.

The budget includes the Board of County Commissioners, the constitutional officers, which includes the Sheriff, Tax Collector, Property Appraiser, Supervisor of Elections, and Clerk of Court, and other appropriations for the Tourist Development Council, capital projects, and reserves. Each entity has its own independent budget within the total budget. Monroe County Administrator Christine Hurley, Assistant Administrator Tina Boan, and Budget and Finance’s John Quinn presented the proposed budget, which includes FY26 estimates of residential real estate trends, taxable property values, decreasing sales and bed taxes, and state-shared revenues, along with fund balances, reserves, and the general fund conditions. At the meeting, the board approved additional budget reductions in the amount of $2 million, which includes removing additional vacant positions, withdrawing from the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact, discontinuing Conch Connect, and implementing other operating cost reductions. During the meeting, the board also approved an increase to the countywide millage rate to generate an additional $2 million for emergency reserves to add $4 million in additional emergency disaster reserves in the event of a hurricane or other disaster. This action occurred after the finalization of the FY26 recommended budget and budget book process, as presented. Due to this, the FY26 recommended budget includes corrections that will be updated for the first public budget hearing on Sept. 3, 2025. Key FY26 Budget Points Total FY26 Proposed Amended Budget of $680,571,447 which reflects a reduction of $34,142,738 from the FY25 Adopted Budget of $715,714,185 $13.6 million in county efficiency cuts resulting from budget roundtable meetings Raises the FY26 aggregate millage rate to 3.3965, 0.6% above the FY25 aggregate rate of 3.3779, likely to be the lowest in the state again. Investments in public safety: Compensation increases for EMS and law enforcement personnel to attract and retain a qualified workforce Construction of a new fire station on Sugarloaf Key Various maintenance and improvement projects to the Monroe County Detention Center Building emergency reserves by $4 million due to the uncertainty of FEMA participation in disaster recovery. This will increase reserves to $14 million, which hasn’t been increased since its original implementation in 2008. Measures to improve government efficiency, being guided by the State Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) through departmental consolidations and mergers, staff reductions, and cuts to non-core services. The budget continues to include $1.1 million for Human Services Advisory Board funding for local nonprofit organizations. With the proposed budget and countywide average property values, a homesteaded residential property owner with an average appraised taxable value of $516,750.46 will see a $5.30 monthly increase in their countywide property tax for FY26. Of the total taxable value in Monroe County, 19.4 percent is from homesteaded properties. Non-homesteaded residential properties comprise 59.8 percent of the total taxable value. A non-homesteaded property with a taxable value of $1,015,180.32 would see a $24.08 per month increase in countywide property tax. Commercial property and vacant land represent 17.3 percent and 3.5 percent of the total taxable value, respectively. Of the total budget, $168.7 million is ad valorem (or from property taxes), 69.7 percent of the ad valorem is for public safety (like law enforcement, fire rescue, detention centers, medical examiner, and the health department), and 21.7 percent is for the constitutional officers’ operating costs. FY26 Budget Timeline The First Public Hearing of the adoption of the tentative budget and millage rate will be Wednesday, Sept. 3 at 5:05 p.m. at the Harvey Government Center in Key West. The Final Public Hearing will be held on Wednesday, Sept. 10 at 5:05 p.m. at the Murray Nelson Government Center in Key Largo. The BOCC adopts the final millage rate and budget at this meeting. Both meetings are hybrid and can be attended in person or via Zoom. The Monroe County Office of Budget and Finance will continue to monitor economic and policy developments throughout the summer and remain prepared to respond as circumstances evolve. Fiscal Year 2025 Budget FY25 Adopted Budget Summary FY25 Adopted Annual Operating and Capital Budget Book The Monroe County Board of County Commissioners met in September 2024 to discuss, approve, and finalize the $715.7 million Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) budget. The budget includes the Board of County Commissioners, the constitutional officers, which include the Sheriff, Tax Collector, Property Appraiser, Supervisor of Elections, and Clerk of Court, and other appropriations for the Tourist Development Council, capital projects, and reserves. Each entity has its own independent budget within the total budget. Monroe County Office of Management and Budget Director Tina Boan presented the budget with FY25 estimates of residential real estate trends, taxable property values, sales taxes, and state shared revenues, along with fund balance, reserves, and general fund. With the finalized budget and countywide average property values, a homesteaded residential property owner with an average appraised taxable value of $500,777.90 will see a $2.54 monthly increase for countywide services in their property tax for the FY25 year. Of the total taxable value in Monroe County, 20 percent is from homesteaded properties. Non-homesteaded residential properties (with an average taxable value of $922,891.20) comprise 59 percent of the taxable value. Non-homesteaded properties would see a $17 per month increase. Commercial property and vacant land represent 17 percent and 4 percent of taxable value, respectively. Of the total budget, $156 million is ad valorem (or from property taxes), 70.8 percent of the ad valorem funds public safety (like law enforcement, fire rescue, detention centers, medical examiner, and the health department), and 22.2 percent funds the constitutional officers’ operating costs. “The total ad valorem tax levy funds everything it takes to run this county from personnel, police, fire rescue, electric in county buildings, parks and beach improvements, children, senior and Veterans services, trash collection, and more,” said Assistant County Administrator Kevin Wilson. “The rest of the budget is funded by sales tax, state shared revenues, license and permit fees, fines and forfeitures, and service charges.” Additional FY25 Budget Key Points: Countywide millage rate: 2.6929 or $269.29 per $100,000 of value, most likely the lowest in Florida again. This is 1% below the FY24 rate of 2.7191. The FY25 aggregate millage rate is 3.3779, which is 0.8% lower than the FY24 rate. Reflects a property value increase with a total taxable value of $46.2 billion, another historical high. Property values have doubled in the past 8 years, a 10.6 percent increase compared to last year. Reflects continued investment in roads and bridges, resilience adaptation, facilities, and public safety, including funding for the three new Trauma Star helicopters (spread out over several years), operational costs of the new Emergency Operations Center, funding for 24 firefighters who have been paid through a Safer Grant for the past three years, a new Sugarloaf Fire Station, and a replacement firetruck, ambulance, and the addition of two new fire rescue boats. Sixteen notable capital projects with $110 million in total costs have $66 million in grant funding, a testament to staff success in finding grants (OPM) to fund local projects and shows a balanced approach to fostering resilience in Monroe County. Funds higher operational costs, such as increases for vendor contracts, fuel, supplies, and materials costs, utility and property insurance costs, and personnel costs, while committing to keeping property taxes low. Provides more than $2.2 million in funding for 30 community-based nonprofit organizations. 12 full-time vacant staff positions were eliminated from the budget, a savings of $1.3 million.

ABOUT US We're BRANDKETING NERDS on a mission: bringing brands to life. To us, brands aren't just logos; they're living entities. Our forte lies in crafting tailor-made BRANDKETING solutions that seamlessly weave together all facets of your brand, whether making waves online or leaving an indelible mark offline. ​ Our journey began over six years back in the realm of signage. Back then, our founder keenly observed many clients' struggles in connecting with their audience, maintaining consistency, and propelling their businesses forward. That pivotal moment led to the birth of RP Branding Studio, where we introduced our unique blend of BRANDKETING solutions. ​ Admittedly, as time passed, our branding drifted from our core mission. Thus, we underwent an evolution, emerging as HIGGS HUB. The name draws inspiration from the awe-inspiring \"God particle,\" the Higgs boson, believed to have ignited the Big Bang that birthed our universe. 'Hub' signifies a central convergence point—a place where everything aligns. ​ In our pursuit of excellence, we embrace the truth that perfection is an elusive target. But that's never an excuse. We're committed to delivering our absolute best every single time. Enter our Creative Bing Bang—a journey that's both enjoyable and stress-free, fueled by teamwork, your involvement, creativity, open communication, and an abundance of coffee. ​ In our narrative, our clients are the heroes, and we are the guiding mentors in their quest for success. ​ If this resonates with you, we're here to stand by your side, offering guidance and support every step of the way. LET'S WORK TOGETHER > MEET THE FOUNDER Rosella Papale FOUNDER & CEO Rosella's journey traverses continents, from the vibrant streets of Caracas, Venezuela, to pursuing new horizons in the United States, driven by a quest for fresh opportunities. Stepping away from a thriving career as a Medical Doctor - an Anesthesiologist - in her homeland, she embarked on a life-altering path, embracing entrepreneurship in a foreign land, leaving behind cherished family, friends, and the familiar embrace of her profession. ​ Venturing into signage, printing, and graphics, Rosella's thirst for knowledge led her back to academia. Here, she acquired an MBA with a specialized focus in Marketing. Amidst this educational odyssey, a profound passion for the artistry of branding and marketing took root, igniting her professional spirit. ​ Rooted in Rosella's profound expertise across signage, printing, graphics, branding, and marketing, she recognized a shared hurdle among small businesses and entrepreneurs. This challenge involved establishing genuine connections with their audience, sustaining consistency, and nurturing organic, long-term growth. This pivotal revelation ignited the birth of HIGGS HUB (formerly RP Branding Studio), an innovative branding & marketing boutique propelled by Rosella's boundless creative passion and unwavering commitment to empowering others to bring their brands to life. ​ Not content with merely shaping her entrepreneurial path, Rosella is integral to various esteemed organizations. She actively contributes as a director on the Board of Directors at the Coral Gables Chamber of Commerce.

Higgs Memorial Beach park | Monroe County, FL - Official Website Skip to Main Content Search Departments Services / Programs Our Community Find It Fast Home Departments County Departments Project Management Current Major Capital Projects Higgs Beach Clarence S. Higgs Memorial Beach park County-owned Clarence S. Higgs Memorial Beach Park is located on the Atlantic Ocean in Key West and comprises approximately 16.5 acres of oceanfront vista. The park includes the 400-foot Reynolds Street Pier. From its clear turquoise waters to its beautiful sandy beaches and its tropical vegetation, Higgs Beach offers a Civil War Era Fort, Fort West Martello home of the Key West Garden Club that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a beachside café, the African Refugee Memorial and burial site, and an AIDS memorial. Activities available include swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing, beach volleyball, tennis, pickleball, and a children's playground. Higgs Beach Park also hosts the only shore-accessible underwater marine park in the United States and is the end of the Florida Overseas Heritage Trail, one of only 31 nationally designated All American Highways in the United States. A beach concessionaire offers beach items for rent including chairs, umbrellas, kayaks, and paddleboards, among others. The Key West Garden Club offers free self-guided tours at Fort West Martello of the almost two acres of beautiful gardens. The park hosts a large dog park with separate runs for small and large dogs. Park Improvements and Revitalization Master Plan The Monroe County Board of County Commissioners approved a Master Plan renovation for the Park in January 2012. (See plans below). The non-profit group, Friends of Higgs Beach, Architect Bill Horn, and county staff worked tirelessly on public input, surveys, and funding sources over the past six years to produce a plan that distinguishes the future of the park as a gem of the county. The objective of this Master Plan is to have an overall sense and organization for the Park’s long-term renovation. A couple of interesting facts in the Master Plan: An increase in green space and beach area A decrease of more than 1 acre of “paving” (road, parking, sidewalks) Less than 0.11 acres in new buildings A .12-acre decrease in existing building structures A .10-acre increase in amenities (pickleball courts, etc.) Phase I and II: Complete Beachside Playground, completed in 2012, and a ten-station Athletic Trail, thanks to the Friends of Higgs Beach, on the north side of the park was completed in 2016. Park Access Road Realignment This project was approved by the Board of County Commissioners as part of the 2014 capital improvements plan. It is being funded by the one-cent infrastructure tax. A company has been hired for professional services in the relocation of the Higgs Beach Park access roadway. In March 2015, the Board of County Commissioners voted to extend their services in order to address impacts to other park resources that will be affected by the roadway realignment including the existing racquetball court, the existing dog park, and connections to the West Martello Tower. The amendment will also provide for permitting and construction oversight of sand replenishment efforts on the beach. The sand replenishment is being funded through a Tourist Development (TDC) grant. The county staff is currently working with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the National Park Service to complete the final approvals necessary to begin construction.

Monitoring Frequency: Higgs Beach is sampled\n    Weekly from\n    January 1st \n    to\n    December 31st. Water Quality Graph: Pie Chart Bar Chart Interval: Yearly Quarterly Monthly About Higgs Beach The second largest beach in Key West running along Atlantic Boulevard, this wide sandy beach has much to offer. Restroom facilities, shaded picnic tables, full service restaurant and playground across the street. There is a rental facility on the beach that rents beach chairs, rafts and watersport rentals including snorkel equipment.  Walk to the end of the nearby pier and descend the concrete steps into the welcoming water and snorkel around the pier to see wonderful sea creatures in 3-4 foot water both on the wall and the ocean floor. Higgs Beach also has a dog park and a bicycle trail. The pier is also an excellent place for a sunset stroll. Current Weather 30°C Cloudy Source Information The Florida Department of Health (DOH) adopted new water quality criteria January 2016 for the Healthy Beaches program. They reflect the most current recommendations and water quality grant requirements in the 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria from the US Environmental Protection Agency. Monroe County beaches are monitored by the Florida Healthy Beaches Program. Monitoring results are collected bi-weekly on Tuesday and results are posted to the Florida Healthy beaches website on Thursday. Samples are collected year round, however the peak season is from March to November. Swim Guide checks for the latest information daily, Monday - Friday. \n\nThe Florida Healthy Beaches Program Categories are: \n\nGood = 0-35 Enterococci / 100 mL of marine water;\nModerate = 36-70 Enterococci / 100 mL of marine water, and;\nPoor = 71 or greater Enterococci / 100 mL of marine water. \n\nThe 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria recommends using 70 CFU per 100 mL as the Beach Action Value (BAV) to guide public health advisories. A Single Sample Maximum (SSM) at 70 CFU per 100 ml and a BAV are functionally the same. If the sample result is above the indicated value, the beach is resampled and tested the following day or a beach advisory is issued with the first test result. The Healthy Beaches program no longer uses geometric means to represent recreational water quality data.\n\nOn Swim Guide a beach is marked Green when it has a Good or Moderate standing meaning the SSM test results show Enterococci counts between 0- 70 cfu (colony forming units) / 100ml.\nSwim Guide marks a beach Red when it has a Poor standing. This means the SSM test results show Enterococci counts exceeds the BAV of 70 cfu/100ml. These conservative advisories better inform vulnerable people (children, elderly, and the immunocompromised) who have elevated health risks due to water quality at the beach.\nA beach is marked Grey when no current or reliable monitoring information is available.\n\nPlease note: Vibrio vulnificus bacteria, also called flesh eating disease, is a naturally occurring bacteria in some of Florida's waters. This bacteria can be lethal, especially when contracted by individuals with compromised immune systems. Concentrations of the bacteria are higher in the mouths of rivers near oceans. The bacteria is most dangerous when ingested in raw seafood but recent deaths are attributed to individuals who have waded in water with broken skin. Beach goers are urged to use caution and consult a physician if you suspect you have come in contact with the bacteria.

Current County zones include AE, VE, and X zones. New zones, like the Coastal AE zone, were added to the maps, and now include a boundary that shows a LiMWA zone, where waves can also be expected to impact the strength of structures. Per Florida Building Code, structures in a Coastal A zone are also required to be constructed strong enough to withstand wave action. The elevation and coastal boundary are used to determine where finished floors or structural elements must be constructed to withstand wave action during a flood. These maps are currently being reviewed by County staff and technical consultants before FEMA establishes new map boundaries. FLOOD INSURANCE REMINDER In January 2020, FEMA held Community meetings throughout the Keys, offering the public an opportunity to view and comment in person on the proposed PRELIMINARY Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Following this, Monroe County, through its Consultant, examined the maps and the accompanying Flood Insurance Studies provided by FEMA. COVID-19 impacted FEMA’s original timeline for Monroe County’s Map Review and Adoption Process. FEMA is now in the process of preparing a notice for advertisement in the Federal Register. Once the Federal Register notice is published, legal notices will be sent to local newspapers announcing the publication. The second legal notice in the newspapers will mark the beginning of a 90-day appeal and comment period. At this time, anyone wishing to comment or appeal the proposed maps may do so with FEMA, along with any documentation to support their case. Once FEMA reviews and processes all appeals, they will publish the final FIRMS. The final FIRMs will likely become effective sometime in 2021-2022. At this time, the county is required to formally adopt the maps by ordinance and for residents to be eligible for the National Flood Insurance Policy. The maps will be used when reviewing permits to establish finished floor elevation and determine building and site design requirements to reduce future risk of flooding. New lender requirements may go into effect along with flood insurance requirements, as well as changes in flood insurance rates as a result of map changes. All new FEMA mapping elevations will be done in a different datum (NAVD88). Staff will be available to assist the public in understanding how these proposed changes will impact each property owner. If you are eligible for flood insurance, the Board of County Commissioners urges homeowners to purchase a flood policy now even if you are self-insured or in an X Zone. Under today’s existing rules existing flood policies can be grandfathered in and can be assumed by future buyers. COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS) www.monroecounty-fl.gov/crs Unincorporated Monroe County is in the process to move from a CRS class 5 to a class 4 designation saving flood insurance policyholders hundreds of dollars yearly. The average annual savings per policyholder will go from $373/ year to $448 per year if the County is successful in this effort. The total County savings annually would go from $5,317202 to $6,376,373. Deductions are based upon the individual property premiums. Monroe County would be the only class 4 in a coastal community. There are only two other class 4 designated counties in Florida. Annually, brochures are sent to homeowners identifying flood risks. Email: floodmaps@monroecounty-fl. gov. The County entered the CRS program in 2017. Each year, this saves policyholders more than $5 million. Code Compliance www.monroecounty-fl.gov/codecompliance Code Compliance provides an equitable and effective method of enforcement of building, zoning, land development, environmental and other County codes to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Monroe County. The department establishes working partnerships with neighborhoods and outside agencies to assist with compliance. Code Compliance performs field inspections and investigates complaints relating to ordinance violations. • Prioritizes safety violations related to unsafe structures, work without permits, land clearing, sewer connections, and vacation rental violations based on elected official goals for compliance • Coordinates removal of abandoned vehicles/vessels, trash and debris, and maintenance of overgrown lots • Issues Courtesy Notices for less extreme violations and/or Notices of Violation, with emphasis placed on voluntary compliance, but if a property owner doesn’t respond, Code Compliance will proceed with enforcement measures to achieve compliance • Provides assistance and information to Special Magistrate and the public regarding Monroe County Code of Ordinances • Coordinates litigation efforts with the County Attorney’s Office • Provides collections of fines/liens related to violations • Coordinates with the real estate industry during the sale of property with violations or fines By the Numbers 1,195 Opened new cases in 2020 $2.3 M totaled collections of fines, costs, and after-the-fact fees.

The GIS Office is also an integral component of the new FEMA flood mapping plans. Email Davisson- Bryan@monroecounty-fl.gov. RATE OF GROWTH ORDINANCE (ROGO) In 2012, based on hurricane evacuation clearance time modeling and Monroe County’s status as an Area of Critical State Concern, the State of Florida mandated that no more than 1,970 new housing unit permits (ROGO permits) be issued within unincorporated Monroe County through the year 2023. Based on the evacuation modeling, this total number of housing units brings the Florida Keys up to its required maximum 24-hour evacuation clearance time. The incorporated municipalities within the Florida Keys also have limited ROGO permits to issue. In 2019, the Board of County Commissioners directed staff to process amendments to extend the timeframe for issuance of the remaining permits an additional three years, through 2026, in order to leave time to consider the next hurricane evacuation model, which is planned to occur following the 2020 US Census. Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan are currently in progress and will cut the rate of ROGO permit issuance in half for the remainder of the allocation period (July 2020 – July 2023). Results of the next hurricane evacuation clearance time modeling are expected in 2022. ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES conducts the review of applications for compliance with environmental regulations, such as habitat identification, landscaping, stormwater, land clearing, and FEMA required review of potential endangered species impacts under the Permit Referral Process.

The certified firefighters are cross-trained as paramedics, flight medics, emergency medical technicians (EMT’s), and Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting personnel (ARFF). Responsibilities include: • Fire suppression • Aircraft Emergency Response (ARFF) • Advanced emergency medical response and transportation (air and ground) • Fire prevention and safety education • All-hazards disaster preparedness • Countywide firefighting and EMS training In 2020, MCFR firefighters responded to emergency incidents throughout Monroe County. These calls for service included: structure fires, wildland fires, brush fires, trash fires, vehicle fires, marine/boat fires, gas leaks, water-related rescues, vehicle extrication calls, hazardous material spills, aircraft incidents, and medical emergency calls. In 2020, MCFR responded by ground ambulance and Trauma Star helicopters to 3,315 medical emergency calls. Of the 842 patients that were airlifted to out-of-county hospitals, about one third of the incidents were scene responses related to heart attacks, strokes, traffic accidents, and other trauma related incidents. The remaining helicopter transports were hospital-to-hospital transfers for medical emergencies, including heart attacks, strokes, seizures, difficulty breathing and abdominal disorders.

Tiger Dams In an effort to provide temporary relief from king tide flooding in October 2020, Monroe County Road Department crews installed 2,400 linear feet of Tiger Dam temporary barrier in the Twin Lakes and Stillwright Point neighborhoods. With assistance from the vendor, the Roads Department staff placed the barrier sections on the roadway shoulder and anchored them down; then they filled the sections with water to create a dam that prevented saltwater from flowing onto the roads. Since the barriers also prevented stormwater from draining off of the roads to adjacent areas crews were deployed to pump stormwater off of the roads after each rainstorm. The tiger dams were successful in stopping saltwater inundation of roads during the king tide and providing temporary relief to residents. The barriers were removed when flooding ceased and can be reused as needed in the future.
