For that ephemeral reason, we must take extra time to capture and record the moments that made us. Dive into Asolo Repertory Theatre’s history of creativity, community and innovation. A Brief History The Origin of “Asolo” The name “Asolo” comes to us from Asolo, Italy — a beautiful town tucked in the hills of the northern countryside. There, a lovely jewel-box theatre sat dismantled in storage until Everett “Chick” Austin, the first director of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, discovered it. By 1949, he had acquired the interior of what is now known as the Historic Asolo Theatre. The First Performances In 1952, the theatre was constituted as a gallery in Sarasota — but it didn’t collect dust. A fledgling acting company founded by the faculty of Florida State University (FSU) began performing there each summer, first as the Asolo Theatre Festival and later as the Asolo Theatre Company. With strong support from the community and growing demand for high-calibre theatre,  the Festival transitioned into a year-round operation. The Growth Period Asolo Rep became the first State Theatre of Florida (1965) and a founding member of the League of Resident Theatres (LORT) in 1966. Later, the company partnered with the FSU School of Theatre to mentor young actors — a relationship now known as the FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training. The Big Move The acting company and its audience eventually outgrew the Historic Asolo Theatre in Sarasota, Florida. As a result, Asolo Rep moved into the newly constructed FSU Center for the Performing Arts in December of 1989. Today, Asolo Rep shares bold stories across multiple stages — electrifying the Sarasota community with each production. The Decades in Detail Journey through more than 60 years of Asolo Repertory Theatre’s history. Though capturing every miraculous moment is impossible, we hope an in-depth account will convey our commitment to community transformation through the arts. The 60’s The 70’s The 80’s The 90’s The 2000’s The 2010’s The 2020’s 1959 Clifford Odets’ The Country Girl featured artists Richard G. Fallon, Howard J. Millman, Isa Thomas and Eberle Thomas. The play inspired attendees and Florida State University theatre faculty members, including Arthur Dorlag and Charles I. Reimer. 1960 Florida State University faculty founded a summer acting company, which performed in the Ringling Museum’s Historic Asolo Theatre in Sarasota, Florida. It soon became known as the Asolo Theatre Festival. The Festival gained recognition for its strong performers, historical authenticity and unique marriage of content and setting. 1962 The Festival’s repertory broadened to include works from all historic periods, including Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew and a late 19th-century play, Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac . Newly appointed as General Director, Richard G. Fallon set out to make the Festival a high-quality professional repertory company. 1964 A critic of international stature, Howard Hewes of The Saturday Review, boosted the Festival’s national profile by writing: “There are two theaters in North America worth the price of admission simply to enter and be seated… the Stratford, Ontario Festival Theatre and the Asolo.” 1965 Following designation from the state legislature, the Asolo Theatre made history by becoming the first State Theatre of Florida. With this honor and financial investment from the federal government to launch a touring company, the Festival looked to expand its operations. 1966 The Asolo Theatre Festival became a year-round operation and a member of the prestigious League of Resident Theatres (LORT), now known as the Asolo Theatre Company. The annual production output increased to at least eight shows in the Historic Asolo Theatre, as well as a few touring productions. Richard G. Fallon appointed Asolo veteran actor-directors Robert Strane and Eberle Thomas as Co-Artistic Directors. 1968 FSU began sending acting students to complete internships with the company. Howard J. Millman became the first Managing Director, a position he held until 1980. Millman returned to Asolo as Producing Artistic Director in 1995. The 60’s 1970 Asolo Theatre Company created a new touring component for younger audiences, which continued through the 1990s. The plays were seen by hundreds of thousands of students throughout Florida and the Eastern United States. 1973 FSU’s MFA in Acting program came to Sarasota. The FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training was born. 1975 Asolo Stage Two was created in downtown Sarasota, producing a full season of plays. After stage managing Asolo Stage Two, Linda DiGabriele became Tour Director for expanding touring operations. 1976 PBS’ “Theatre in America” chooses Asolo Theatre Company as one of only eight companies in the U.S. to be featured on its national television series with a performance of The Patriots by Sidney Kingsley. 1977 The company appears on PBS once again with End of Summer by S.N. Behrman, starring Helen Hayes. The 70’s 1981 The 1981 season was the final complete season under the Artistic Leadership of Robert Strane, who had shaped Asolo Theatre’s history for 21 years. 1983 John Ulmer took the reins as Artistic Director. 1985 The leadership team of Ulmer, Fallon and new Associate Executive Director Stephen Rothman began firing on all cylinders. This season featured many sold-out performances and the successful New York transfer of Dames at Sea. Despite the critical success of the season (436 performances of 13 plays), the theatre was now operating with a two-million-dollar budget and  Asolo Rep experienced difficulties meeting its growing financial obligations. 1986 The Bette Oliver Theatre was created in the Adolph “Chick” Frankel Building for Conservatory and smaller Asolo Theatre productions. 1989 The company outgrew the Historic Asolo Theatre in Sarasota, Florida. With community support, Asolo Rep constructed a new building — the Asolo Center for the Performing Arts. In recognition of its historic roots and to celebrate the best of European-style theatre, the Dunfermline Opera House was purchased from Scotland and reconstructed inside the Center. It became the Mertz Theatre, honoring some of the most notable benefactors in Asolo Theatre’s history: Harold E. and Esther M. Mertz. The new building houses not only the 500-seat Mertz but a smaller performance space for more intimate plays, room for rehearsal, conservatory classes, as well as production and administrative offices. Cyrano de Bergerac was the final performance in the historic venue, followed by a candlelight procession to the new building on the Ringling grounds. Linda DiGabriele stepped into the Managing Director position. The 80’s 1990 The company made the Mertz Theatre its new mainstage. The first production on the Mertz stage was Lee Blessing’s A Walk in the Woods . This season also marked the transition from John Ulmer to Margaret (Megs) Booker, the lauded founder and Artistic Director of the Intiman Theatre in Seattle. 1991 Ensuring long-term stability, Florida State University acquired the new center. Its name changed to the FSU Center for the Performing Arts (CPA). 1994 Despite bold theatrical productions of Svengali and Das Barbacu, the theatre experienced financial distress that threatened to close the company entirely. The Jane B. Cook Theatre opened in the FSU CPA, becoming the primary performance venue for the Conservatory and a second stage for Asolo Theatre Company. Its first production, Noel Coward’s Hay Fever, opened on November 17. 1995 Howard J. Millman returned as Producing Artistic Director and reinstated the resident company and rotating repertory schedule. He also reincorporated the FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training into the operations of the professional company. 1996 The Sarasota Ballet moved into the FSU Center, sharing the facilities with Asolo Theatre Company and helping cement the long-term viability of both companies. Asolo Theatre Company staged a triumphant production of The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, Parts I & II. 1999 Asolo Theatre made history by celebrating its 40th Anniversary. The 90’s 2003 Asolo Rep hosted a centennial celebration for the Dunfermline Opera House, now the Mertz Theatre, which opened in Scotland in 1903. 2006 Michael Donald Edwards began his tenure as Producing Artistic Director. The Asolo Theatre Company was renamed Asolo Repertory Theatre. The Historic Asolo Theatre in Sarasota, Florida, reopened as a venue and exhibit at the Ringling Museum. The FSU/Asolo Conservatory gave the first guest theatrical performance in the historic theater. 2007 A Tale of Two Cities enjoyed its world premiere and a sold-out run in the Mertz Theatre. The show later transferred to Broadway. Asolo Rep gave its first guest theatrical performance in the Ringling’s historic theater: Nobody Don’t Like Yogi. 2008 Drama Desk and Tony Award®-winner Stephen Schwartz worked with Asolo Rep to re-imagine an updated production of Working , with new songs by Tony Award-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda and choreography by Josh Rhodes. Barnum , produced by Asolo Rep in co-production with Maltz Jupiter Theatre and starring Brad Oscar, enjoyed a sold-out run and won multiple Carbonell Awards. In the Historic Asolo Theatre, Asolo Rep produced the American premiere of The Blonde,the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead by Robert Hewett. Asolo Rep purchased 10 condos for use as artist housing. 2009 Thanks to major gifts from Beverly Koski and others, Asolo Rep purchased a warehouse property at 1009 Tallevast Road. This location later became dedicated as the Robert and Beverly Koski Production Center in 2014. The Center came to feature The Joan Armour Mendell Scenic Studio and the Ted Weiller Rehearsal Hall. Asolo Rep presented another notable world premiere with Jason Wells’ award-winning production of Perfect Mendacity. The dance-driven musical, Contact, was produced in a landmark partnership with the Sarasota Ballet. Asolo Rep’s production of The Life of Galileo garnered national attention and an outstanding review by The Wall Street Journal’s Terry Teachout. Asolo Repertory Theatre made history yet again with its 50th Anniversary. The 2000’s 2010 Asolo Rep produced Bonnie & Clyde, starring Laura Osnes (reprising the role she originated at La Jolla Playhouse) and Jeremy Jordan (debuting as Clyde in Sarasota). Jeff Calhoun directs the musical, which features a book by Ivan Menchell, lyrics by Don Black and music by Frank Wildhorn. Bonnie & Clyde receives national attention and moves to Broadway’s Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre for a fall 2011 opening, starring Osnes and Jordan. 2011 Twelve Angry Men, directed by Tony Award-winner Frank Galati, gains national attention with a rave review by The Wall Street Journal’s Terry Teachout.

Asolo Rep earned recognition with this award for contributing to the spirit of adventure and exploration through education in the arts and bringing rich and engaging experiences to audiences. Once in a Lifetime, directed by Mark Rucker, received national attention from a rave review by the Wall Street Journal’s Terry Teachout. Asolo Rep’s production of Yentl and its music composer Jill Sobule were featured on NPR’s “All Things Considered: Weekend Edition.” The national broadcast featured original music from the show. The Florida Professional Theatres Association established the Victor “Vic” Meyrich Award for Excellence in and Dedication to Professional Theatre in the Area of Technical and Production Work in recognition of Asolo Rep’s longtime Production Manager. Victor Meyrich was the award’s first recipient. 2017 With a major gift from Herman and Sharon Frankel, Asolo Rep purchased property at 5333 N. Tamiami Trail to provide additional meeting, office and archive space. The property is now known as the Herman and Sharon Frankel Asolo Rep Annex. Asolo Rep purchased property adjacent to its current Tallevast Road facility with a major gift from Beverly Koski — fulfilling the vision of The Koski Production Center Campus. The Josh Rhodes-helmed production of Evita , starring Ana Isabelle, was a smash hit that broke box office records. 2018 The 2018/19 season at Asolo Rep Theatre made history — celebrating years on stage.

The 2010’s 2020 The Ground Floor, Asolo Rep’s initiative to nurture new works and new artists, opened the doors of its newly refurbished rehearsal-hall-turned-performance-space with its first official reading. Due to the onset of the global pandemic, Asolo Rep took the unprecedented step of closing its doors mid-season, canceling more than 200 performances. With a pivot to online programs and the generous support of the community, charitable foundations and government programs, Asolo Rep weathered the storm. Programs like Ground Floor: Making Musicals, the Engage on Air podcast and Monday Musical Moments help keep audiences connected despite restrictions. 2021 With indoor performances impossible due to the pandemic, Asolo Rep created the Terrace Stage — a brand-new outdoor venue on the FSU Center for Performing Arts steps. Asolo Rep went on to be one of only a few LORT theatres able to produce at all in 2021. Asolo Rep ultimately produced five shows on the Terrace Stage, including launching the rolling world premiere of Cheryl L. West’s Fannie: The Music and Life of Fannie Lou Hamer, a one-woman show with music starring E. Faye Butler.
