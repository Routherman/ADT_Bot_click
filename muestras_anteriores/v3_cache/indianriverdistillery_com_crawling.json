      "text": "Vero Beach couple to open first whiskey distillery on Treasure Coast Why is the president of the Martin County teachers union calling a School Board decision \"anti-teacher\"? News Indian River Martin St. Lucie Sports Advertise Obits eNewspaper Legals WHATTODOIN772 Vero Beach couple to open first Treasure Coast distillery, use Florida native ingredients Laurie K. Blandford Treasure Coast Newspapers Ray and Mandy Hooker are so close to starting the first craft distillery on the Treasure Coast, they can taste it. The married couple, both from Vero Beach, has been talking about their new business since about 2015 and are just a city lease approval away from opening Indian River Distillery at the Vero Beach Regional Airport in January 2022. “I really like whiskey, and Mandy likes whiskey,” Ray Hooker said. “She likes bourbon, and I’m more of a scotch snob.” 21st Amendment: New distillery plans to open in downtown Vero Beach Hani Honey: First meadery opens in Martin County Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. Sour Sea Cow: Brothers use local ingredients to make hard sour ciders in Fort Pierce Learning to distill Kentucky whiskey Ray, 42, a third-generation Vero Beach native, grew up in Sebastian and graduated from Sebastian River High School . He met Mandy, 43, at the former Long Branch Saloon in Vero Beach. They’ve homeschooled their 12-year-old son, Chandler, since kindergarten. They already owned Other Side Services , a pest control and landscaping business, when they decided to break into the distilling industry. They sold their business last December to go into their new business full-time. The couple noticed distilleries were becoming more popular nationally, but none were opening locally — only craft breweries. In 2016, they learned how to run a distillery at a weekend workshop in Kentucky. Since then, they’ve been researching and learning as much as they can to open their own local distillery. “I really wanted a business for us that we could do together, that would be long-term and that we could enjoy together and have fun,” Ray said. Vero Beach owns airport building The Hookers started looking for a location that’s big enough to house a distillery and still have room to grow. They found a 4,000-square-foot derelict building the city owns on the northeast corner of Aviation Boulevard and Airport Drive, across from the Mobil gas station. It was built in the 1970s, then turned into a strip mall, then slated for demolition in two years. Rather than destroy the building, the Hookers found it would be more cost-effective to renovate it into a warehouse with a tasting room on one end and a large production facility in the middle. The end unit, previously Tubby’s Famous All American Subs, would remain home to the Flat Dog Diner . The City Council this month approved amending the airport’s zoning to allow craft distilleries. The next step will be getting the city’s approval of a 10-year lease, which Ray hopes to get by Oct. 1, to stay on track to open the second week of January. The building will require some demolition, painting, electrical work and new equipment to become a distillery, he said. Using Florida natural ingredients Until the lease is approved, the Hookers are taking online classes through the Institute of Brewing and Distilling in London to learn more about all the different kinds of liquor and spirits they plan to make. Some of their products will be seasonal while others will always be available, such as their rum. While that ages after they open, they plan to sell other whiskeys under their newly trademarked brand, N.O.W., which stands for Not Our Whiskey. “We needed whiskey now, and good whiskey takes times,” Ray said, “so this is not our whiskey.” The more local the ingredients used in their liquors, he said, the smaller the batch. They plan to distribute in the future, but not immediately. For the distillery’s “Hibiscus City Gin,” they plan to use sour orange peel and hibiscus, both grown in Vero Beach, as well as local juniper, which is the main ingredient in gin and typically an alpine plant. “We’ve identified a native juniper that lives in Florida,” Ray said. “We’ve actually made gin out of things that we have in our yard.” He’s excited to try to make a spirit out of honey too. He plans to distill the mead after fermenting the honey. Mandy is a beekeeper and maintains medicinal plants in their three-acre yard, where they raise chickens and grow vegetables. “I come from a landscaping background,” Ray said. “I’m kind of a plant nerd.” Ray plans to use wild oranges from old groves — typically too sour to eat — to make a sour orange 'cello for a different take on a limoncello. The distillery will stick to spirits only, no beer or wine, but the Hookers are learning about cocktails from mixologists. “When I was growing up, a cocktail was Crown (Royal) and ginger ale,” Ray said. “But there are really amazing cocktails that we can make. The options are endless.” Next up: 21st Amendment Distillery The Hookers are just steps ahead of another craft distillery aiming to open next year in downtown Vero Beach. Jeff Palleschi, 51, is waiting for the City Council's final approval at its Sept. 21 meeting to change the zoning on the Ironside Press building’s property from commercial to light industrial to allow him to open 21st Amendment Distillery by late 2022. The distillery founders aren't rivals, but have a collaborative relationship, Ray said. They plan to go to Tampa together in October for the Sunshine Spirits Festival , the first craft distillery festival in the state via the newly founded Florida Craft Spirits Association . They attended the association’s first annual meeting in May together. Ray said there’s room for a few distilleries in Indian River County. “A rising tide is going to raise all the ships,” he said. “We have a monumental task of educating our community on what a craft distillery is. We have to teach people the difference between a distillery and a brewery and a meadery.” The Hookers aren't trying to compete with Jack Daniel’s, and plan to keep their distillery local. “I’m not wanting to dominate the entire world with our products, and I’m not wanting to dominate all of Florida or the southeastern U.S. with our products,” Ray said. “Somebody else is already doing that, and I want to do something different.” Florida trails California in licensed liquor distilleries Florida is behind the curve when it comes to craft distilleries, he said. The state has 62 licensed distilleries, with fewer than 50 currently producing, compared to over 200 in California, said Florida Craft Spirits Association President David Cohen. Florida's distilled spirits consumption is about 51.1 million gallons, second to California's 73.4 million gallons, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States . The number of Florida distilleries has doubled in the past five years, however, indicating an upward swing, Cohen said. The closest distilleries to the Treasure Coast appear to be Steel Tie Spirits Co. in West Palm Beach, Oceanside Distillery in Cape Canaveral and Honey Lane Distillery in Mims. Laurie K.

Photo courtesy of Ray Hooker +1 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save VERO BEACH ― Vero Beach natives Ray and Mandy Hooker recently received approval from the Vero Beach City Council and the Planning and Zoning Board to open a distillery on city-owned property near the airport. If all goes as planned, the Hookers expect to open Indian River Distillery the second week of January. The couple needed to jump through some hoops to get approval for the business, since there was no provision for distilleries in Vero Beach zoning. “There was no zoning in the city of Vero Beach or Indian River County at all that allowed distillation to happen,” Ray Hooker told Hometown News. “So we had to do a change of text amendment with the city of Vero Beach to add it in the airport light industrial zoning area. First we went in front of the planning and zoning board, and it was passed unanimously. They then kick it up to the city council, where our change of text amendment passed unanimously. So we’re good to go. Not one person objected, which I was really happy about.” According to a Planning Director Jason Jeffries, the Hookers needed to obtain approval for “a text amendment to Chapter 62, Article VII, Airport Master Plan Land Use Zones, to add craft distilleries to the ALl-1, Airport Light lndustrial-1 zoning district. The purpose of the text amendment is to allow facilities for the distilling of spirits and packaging of distilled spirits for distribution, retail or wholesale, on or off premise that produces less than 250,000 gallons per year in the ALl-1 zoning district. Adding this use to the ALl-1 zoning district will allow craft distilleries, a use compatible with the other commercial and light industrial uses in the zoning district.” “Currently, the craft distillery use is not permitted in the city,” Mr. Jeffries said in his memo recommending approval. “This industrial use is compatible with the other commercial and light industrial uses in the AU-1 zoning district.” To obtain the zoning change, the Hookers needed to pay about $3,000 in application fees. The Planning and Zoning Board conducted a public hearing on June 17, and voted 5-0 to recommend approval to the city council. Indian River Distillery will be located at 3212 to 3308 Aviation Blvd., on the corner of Airport Road and Aviation Blvd., in a metal building that was built on airport property in the 1970s. The building currently has one tenant, a restaurant that will remain in the location for now. The Hookers expect to use around 1,800 square feet for a tasting room, and 2,500 square feet for production. They hope to feature locally sourced ingredients as much as possible. “We want to do a lot of small batch things with ingredients that you can’t get anywhere else,” Mr. Hooker said. “As an example, I know a few people in town that have sugar cane that they grow. I’ll get a hold of as much things like that as I possibly can to do a limited run batch. So, for example, we can make a rum out of sugar cane grown right here in Vero Beach, or a whiskey from corn we get just west of town. Our products will highlight local history and local resources, instilling community pride in Vero Beach and Indian River County.” “We’re also using locally grown hibiscus for a gin, with the type of hibiscus that’s used in medicinal teas,” Mandy Hooker said. “Hibiscus gin is gaining popularity, and since Vero is the hibiscus city, we wanted to highlight that, another local ingredient and a tie to our community. We’re trying to be very Vero-centric and Florida-centric in everything that we do.” “We found that there is a native juniper in Florida that we can get for our gin,” Mr. Hooker said. “I called plant growers I know throughout Florida and found that Sebastian River Farm had some giant juniper plants, so we got from them three giant juniper plants so we’d have a good run of local juniper berries for our gin.” According to Mr. Hooker, the distillery will save the city money they would have otherwise used to demolish the building. “The city was planning on tearing the building down after the current tenant’s lease is up because the bathrooms are not ADA-compliant, and the city had determined it was most cost-effective to tear the building down rather than replacing seven individual bathrooms. Our uses don’t need seven individual bathrooms, since we’ll be using pretty much the entire building as one or two large spaces, so it’s going to be much more cost-effective for us to do it. Instead of the city tearing the building down, we’re going to lease it and renovate it. It’s a win-win; the city’s not going to have to spend money on demolishing the building and then leasing the empty lot.” “I’m a third generation native here,” Mr. Hooker said. “My grandfather was raised on a farm on the north end of John’s Island. My son was born here, Mandy was born here. We’re Florida people from way back. My family has been in Florida since the 1870s. I love Florida, our swamps, our marshes, our lakes, our woods. I want to keep a Florida theme on everything we do, just to educate people about what Florida is. People around the country think of the beach when they think of Florida, but Florida is a lot more than that.” While the couple declined to say how much they are investing in the business, Ray Hooker did say it is “everything we’ve got.” There are no other major investors, and they hope to eventually employ up to 15 people.

      "text": "Our Story | Dread River Distillery – Alabama’s Finest Whiskey About VISIT shop LOCATION EVENTS contact ABOUT Dread river Against the Grain Dread River symbolizes the chasm between us and where we wanted to go, the relentless torrent of issues and roadblocks, and the frigid fear of failure. In making this distillery a reality, we realized that overcoming our fears isn’t just something we did; it’s who we are. For us, DREAD is not a paralytic. It’s an inspiration, a challenge just waiting to be accepted. Our goal is to inspire our friends to face their fears with us. There's dread in all of us. Heart. soul. sustenance. Dr. Jeff Dugas and John Cubelic began the Dread River journey in the spring of 2017. Their initial business concept was a small craft whiskey distillery, which has since evolved to include a bar and tasting room serving the full line of Dread River products, a full-service kitchen, merchandise store, and 4,000 sq. foot event space. After two years of development and a jungle of red tape, the distillery opened in August 2019 with the goal of making genuinely excellent whiskey. Six months later, that goal was superseded by the global demand for sanitizer during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, on the other side of that unexpected detour, Dread River is picking back up where it left off, creating products worthy of celebration. With years spent developing and growing into what we are now,  our mission has stayed the same. Dread River was founded to inspire you to share your stories -- overcome obstacles, live bravely, and drink deeply -- in the hopes that we can become a companion on your journey.  So, we offer you a glass. A toast to your accomplishments. Because we know your best stories are still yet to be written.
