The Deer Creek Golf & Country Club was the venue of choice to host the couple’s memorable day. The bride requested blush pink, gold, white, and ivory tones which worked well to accomplish the look, both indoors and out. She carried a French hand-wrapped bouquet which included roses, lisianthus, matthiola, hydrangea, and touches of silver dollar eucalyptus and ruscus. The bouquet’s natural design with varying texture and color palette blended beautifully and complemented the chuppah, and more importantly, her groom’s dark grey tuxedo. The four-post structure featuring sheer white fabric was drawn open and appointed with stylish clusters of the petite bride’s floral selection. The upper portion held a large spray of flowers with plenty of greenery delicately placed throughout. State-of-the-art LED lighting completed the effect when it illuminated the traditional canopy. After the ceremony, guests gathered to celebrate the newlyweds in the Key West Ballroom. Elevated lush floral arrangements filled the newly renovated space along with many variations of candlelight. Soft foliage, rose petals, and gold accents added to the intimate affair. Deerfield Beach’s premier county club certainly was a picturesque paradise for the new “Mr. & Mrs. Goldman”.
