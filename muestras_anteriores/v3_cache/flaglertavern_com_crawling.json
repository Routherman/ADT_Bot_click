Alas those days are long gone, but surely not forgotten.  And like many of us, separated from our family by distance, we have created our own “families” through friends and work-mates, forging new traditions and memories.  Over the years I’ve learned in my zeal to try to recreate my family holiday dinners, what a huge amount of stress and work it was.  Shopping, prepping, getting up at the crack of dawn to get the turkey in the oven, breaking out the family china, cleaning the house, decorating…OH MY, I’m tired just thinking about it.  And of course, by the time you set the food on the table being so tired (and full) that you can barely enjoy the conversation, the friends the family you so fervently want to connect with and make happy. Maybe you are one of those super women (or men) that can make it all look easy.  I never have been.  My closest friends can see it on my face.  I try to make it look easy, but I just look stressed.  I often marvel at my grandmother’s ability to get it all done!  So what does my failure as a modern day Martha Stewart have to do with Flagler Tavern?  Well just this, through a Lemony Snicket series of events the road of my life finds me coordinating events at Flagler Tavern.  This is a dream job of sorts for me, being able to help our guests create life-long memories for their weddings, rehearsal dinner and holiday parties and more, with a crew of talented chefs, servers, bartenders and event staff that can do, as a team, what I could never do on my own.  Now this for me, is something magical!  I can’t tell you the immense satisfaction it brings to be able to take some of that, all to familiar stress, away from our guests on their important day so they can enjoy their friends and family and relax knowing we are taking good care of them.  That to me is everything! So this holiday season, if you are starting to feel the pressures of hosting the perfect holiday party or just want to for once, sit back and enjoy your friends and family and let someone else do all the work, we’ve got you!  From ugly sweater parties to formal seated dinners; from causal to fancy we can help you create a warm and wonderful, truly unique holiday party for your family, friends or work-mates that is stress-free.   Let us help you plan your holiday party this year.  Trust me, you may never defrost a turkey again! —Food for Thought— Elaine Share on: « Back Join Our Newsletter Connect With Us Loyalty Program Login | Learn More Contact us 414 Flagler Avenue New Smyrna Beach, FL 32169 Open Today (386) 402-8861 info@flaglertavern.com ©2025 Flagler Tavern.

No one knows this better than our owners Theo, Sherman and Mike, here at Flagler Tavern. Every day of the week you can spot at least one, and often all three of our owners, on-site, chatting with customers, meeting with managers, staff and vendors, and examining the premise with an expert eye to making sure the Flagler Tavern maintains a level of maintenance, cleanliness and ambiance that is up to their expectations.  It’s their hands-on approach and attention to detail that has allowed the Flagler Tavern to grow and thrive under their stewardship without losing is small town charm. Which is why we were thrilled that the Flagler Avenue Business Association selected owner Theo Mundell to be among the handful of Flagler Avenue business owners to represent the Avenue for the launch of it’s new “Meet Me on Flagler Ave” campaign. Take a peek at the great video they shot of Theo recently. Although it’s often heard…”I know Theo”, you might learn a thing or two about our charismatic owner who is larger than life in the “wee bio” that accompanies the video at https://flaglerave.com/merchants/theo-mundell/ . The next time you are on Flagler Avenue, stop by Flagler Tavern, make sure to give a wave to Theo and perhaps join him in a “wee” Baby Guinness!

We've repurposed parts of the original Flagler Tavern building within the newly renovated upstairs area. The result is an eclectic mix of vintage, nautical-inspired decor. The Bounty offers a more intimate setting for guests who want to escape the noise and bustle of nightlife below. It’s ideal for a private, high-end dining experience or cocktails with friends. Escape upstairs to the speakeasy! The front deck offers amazing views of the ocean and Flagler Avenue, along with a separate bar called the \"Wee Bait Shack,\" serving beer and cocktails.
