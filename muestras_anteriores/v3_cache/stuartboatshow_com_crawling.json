I was born a few miles from the banks of Lake Lanier. Fishing has always been my passion. When you think there is no one on the lake, think again. I fish nearly 250 days a year, charter or no charter. I follow the movements of striped bass from the dam to the shallow, swift currents up the rivers. I know every inch of Lake Lanier and have caught fish in every creek there is. In the last 16 years, I have developed a need to share and teach others my knowledge of these fish. The look and expressions on a persons face that have never caught a fish or the avid angler that just can’t get enough is what drives my passion. Thanks to all the people I have met over the years and taking YOU fishing is why I wake up every morning. in partnership with official show sponsors Date/Time January 8-11, 2026 THU 11 AM - 8 PM FRI 11 AM - 8 PM SAT 10 AM - 8 PM SUN 10 AM - 5 PM Georgia World Congress Center - Hall B 285 Andrew Young International Blvd NW Atlanta GA 30313 General Show Inquiries: 314.287.6102 info@atlantaboatshow.com Become an Exhibitor: 502.753.1441 ngaw@nmma.org Get Show Updates Facebook Twitter Instagram © 2025 NMMA All rights reserved | Customer Privacy Policy"
