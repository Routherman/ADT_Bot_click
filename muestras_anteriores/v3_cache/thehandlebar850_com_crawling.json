Dismiss Events Notable Acts Booking Bar Menu About Contact Visit our Facebook Visit our Instagram about us Since 1983, The Handlebar has always been known as the home for Pensacola’s Music Scene. Now in its third rendition, The Handlebar continues to stand behind that message. Music is a unifier among people from numerous walks of life. Music helps us escape the moment and connect with both friends and strangers. The Handlebar has reopened its doors to make sure that Pensacola always has a place to experience underground & alternative music. Our venue is a focused blend of the old and new. Our historical brick walls and steel beams are paired with a brand new bar with substantial offerings, an upgraded sound and lighting system, an enhanced patio entranceway, and four revamped bathrooms to create a pleasing atmosphere where you can enjoy going to shows and hanging out to the fullest. The Handlebar extends beyond its walls and into the community, connecting its music diehards with its bar regulars. We are the place for everyone, especially those who don’t (or don’t want to) fit the mold. The Handlebar gave us all memories years ago and we want to continue giving our community lasting memories for years to come. learn more 11.08.1983 The Start Deloris Pierce the owner of DEE'S family was a French Creole family out of New Orleans. Her father, Abe Pierce owned Abe's 506 and The Saber Club. Lee, Tom, and Jim would come and hang out,  and she offered to sell it to them... and that's how the Handlebar started. 04.11.2001 The Fire In the early morning hours of April 11, 2001, a fire gutted the HandleBar's historic brick building. 12.21.2002 Rebuild A lot of help from a lot of great people! 20 months later we reopened with Lowell Husband and new Co-Owner. Previously partitioned into three separate rooms, the building now has no interior walls. 11.01.2018 Closed Down In November 2018, the popular venue suddenly, and permanently closed... or so we thought! 08.13.2022 Present Time New owners, Kathy Sandstrom and Chris McKean, worked with manager Robert Goodspeed and reopened after almost 4 years closed, with a full remodel. The attendee entrance is now through the outdoor courtyard, on Belmont St. and boasts a full liquor license.

(Leah Hogsten  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) HandleBar, a new bar in Salt Lake City's Marmalade District, features iconic photos of famous mustached men, vintage bicycles hanging from the ceiling and one-of-a-kind bar stools made from bicycle parts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Salt Lake City’s booming Marmalade neighborhood has a new watering hole that offers residents a twist on the traditional “biker” bar. The HandleBar, 751 N. 300 West, opened earlier this week and is geared toward thirsty cyclists and anyone who appreciates a thick, twisting mustache, said David Morris, co-owner with Jesse Wilkerson. Those names might sound familiar. HandleBar is the fifth Utah bar for Morris — who sports an impressive mustache and sideburns. He currently owns Piper Down in Salt Lake City and Ice Haus in Murray. He also is the co-owner — with Bridget Gordon, owner of Green Pig Pub — of Ogden’s Funk ’n Dive Bar and Harp and Hound gastropub. Wilkerson is no stranger to the food and dining scene, either. He owns Trolley Wing Co. restaurants in Sugar House and Midvale. HandleBar replaces Club Jam, a popular gay bar and dance club that opened in 2008 but in recent years had struggled. “When the area wasn’t as residential,” Morris said, “a dance club made more sense.” (Leah Hogsten|The Salt Lake Tribune) The new sign at HandleBar showcases its cycling and mustache theme. That’s true. At one point in the 1970s, Salt Lake City could boast 10 gay or lesbian bars. Now, with the closure of Jam, two remain: the Sun Trapp and Club Try-Angles . The slow demise of the gay bar scene, in Utah and nationally, has largely been attributed to the rise of the internet and dating apps. “It’s exciting and sad at the same time,” said Rob Moolman, executive director of the Utah Pride Center , who added that having “queer spaces” where the LGBTQ community can “come out and be themselves” is important. Times have changed, Moolman said. For the most part, “young people today are growing up in a different climate of understanding and inclusivity. They can walk into any [bar or restaurant] space and be themselves.” He pointed to Salt Lake City’s recent Pride Festival and Parade, which enjoyed some of their largest turnouts, according to preliminary numbers. The success was marred, however, when a group of men, yelling slurs, chased gay people into a downtown dessert cafe. The Marmalade district is still a place many LGBTQ individuals call home. They affectionately dub it the “gayborhood” and proudly fly rainbow flags from nearby balconies and windows. Once a neglected area of Salt Lake City, it is now experiencing a renaissance with a new library, scores of new apartments and condominiums under construction and many older homes being renovated. Bars and restaurants are sure to follow the growth. In addition to HandleBar, Blue Copper Coffee, a Salt Lake City-based small batch roaster, has posted a “coming soon” sign on a nearby building. (Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Vintage bicycles hang from the ceiling at HandleBar in Salt Lake City. Customers won’t recognize the old Club Jam building. Morris and Wilkerson gutted the inside, cut big windows to make it airy and light, built a new wood bar and hung bicycles from the ceiling for decoration. There are even one-of-a-kind bar stools made with bicycle parts. There is a large bike rack out front to park your two-wheelers; you’ll see a mustache “Hall of Fame” as you walk toward the restroom. It features photos of famous mustaches from former President Theodore Roosevelt to actors Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley. (Leah Hogsten  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) HandleBar, a new \"biker\" bar in Salt Lake City's Marmalade District, features iconic photos of famous mustached men, including Freddie Mercury, Utah's own Wilford Brimley, Cheech Marin and Burt Reynolds. The are dozens of beers on tap and cocktails with names to match the bar’s theme. Look for Brigham’s Mustache Ride (we’re blushing) and Porter’s Unicycle — legend has it that Orrin Porter Rockwell, Brigham Young’s famous bodyguard, liked to ride a unicycle around the Mormon temple, Morris said. The HandleBar kitchen is a work in progress, but the property is large enough to accommodate a regular rotation of food trucks, Morris said. The trucks will be parked close to the patio with its lights and colorful umbrellas. Eventually, the partners hope to build a restaurant in the empty lot behind the bar, although they’re not sure what the menu or theme will be. “Sometimes,” Morris said, “you just have to listen to the space and the neighborhood and what people want.” (Leah Hogsten  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) The colorful patio at HandleBar in Salt Lake City's Marmalade District.

If so, did you like it? Probably not. It’s a dreaded task that developers would love to pass on to marketing. Or anyone for that matter. But sometimes it’s not possible. So we decided to hack something together that might make it slightly less painful to draft emails with variables — especially transactional emails. We hope it means you get a MailChimp-like experience without using MailChimp. Press enter or click to view image in full size Demo URL: https://handlebars-email-html-previewer.vercel.app/ The preview app does three main things: Let’s you draft/modify a HTML template with variables containing handlebars & instantly preview it in the browser Put some test variables into JSON to see that they’re working Send a test email to Mailtrap Note: right now we don’t save your template anywhere but we plan to implement this later. For now, copy-paste and don’t close the tab! You can see the client code here and the server code that connects with Mailtrap here . How we built the Editor We wanted to have a nice coding experience in the browser so we tried out a ton of different packages including: React Ace Editor React Textarea Code Editor React Simple Code Editor But we found them all either difficult to work with, outdated or a bit laggy for us. They’re probably all great but we didn’t have time so we moved on if we couldn’t get it working smoothly quickly. Press enter or click to view image in full size Finally, I came across a comment on Reddit suggesting Monaco because VSCode is built on top of it. Monaco worked perfectly out the box (except for a tiny bit of flashing when you type) It also had some really nice advanced features like autocomplete and a map view. It was also really easy to implement. import Editor from \"@monaco-editor/react\"; interface Props { code: string; onChange: (code: string) => void; } function MyEditor(props: Props) { return ( <Editor value={props.code} language=\"handlebars\" defaultValue=\"Please enter HTML code.\" theme=\"vs-dark\" onChange={(newvalue?: string) => props.onChange(newvalue || '')} /> ); } export default MyEditor; It pretty much works the same as a text box where you update the state on change. As you can see we also changed it to dark mode 😎 Press enter or click to view image in full size Using Handlebars to add variables Handlebars are commonly used in HTML emails to make them dynamic. You can use it like so Your HTML code ... <p>{{name}}</p> ... The opening {{ and closing }} indicate a handlebar variable, more information can be found here . Then we use the Handlebars compiler to turn our HTML (with handlebars variables) to plain HTML with inserted variables. import Handlebars from 'handlebars'; const data = { name: \"John\" } const handlebarsTemplate = Handlebars.compile(YOUR_HTML); const parsedHtml = handlebarsTemplate(data); // this transforms the code to ... <p>John</p> ... Handlebars is quite powerful. You can add in conditional logic, loops, etc… Press enter or click to view image in full size Previewing the email But now, the tricky part! How do you know your handlebars actually work with the given data? That was the whole reason we made this tool, easy validation of our handlebar templates with live previews. On each code change we update your live preview, so you can see exactly how your code looks, and behaves. Press enter or click to view image in full size We also provided a way of inputting test data. Click on the top right corner on “set test data”. This will open up a JSON editor. Here you can add the variables you declared in your HTML template with handlebars, alongside their test data values. For instance if you have a variable {{name}} in your HTML template, you can create JSON test data like this: { \"name\":\"Satoshi Nakamoto\" } Sending test emails to Mailtrap The final feature of this tool allows you to send your preview to your Mailtrap inbox. This is important because the browser preview is not always going to be perfectly accurate. Click on “Mailtrap” in the top right corner, this will open up the config modal. You’ll be asked for: Inbox ID: This can be found in the url when you open up your inbox in Mailtrap Api Key: Can be found under settings → API keys in Mailtrap Press enter or click to view image in full size You only need to input these once, it will be stored in local storage for easy use afterwards Then go ahead and click “send test email”! This will send a test email to your mailtrap using a small node application we made ( which can be found here ). We use this small node server to avoid CORS errors, the only purpose is to take your HTML, and send a request to the mailtrap API. If you like this, we’d love to hear what we should do next with this project. This article was a joint effort between myself & Nick Smet Further info We didn’t focus on how to send emails with nodemailer. There are a lot of tutorials out there, here are some suggestions: https://dev.to/lo_victoria2666/how-to-build-a-contact-form-with-javascript-and-nodemailer-3i1k https://dev.to/search?q=nodemailer https://dev.to/jlong4223/how-to-implement-email-functionality-with-node-js-react-js-nodemailer-and-oauth2-2h7m JavaScript React Email Transactional Emails Mailtrap -- -- 2 Written by Jack Bridger 10 followers · 20 following Responses ( 2 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"

Dismiss Events Notable Acts Booking Bar Menu About Contact Visit our Facebook Visit our Instagram Six Feet Under Death Metal Band Tampa’s Death ’n’ Roll Icons Six Feet Under death metal band originated in Tampa, Florida, in 1993 as a side project of Cannibal Corpse’s Chris Barnes and Obituary’s Allen West. After Barnes left Cannibal Corpse in 1995, the band became his primary focus. Fronted by founding vocalist Chris Barnes — known for his guttural style — the current lineup also includes bassist Jeff Hughell, drummer Marco Pitruzzella, and guitarists Ray Suhy and Jack Owen (ex-Cannibal Corpse). This lineup brings death metal pedigree to the group. Their debut album, Haunted (1995), launched their signature blend of groove-heavy death metal, later dubbed “death ’n’ roll” . The follow-up, Warpath (1997), cemented their slow, crushing aesthetic and featured cover songs like “Death or Glory”. Between 1999 and 2003, albums like Maximum Violence, True Carnage, and Bringer of Blood earned commercial recognition—True Carnage peaked at #18 on the Billboard charts—showing how their formula resonated with fans. They’ve since released 14 studio albums, including Nightmares of the Decomposed (2020) and 2024’s Killing for Revenge, which explores themes of violence and retribution and marked another partnership between Barnes and Jack Owen. Musically, Six Feet Under death metal band is defined by plodding grooves, crunchy riffs, and Barnes’ graphic lyrical style—covering gore, murder, and apocalyptic themes—offering an identifiable, heavy sound. Their strategy also includes several cover albums like Graveyard Classics, showcasing their ability to reinterpret classic rock tracks through a death metal lens. Live performances remain integral to their identity. In September–October 2025, they will embark on the \"Midnight In Hell\" U.S. tour with Exhorder, Wretched, and Incite, including standout stops like Tampa’s Orpheum and Aftershock Festival in Sacramento. Sales data shows Six Feet Under ranks as the fourth best-selling death metal act in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan—highlighting their enduring commercial impact. With a strong discography, veteran lineup, consistent touring, and a unique death ’n’ roll sound, Six Feet Under death metal band stands as heavyweight legends in extreme metal—blending brutality, groove, and legacy.
