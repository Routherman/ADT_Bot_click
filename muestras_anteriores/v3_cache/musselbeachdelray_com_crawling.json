Larner steams her hot dogs and then grills them to make sure they're cooked all the way through. BAY CITY, MI — The owner of an eatery here that placed in the top 3 of a statewide MLive coney dog competition called today \"one of the best days\" of her life after hearing of the praise. “The phone has been ringing off the hook,” said Jacquie Larner, owner of Mussel Beach. “We’re just thrilled.” After spending last week searching for the state’s best coney dog — a journey that included Detroit, Flint, Jackson, Muskegon, Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids — reporter John Gonzalez today unveiled his favorite 10 locations. Larner’s diner placed third behind three Detroit mainstays. Here’s what Gonzalez had to say about Mussel Beach: \" After he visited (on Thursday), we got to thinking, 'We don't stand a chance in hell because we're not a coney place,'\" Larner said. \"But I came here this morning and my husband said, 'You aren't going to believe this.' The phone has been ringing off the hook ever since.\" She estimates she’s “sold more coney dogs in the last three days than we have the last three weeks” because of the coverage leading up to the results unveiling. “We’re tickled (MLive) wanted to include us in this,” Larner said. “It’s what we do. It’s like working at Ford and having a winning truck. “It’s big competition out there.” Bay City’s Zef’s and Mr. Hot Dog were among the other restaurants visited. Saginaw’s Old Town Drive-In placed No. 9 on Gonzalez’s list. Follow reporter Justin Engel on Facebook and Twitter .

About Mussel Rock Beach: Mu ssel Rock Beach is a beautiful sandy and rugged stretch of coastline nestled at the Pacifica/Daly City line situated below Mussel Rock Car Park. The area features coastal bluffs with sweeping scenic views of the Pacific Ocean, amazing sunsets and a serene place for reflection. On a clear day, visitors may also be able to take in a view of the elusive Farallon Islands (often shrouded in fog) located 26 miles off shore of the Golden Gate Bridge. Mussel Rock itself is a rock formation known as stack where a headland is unevenly eroded leaving small islands. It is a popular spot for hang gliders brave enough to jump off the area’s cliffs and soar into the coastal sky. There are a few walkable paths, though most are steep and can be treacherous. Become a volunteer Site Captain Assistant at Mussel Rock. Contact us to learn more! Site Captains: Meet Helen, Chris, Myrna, Ted & Joe. Since 2007, Helen has led monthly Mussel Rock Beach cleanups and our “Mussel Rock Stars” with passion and conviction to ensure a cleaner healthier environment in her residential community. Alongside co-captain and neighbor Julie who joined her in 2012, both advocate for native habitat preservation and litter reduction, particularly cigarette butts, for the beaches and coastline in Pacifica to Daly City. Both are highly involved in monitoring and reporting findings to the proper agencies at this designated Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris Cleanup site which has recently collected and recorded this type of debris. Helen was recognized by the California State Assembly (2014), as well as by Daly City’s City Council for her dedication to establishing the monthly stewardship of Mussel Rock and leading the cause to end cigarette litter pollution along our coastline. About the Cleanup: Time : Fourth Saturday of the month from 9am-11am, rain or shine. Check our online monthly calendar for exact dates. Where to Meet :  At the Mussel Rock carpark located at the lower coastal end of Westline Drive by the second entrance to Allied Waste Transfer Station.  Drive north past the junction of Skyline Drive, avoiding the other Westline Drive that goes up a steep hill. Parking :  Free parking is available all the time on any of the roads or at the car park at the meet up spot. Follow the signs to the car park so that you do not get lost on the other Westline Drive that ends up above the Transfer Station. Cleanup Areas : The team cleans up the streets, bluffs, car park and park, itself, as well as the beach if the tide is out far enough for our safety.  There is the Secret Waterfall nearby that is a good place to clean if you are looking for excitement rappelling down a rope to the bluff and walking down to the beach. Supplies : Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own buckets and reusable gloves. Extra gloves, buckets, pickup sticks and specific tools for this site cleanup will be provided while supplies last. The weather is unpredictable (very cold and windy, although it can be sunny and warm).  Make sure to bring extra layers, a hat, sunblock, water and snacks. Litter : The team usually picks up plastic bags, bottles, cigarettes and other household waste because this is where the Bay Area’s trash is brought before it is transferred to other sites. Mussel Rock Beach is a designated Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris Cleanup Program site, and is the only one that has reported items to NOAA and GGNRA which appear to have originated from Japan. Restrooms : Regrettably, there are no public restrooms at this site. Special Regulations & Precautions Dogs : P ermitted off leash in the park, but there are resident coyotes that may lure dogs away to danger, if they are off leash. This is not a concern if your dog is under excellent voice control and performs recall well. Please be responsible and pick up your dog waste. Fireworks: Read the City of Pacifica’s Restrictions on the use of fireworks on our beaches. BBQs : A BBQ fire pit is situated in the car park, and the team regularly cooks sausages and s’mores during cleanups. Precautions : This area may have drug paraphernalia on the ground, usually plastic tubes and baggies. The terrain is quite bumpy as the San Andreas Fault runs under the area and causes the tarmac to have ripples. Wildlife & Habitat Protection : The tide usually high comes right up to the base of the cliffs, preventing snowy plovers from nesting on our beaches. There are many unusual raptors and other birds at Mussel Rock, either on the rock or in trees in the park. Peregrine falcons, sea gulls, cormorants, brown pelicans are frequently spotted around the area. Our tide pools are some of the most pristine in the area with sea stars, nudibranchs, sea anenomes, and of course, lots and lots of mussels. There are non-native plants, and the team tries to remove some of the worst types, such as gorse and pampas grass. Be sure to read through the Cleanup Guidelines before attending the cleanup.

South Florida Mussel Beach 6:46 Published: Michelle Bernstein and guests review Mussel Beach in Delray Beach. Reviews Name: Ambar Candanedo Occupation: Research Associate Lives In: Miami Restaurant Pick: Cardon y El Tirano Reviewed: Mussel Beach We drove up from Miami, the place was easy to spot since it is located right on the main road along with a lot of other restaurants and shopping. We found free parking quickly about a block away and walked over. We did have reservations but the place was pretty much empty with the exception of two other tables with families. The place looks newly remodeled, its bright with modern nautical décor with a lot of booths for seating options. We were greeted and promptly seated, our server was super friendly and gave us a lot of suggestions. We were hungry so we ordered quickly and everything came out really fast but all at the same time. We had the fire and ice shrimp and the sauces were good but the shrimp was a bit tough, French onion soup was really satisfying and had nice flavor and was super cheesy. The mussels were good, from the numerous options of sauces I tried to keep it simple and ordered Provencal. I felt it was a bit lacking in flavor, maybe I would have liked more garlic or they were just trying to make the mussels flavor be the star but overall it was good. It came with crouton-like bread slices but I found them tough and not very fresh. We also tried the lobster grilled cheese which was good, it had bacon, avo, tomato, cheese, lobster chunks but again lacking in flavor maybe a salt issue and the fries while perfectly crispy did not really taste like truffle. The portions were great, big enough to share. The have a great selection of wines to accompany the food, I choose an albarino and it was great, perfect combo. We did not have dessert so after our mains we asked for the check, which came quickly and we left. Overall it was a nice experience, the service was great and there is a lot of options including non-seafood items. Name: Tom Chiarella Occupation: Bar Owner Lives In: Pompano Beach Restaurant Pick: Mussel Beach Reviewed: Mussel Beach Public parking is adequate. Complimentary Parmesan truffle fries instead of bread. Nice Pinot Noir. The waiter Joe, was friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and very attentive. Crab cake was done with a ginger slaw. Charred Octopus was perfectly charred and surrounded by broccoli and white beans. Lobster and crab encrusted Chilean Sea Bass was perfectly cooked with Coconut ginger rice and lemon beurre blanc sauce. Big portions. Homemade. Donut Holes with vanilla crème glaze. Coconut Cream pie all well done. I would recommend anytime especially on special occasions. Great location. Name: Patricia Bitnar Occupation: Wealth Management Specialist Lives In: Fort Lauderdale Restaurant Pick: Vienna Café & Bistro Reviewed: Mussel Beach The restaurant is easy to find but parking was a bit of a challenge. The restaurant is pleasant with maritime sea-life décor nicely done. It was not busy even though we were there at 7:30PM on a Friday night. We were seated immediately and our server Michelle was great. The menu is ample with good choices. Appetizers (Lobster Rangoon and truffle fries) were good and the main course (grouper in a ginger garlic glaze with asparagus) was superb-size was perfect.
