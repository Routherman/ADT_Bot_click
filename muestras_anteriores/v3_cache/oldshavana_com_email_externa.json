Yes No ickypicky 103 contributions 2 5 of 5 bubbles Great Cuban food and service in the heart of Little Havana Jun 2024 • couples We were in Little Havana in Miami on sad business which we concluded at lunch time. We always try to have Cuban food before leaving the area and there are few places (if any) to have better Cuban food than Southwest Miami. My brother looked up nearby restaurants and Old's Havana popped up with a very high rating, so off we went.\nOnly five minutes away but on a different plane of existence as the area is highly sought out by tourists galore; it was located next to \"domino park.' The neighborhood had other restaurants, cigar stores, and tour buses!!! Old's has a parking lot at the rear of the restaurant, somewhat hidden, but accessible and free  before 6pm. If you use the lot you can enter through the back of the restaurant and skip the crowds out on the sidewalk; save that for later.\nFirst things first. Having lived in Miami a long time and experienced the haughtiness of servers who like to ignore your English we were surprised that almost the entire wait staff spoke excellent English. Didn't matter, I speak fluent Spanish.\nThe restaurant is open air with an air conditioned area up front but not cold. We sat here across from the bar. The restaurant is also known as \"La Casa del Mojito.\" \nmy wife ordered a passion fruit mojito from our very capable, friendly server, Marisabel.\nFor lunch we did not deviate from our usual, Vaca Frita for her Ropa Vieja for me; both dishes can be the standard by which a Cuban restaurant should be judged. Accompanied by maduros (fried plantains) and Yuca con Mojo (cassava with a garlic sauce, some places skimp on the sauce but not here).\nWe shared a flan, a creme caramel dessert and Cafe Cubano (for me, not shared). \nWord of caution: service fee of 18% was automatically added to the bill. Marisabel's work ethic and easy manner was well worth this and more.\nWe expected so-so food once we saw the hawkers out front trying to get people in but would go back anytime. Not a small place and lots of good food and drinks. Read more Written July 21, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Deedee Homestead 105 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Good but hopefully no long wait! Apr 2024 • friends This place was jam packed with tourist which explains our one hour wait for our food…the waitress and manager were very apologetic. We forgave the wait when we received our food which was delicious all around…We received complimentary coffee at the end of our meal. The meal for 5persons with no alcohol was $120 including tip which is automatically added.

Grover R Pensacola 24248 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Great Meal and Incredible Cuban Experience Mar 2025 • couples To truly experience Cuban Miami, you will need to have a dining experience.  We chose to eat our last meal of the vacation here while visiting the sites of Calle Ocho.  While there are several great places to eat Cuban food, this is the best combination of food, drinks and music in the heart of Little Havana.   \n\nThe restaurant is a small building adjacent to Domino Park.  While the building is small with a bar, stage and some 2 top seating, there is a courtyard behind with ample seating.  We got reservations for 6, largest party at 11:30 and quickly had our table.  When we were then helped by a great waitress that help us find the best things on the menu and everything was good.  As soon as we sat the meal started with mojitos, the best of our trip with a piece of cut sugar cane in them.  We then had the appetizer sampler as well as grilled octopus that was amazing.  For the main entree, I had the Tasajos with sweet plantains and it was incredible.  Everyone enjoyed the food and drink.  It was a great meal and better Cuban experience.  I highly recommend.

Matthew Q New Hope 83 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Wonderful Atmosphere, Disappointing Food Feb 2025 • couples Situated in the center of the commercial area of Little Havana neighborhood, this restaurant/bar delivers on many levels but unfortunately underperforms on food quality. There is live music in the front area where the bar is located, as well in the back area which is a semi outdoor garden. The wonderful music masks the unspectacular food which was mediocre and generally overpriced. The fried fish Cuban sandwich, a staple of the county’s cuisine, was bland and served on an unremarkable bun. The shrimp “stew” was disappointing and overpriced, the black bean soup, ordinary. Old Havana is known for its drinks, the many varieties of Mojito do not disappoint… you would be better served to go visit for a cocktail and the live music and choose one of the many restaurant options close by for lunch or dinner.

Axouss Paris 842 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Bon appetite Sep 2024 • couples In the heart of Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood is this excellent restaurant. Warm welcome by a waitress, who was attentive and courteous throughout the meal.\n\nThe setting of the restaurant is nice. Live Cuban music adds an authentic and festive touch to the atmosphere. The menu is varied.\nWe ordered dishes that were served to us quickly. \nTostones, beef were very tasty.\nVery good Cuban beer.\n\nOld’s Havana was a good experience to start over. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to discover the excellent flavors of Cuba in a friendly and warm atmosphere in Miami.

SunkistTwo Hobe Sound 176 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Calle Ocho does not disappoint: Old Havana flavors unite. Sep 2024 • friends Pick a Sunday morning, just before noon, to explore the Calle Ocho.  Choose the Old Havana Cuban Bar and Restaurant and sit in the inside courtyard for a remarkable lunch.  The staff is ready at that time of the morning with Expresso or Mohito.  The menu is extensive yet manageable and the servers are very informed for you.  There may be a guitarist strumming Latin favorites in the covered over yard.  Cuban decor abounds and perhaps a local rooster just might visit the grounds with some more color of Havana.  Cuban casseroles and seafood or sandwiches are delivered on large platters.  The Team at the bar have the beverages lined-up and ready to go. \n     Have a great pair of walking, \"or dancing\", shoes on for the rest of the sights and sounds of Calle Ocho in the best part of Miami.

Mark1Rob Townville 476 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles A Fun local restaurant with great food & service Nov 2023 • couples We went on a Wednesday for lunch Arriving about 11:30. We were seated in the back in a covered outdoor courtyard. The person who took our order was very pleasant and accommodating. We ordered the  classic mojito for our cocktail (it was the best mojito I have ever had), two chef empanadas which were filled nicely and did not  skimp on the filling. The ceviche and tamale for  appetizers also. They were both excellent. We also ordered the Cuban sandwich which was loaded and tasted wonderful. Servers would bring food as it was ready.  For dessert we had coconut flan and the tres leche. They topped off our lunch.  Service was great. Food was great. The ambience was great. We really enjoyed our visit here. Our bill was $98. As part of the bill there was a service charge of 18% which was the tip for the server. If you read the menu 100% of the service charge goes to the employees. Usually, I would have a problem with a restaurant, adding the tip on, but the service was impeccable.\n.

Nupester Jupiter 720 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Great Cuban Food, Be Wary of Tiny Sodas with no Refills, Automatic Service Charge, Crowds May 2024 • solo This is the best Cuban food I've had, period.  That's why I eat here when I'm in town, often before Miami Marlins games (as the stadium is a mile up the street).  I had the whitefish with moro rice and sweet plantains and all were outstanding as always.\n\nBut a few detractors to be aware of; the place is packed, loud, and uncomfortable.  There are no free refills on drinks; you pay $4 for a soda and they just give you a 237 mL bottle and that's it!  (Would have been cheaper at the game).  Service is typically slow because they are so busy.  AND they automatically charge you an 18% service fee so remember when you go to pay that the tip was already included.\n\nThe inside is too closely packed and uncomfortable for my tastes so I've started sitting outside.  Even in the hot Miami summer, it's comfortable outside because there is a lot of shade and they do a good job with the fans.  \n\nIf you want a quiet dinner, not the place.  If you want to get in and out with an inexpensive meal, not the place.  But if you want phenomenal authentic Cuban food, it is definitely your place!

Hammer1968 Lima 98 contributions 2 4 of 5 bubbles On a tour Apr 2024 • couples On a tour of Miami and was hungry for an authentic Cuban sandwich, unfortunately they don’t serve the Cuban until after 3:00pm, we were there for lunch. We settled for the sampler appetizers and it was very good. I’d love to go back sometime for the Cuban. I noticed some post about too many tourists in the area, I was one of them.

Ted D Miami 50 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Havana More Food Nov 2023 • friends This place is one of my go to for Cuban food and (unpopular opinion) I prefer it over Versailles. \n\nSo this place does not require reservations only and PRO TIP: it’s large enough with a big outdoor seating area (with fans - because hello MIAMI) to accommodate you. \n\nThe location starts with all the authentic vibes like a bunch of domino players just a few feet from\nThe restaurant. The fact that most nights you can catch live music. Most of the staff are Hispanic. And of course location location location in that it’s located in a historically Cuban area with other fun spots to check out. \n\nFor food: start with the Classicos\n1) empanadas \n2) Croquetas\n3) Tostones Rellenos (add the shrimp big dawg)\n4. Masitas De Cerdo Fritos (fried pork chunks)\n\nAll four starters were packed with flavor, came ready to order, and a great introduction to the main course if you make it there. \n\nFor the main course:\n1) Vaca Frita De pollo (crispy shredded roasted chicken)\n2) Lechon Asado (traditional marinated roasted pork)\n\nPro Tip: I recommend for sides to do rice and beans, sweet plantains, and you can never go wrong with fries. \n\nThe food speaks for itself because I’ve been back several times. \n\n#Havanamorefood Read more Written January 8, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Joel JZ Lake Worth 838 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Great Cuban experience Nov 2023 • friends We came late for dinner with a friend while in Downtown and drove over to one of our favorite places for the music, the fun and the great food. Katy was our server and got to use my Spanish as I would suggest if you can order in Spanish you will enjoy the experience a little better. However, everyone speaks English.  We started with the Mariqitas (banana chips) and a cuban sandwich (not the best but very good. I like a little crunch to my cuban bread. could have used another minute in the press. \nFor dinner, we ordered shrimp in oil, a Churrasco steak, and roasted pork. a side of sweet bananas, and all ordered rice and black beans. All very good and fun music in the background in the back. If you sit inside, it is great Latin music live but a little loud. If you are with folks you want to speak to, it would be hard. That is why we sat out back. Read more Written November 18, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Mel65B Chandler 83 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Fabulous lunch Feb 2023 • couples This restaurant looks tiny and packed from the street but has a huge patio area out the back door. If rain is eminent,  make sure you get a covered table.  Servers are friendly and very helpful if you are first timers eating Cuban food like we were. I got the beef with sautéed onions and my husband got the fried flank steak, both were delicious.  I  loved the sweet fried plantain, which was like a fried chunk of sweet potato. The fries are crisp and come in a little wire basket and is a good portion.  The black beans are good. We did not try the cocktails, but I had a Coke which they bring in a glass bottle and pour into a glass of ice. There is an 18% service charge, which is split among all the servers, but if you tip on top of that, your server gets to keep all of it (we tipped $10 because she was terrific). Spent about $60 before the tip. Overall, great value and delicious! Read more Written February 6, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
