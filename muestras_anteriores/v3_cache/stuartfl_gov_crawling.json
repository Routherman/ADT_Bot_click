He received his graduate degree in Public Administration (Oakland University) in 1990, and then served as an infantry and intelligence officer in the United States Army, stationed in Schweinfurt, Bavaria, Germany until 1994. He began his municipal career in Lexington, Michigan, in 1996, and successively served the communities of Linden, Michigan; Dowagiac, Michigan; Davison, Michigan; Winsted, Connecticut; and Fernandina Beach, Florida, before beginning his service to Flagler Beach in Aug, 2023.

His personal interests include playing boardgames and reading. March 21, 2025/Friday Notes As the community has been promoting all year, Flagler Beach is celebrating its centennial anniversary this year. The Town of Flagler Beach was originally incorporated in 1925 (subsequently becoming a City in 1963). Mayor Patti King is leading a committee to develop and host a series of celebratory events throughout the year, beginning with a birthday party on April 16, the same date as the Town’s incorporation. The City is offering sponsorship opportunities for the Centennial Celebrations. The sponsorship levels are Gold ($5,000), Silver ($2,500), and Bronze ($1,000). Sponsors at each level will be recognized for their support throughout the year through a variety of means: City Commission recognition, social media, City website, print, and other promotional materials. Planned events include an ice cream social, a community dinner, a return of the downtown “bed races,” a cardboard regatta, a historic scavenger hunt, and a gala dinner. The year will also be celebrated with banners on the Moody Boulevard (SR 100) bridge and other local streets; regular First Friday events and other holiday festivities; and culminate with the City’s New Year’s Eve Surfboard Drop and Fireworks. The Calendar of Events can be found on the City’s website and Facebook page. Please send your Sponsorship donation to City of Flagler Beach, ATTN: Ms. Hollie Harlan, Finance Director, 105 S. 2nd Street, Flagler Beach, FL, 32136, hharlan@cityofflaglerbeach.com. Please also provide an electronic copy of your logo so that your sponsorship can be officially recognized, along with a preferred web link to your website that can be promoted on sponsorship material.

Our Purpose Flagler constructed the Crisp-Ellert Art Museum in honor of Dr. JoAnn Crisp-Ellert and her husband, Dr. Robert Ellert. More than just a gallery space, CEAM offers Flagler College students and the Northeast Florida community a venue for fostering knowledge and a deep appreciation of contemporary art. As an educational resource for the College, the Museum exhibits regional, national, and international artists and provides opportunities for critical engagement and exposure to a variety of exhibitions and personal interactions with visiting artists. The Museum challenges students, the Flagler community, and the public to cultivate individual creativity, critical reflection, historical consciousness, and respect for the free exchange of ideas. In this spirit, the Museum also hosts public programs, including artist talks, readings, panel discussions, and film series that provide a platform for vital interdisciplinary dialogue. Learn more about our unique history and the forward thinkers who made the Crisp-Ellert Art Museum possible.
