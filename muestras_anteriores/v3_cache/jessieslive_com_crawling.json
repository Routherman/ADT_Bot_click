Or 14 as most would say. Another should have moment. Another non birthday. It’s obviously not our first rodeo. The “should haves” list continues to grow. But whilst there are more missed milestones. Your spirit continues to show. You would have totally loved this year. Watching a big brother sweat his GCSEs. Seeing celebrations at prom. An early look at how your next 2 years would be. I can hear your comments now; “When it’s my turn I’m going to do AB&C”. Always getting involved. A spirit of ‘soon it will be me’. You’d have loved the results and celebrations. The drama, excitement and reward. Being so close to your birthday, Would have been something you adored. But as part of the summer of celebrations, Today is just about you. Of getting outdoors, being mischievous and eating. Your favourite things to do. Posted on October 18, 2024 October 18, 2024 How Are You Marking the Anniversary? How are you marking the anniversary? A couple of people have asked. The date our whole world changed; The day you tragically passed. But missing you doesn’t go away. Nor do the hopes we had for you. So a specific calendar date, Doesn’t change my point of view. So how are we marking 5 years? With an acknowledgement that time feels weird. And that last time we saw you feels so real, Yet only memories have filled the last 5 years. But we treasure all memories of you , Filled with stories that I love. And I hope the message gets through, If you are watching from above. Today I hope you see us celebrating, All the things that you stood for. Starting of course with food, And sausages that you adored! A day full of bravery, Of boldness. and mischief. Because celebrating your spirit, Is way better, than wallowing in grief. Posted on August 17, 2024 August 16, 2024 8+5 – The Teen Who Could Have Been Birthdays now are a funny old thing,\nA day of celebration and sadness all heaped together.\nOf course we remember the greatness you were, \nWhilst knowing painfully we’ll miss you forever.\n\n\nBirthday memories include your delight at a 5am start,\nA party or trip with your friends.\nMuktitasking cards, gifts, visits and cake,\nMetaphorically burning the candle both ends!\n\n\nBut of course time moves on,\nYou’d be a teen at thirteen!\nSuper cool and know your own mind.\nSo perhaps we’d see a change this year,\nFrom chaos to a little more serene?\n\n\nI’m guessing of course - it’s impossible to know.\nIt’s a hunch how you’d have felt and shined.\nMemories fuse with speculation and become a big blur.\nBut your spirit lives on in my mind.\n\n\nSo whilst I fondly remember your very special day,\nAnd the magnificence of all that was “You”.\nI mourn so greatly that you never grew up,\nTo be the wonderful teen who we wish we still knew. ❤️ Posted on May 29, 2024 May 29, 2024 j.e.s.s.I.c.a. is for the London Eye So this year is our 5th year of trips without being a 5. Five years of missed experiences and adventures. That said, as is always the case, Jess is always with us in spirit, and never more so that on our name spelling trips. ’I’ this year was a tricky one….. Iceland, Ireland? Far too straight forward; far too non Jess! So in true mischief making style, this year was about the London ‘Eye’. Seeing the bright lights and buzz of London was something Jess never got to experience, so it felt fitting for her to ride up high and see it all in one go from above. As we steadily soared into the sky, we spotted plenty of famous landmarks, as well as a plethora of swanky apartments where she would have undoubtedly one day wanted to stay. We checked the flag at Buckingham palace to see if the King was in, tried to spot the 02 where we had been only the day before, tried to count the red buses and boats. It felt very much like the Where’s Wally books that Jess loved so much! It wasn’t lost on me that the trip round was over far too quickly; much the same as Jess’ time with us. And as we stepped off the wheel, Big Ben bonged 12 times – she’d have loved that; I can imagine Jess would have felt cheated by anything less! PM began (post mischief as well as the afternoon) and we wandered off past Westminster, Downing Street, Pall Mall and in search of food. Mischief making, after all, always was hungry work! Posted on October 18, 2023 October 18, 2023 Four Years Ago Today It has been four years since you’ve been gone, We miss you terribly, although we plod on. I can’t believe half your lifetime has since passed, And October 2019 was filled with our lasts. This calendar date and the exact month leading to, Contain so many memories of what you went through. But your illness was short, for that I must give thanks. Your time on this earth was mainly filled with happiness (and pranks). So instead of dwelling on this rather sombre day, I’ll try and reflect in a Jessica way. Be bold, be brave and move forward at pace, Everything you did felt like a race! If I was tell you about day to day life for us now, I’d tell you we always carry you with us, somehow. Your love of sausage sandwiches is a new family tradition, And for each significant event there’s a Jess poem addition. Your spirit is still warmly felt, and we have lots of pictures and your things, And you’re still always with me, in one of my rings. Oli’s back of martial arts, in memory of you, Your strength and your courage inspires all that we do. Team Jess have raised lots, you’ve inspired so much good, So children like you can have a childhood like they should, Fundraising has filled so many of our days, Runs, writing books and other ingenious ways. So although I can’t tell you, in person anyway, That your memories live on, every single day. If you can see us somehow, you’ll know how much we wish you were here, And how we will ALWAYS all keep you, incredibly near. Posted on September 6, 2023 September 6, 2023 j.e.s.S.i.c.a is for Espanya (a second time)! This year was our fourth year of holidays without Jess. Fourth – I can barely believe it. To honour this year’s spelling tradition, we decided the best way would be to repeat the phenomenal success of last year’s trip…. It was a double S in JESS after all! 😂 So back in Barcelona, we enjoyed all of our cosmopolitan faves from last year, together with a few new adventures too. The Barca B football match was perhaps a new highlight for all of the family, where we celebrated victory in our best Spanish with the locals. Jess would obviously have wanted a sporting shirt for the occasion (as became the tradition on our very first holiday as a family of 5), so we enjoyed choosing these with the boys too. But just to add balance, we also enjoyed a phenomenal trip up the mountains to Montserrat, where we reflected and remembered the fragility of life….  (And the Spanish mountain roads – not that that would have scared the fearless Jess!). In between, we loved all that life had to offer; the climate, the food, the environment and the company.  And whilst the lack of Jess is still incredibly palpable, I hope we’re doing justice to her memory and all she would have loved to do. Her footprints never managed to make their mark on Barcelona, but her memories and spirit were with us all the way. ❤️ Posted on August 17, 2023 August 15, 2023 Half a lifetime ago Jess Aged 4 Posted on October 18, 2022 October 18, 2022 3 Years Gone Sometimes it’s incredibly difficult to separate how you actually feel from how you think you should feel. Today is one of those days. I looked down at the concrete, Grey and cold and bare. So many times we’ve been here, But now you’re no longer there. Your 3 year ‘departversary’, And our loss feels so severe. I’ve been trying to muddle through, Behind a positive veneer. And then from out of nowhere, A rainbow reflects from the glass wall. “Mum will you STOP getting upset; I’m still with you after all! I’m with you in your heart, Although I’m not standing exactly there. I’n trying to send some signs, That I’m actually EVERYWHERE.” You know that I’d have loved that, I was so much larger than life. I always said I’m greedy , And now I’ve got an afterlife! So I’m not sad and gloomy, I want you to feel that too! Even though I was only eight, When life as we knew it was through. This rainbow that’s before you, Shows the full and vibrant life that I had. And although you miss me deeply, Please focus on all the fun. Don’t be sad.” Posted on September 18, 2022 October 5, 2022 Childhood Cancer Awareness Month September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month; a month I’m ashamed to say I didn’t know existed until exactly 3 years ago when Jess was diagnosed. Despite countless prior GP appointments, Jess’ diagnosis came as a surprise and was incredulously only a month before she passed away. I still can’t quite believe the speed and aggression of the disease. But I owe it to Jess to raise awareness of the speed and cruelness of childhood cancer and to urge everyone to incessantly push for answers if they think something isn’t quite right. Thanks @gracekelly for raising the profile. I hope sharing Jess’ story helps. https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=137656342335632&id=100082737994256&set=a.116587167775883 Posted on September 3, 2022 September 3, 2022 j.e. S. s.i.c.a. is for Espanya! So this year is our third year of holidays without Jess. To honour the uniquely created name spelling tradition, we find ourselves in the beautiful Spain, enjoying all that Barcelona has to offer. Spain was the last holiday I had with Jess, so the run up to the trip was full of mixed feelings. I think Barcelona offers plenty that Jess would have enjoyed. From the cosmopolitan vibe, to the glorious weather, delicious food, and a roof top pool with panoramic views that seem to stretch forever. Heaven! And being a mini me, she definitely would have wanted to practice the odd Spanish phrase as she enjoyed it all! So we’ve enjoyed them all to the max (for Jess as well as us). 😀 Posts navigation Page 1 Page 2 … Page 7 Next page Find Us Email: jill@teamjess.co.uk Follow us on Twitter @TeamJess_UK Jess’ Story has also been published as a book; In Our Shoes is out now, available to buy from Amazon by clicking this link .
