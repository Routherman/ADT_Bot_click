Her dedicated oversight is recognized throughout Southwest Florida and the greater arts community as an example of leadership geared toward prudent growth and relationship building. Naples Illustrated named her one of its Leading Ladies in 2016, saying, “van Bergen has led Naples’ premier cultural center to a new level.” Named one of Musical America ’s “Top 30 Professionals of the Year” in 2019, she is described as “a woman with a mission, a vision and a board to support both.” In 2022, she was named among Gulfshore Life magazine’s “Forces of Philanthropy,” a select few leaders of Southwest Florida who “propel the philanthropic community into the future through mentorship, collaboration and camaraderie.” Since 2011, Kathleen has put her focus on balancing a multidisciplinary artistic mission with strong financial performance. From the beginning of her tenure, she has made balanced budgets and operational surpluses a priority: The balance sheet has more than doubled over the last decade, and, as of 2021, the organization is debt free. In 2016, Artis—Naples announced the Future—Forward Campaign for Cultural Excellence, a Master Plan to reimagine the Kimberly K. Querrey and Louis A. Simpson Cultural Campus, embrace artistic and community initiatives, substantially increase the endowment and grow the permanent collection for The Baker Museum. By the time the campaign concluded, it had exceeded $95 million in these four key areas, and the Artis—Naples endowment has surpassed $150 million. Under Kathleen’s leadership, a variety of challenges have been met, including those brought on by Hurricane Irma in 2017 and the subsequent repair and expansion of The Baker Museum, the multi-year challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact felt by audiences following Hurricane Ian in 2022. Throughout these challenges, artistic excellence, community partnerships and growth have remained top priorities. The Baker Museum has greatly expanded its permanent collection with key acquisitions and presented numerous landmark exhibitions in conjunction with prominent artists and museums, including Isabelle de Borchgrave; Dale Chihuly; the National Portrait Gallery, London; and École des Beaux-Arts, Paris. During Kathleen’s tenure, the Naples Philharmonic has expanded in size and scope while reaching new levels of artistic achievement. Kathleen has also been instrumental in the development of numerous long-term relationships with world-renowned artists and ensembles, including Artis—Naples Artistic and Music Director Alexander Shelley and celebrated violinist and Artistic Partner James Ehnes, as well as the Vienna Philharmonic, Berliner Philharmoniker and Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, each of which made their Florida debuts this decade. In addition, Kathleen’s vision for multidisciplinary thematic planning has allowed Artis—Naples to leverage its unique resources in order to enhance patron experiences with the visual and performing arts. Kathleen has built a dynamic leadership team for Artis—Naples , recruiting senior leaders from cultural organizations around the country. She has also overseen the expansion of the organization’s offerings and multidisciplinary focus, including the acquisition of the Naples International Film Festival in 2017. The diversity of artistic excellence and world-class programming is one reason The Wall Street Journal said Artis—Naples has ushered in “an impressive new phase” for classical music in Southwest Florida. A violinist by training, Kathleen has made music a central part of her life. Prior to joining Artis—Naples , she held several key positions, including artistic and executive director at the acclaimed Schubert Club in Saint Paul, Minnesota; vice president of artistic planning for The Philadelphia Orchestra; and vice president and director of artistic administration for the St. Louis Symphony. Kathleen has served on the boards of the American Composers Forum, the Rose Ensemble, Exhibits Development Group and the Greater Naples Chamber of Commerce, and she currently serves on the board of From the Top, the Community Advisory Board of Gulfshore Life and the Eastman School of Music National Council. She holds a bachelor’s degree in violin performance from the Eastman School of Music and has completed the Tuck Executive Program at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business and the Strategic Perspectives in Nonprofit Management program at Harvard Business School. In 2022, Kathleen was a recipient of the Eastman School of Music’s Centennial Award, given in honor of its 100th year to 100 individuals who exemplify the school’s mission and legacy through their artistry, scholarship, leadership, community engagement and philanthropy.

Tomaso Albertini Medium: Oil Painting Bio Tomaso Albertini, a Milan, Italy native, obtained his B.A. from The Academy of Fine Arts and Illustration, Milano. His artistic achievements have been recognized by Sotheby's, which selected him as the face for the \"Old Masters Meet the Street\" project. His work is prominently featured in private collections and has been exhibited by esteemed galleries in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Dubai, Milan, Venice, and Turin. Tomaso has participated in prominent art fairs including Art Basel, Scope Miami, and Urban Art Fair NYC. In 2015, he relocated to New York City, where the urban landscape and energy became a primary source of inspiration. The contrast of wealth and poverty in the city profoundly influences his choice of mediums and color palettes. Tomaso Albertini adapts a distinctive and unique artistic technique, creating three-dimensional art through the assembly of cardboard sculptures on canvas, which are then complemented by his painting. This approach injects a dynamic quality into his artworks, transforming everyday materials like cardboard into potent artistic mediums. After eight years spent in New York City, Tomaso currently resides and works in Naples, Florida. Beyond his artistic pursuits, he is a vocal proponent of art's potential to drive meaningful change, using his artwork to collaborate with and support nonprofit organizations such as Rainforest Alliance, Mission Blue, and Fabien Cousteau's Ocean Learning Center.

Anderson’s works were included in Martin Kippenbergers shows at the Museum of Modern Art Paris, Cassel, Germany, Museum Beuyman’s von Beuningen, in Rotterdam Holland, and Metro Pictures Gallery, NY, NY. Her video Love, Boys and Food was shown at the New Museum in New York City, and the Queens Museum, Queens, NY.

Donna Berk Mediums: Watercolor,  Youth Art Bio As an undergraduate of Simmons College, Boston, and a graduate student of Boston College and beyond, Donna has directed much of her attention to advancing creative curriculum and methods of instruction in schools. It was an honor for her to be invited to some of the more than fifty-one countries involved in advancing a philosophy for children's programs to speak about and train teachers in this special method. Preceding her scholarly endeavors, she enjoyed designing and manufacturing handbags and accessories, curating art exhibitions, and writing editing, and translating foreign language artist’s texts for publication. She also studied sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts School, Boston and watercolor privately with an inspiring teacher, Alexi Neyman. In 2017, she moved to Naples, Florida and re-focused her attention once again to her true passion, creating art.

Mediums include acrylic paint, acrylic ink, acrylic skins, alcohol ink, resin, and texture gels. Methods encompass fluid art styles, brushwork, and the use of palette knives and tools for texture. Her inspiration comes from nature, emotions, or an emotion she wants the viewer to feel when looking at the art. Her new series focuses on tactile art for public and healthcare spaces so that the viewer can both see and touch the art safely. Combining her expertise in Dementia education with art has provided unique insight into how art is seen and appreciated by the viewer.

Holly Jones Mediums: Ceramics Bio A scientist and artist, Holly’s works draw from her experiences immersed in Florida’s wildest settings. She combines elements of Florida’s rich natural history (going back millions of years) to our current events (clay from Hurricane Ian). Jones’ ceramic works combine fossils, indigenous clays that she collects here in south Florida, and frequent interactions with our diverse wildlife.  Her functional wares are beautiful moments preserved on high fire stoneware. A fine art major in college, Holly Jones fell in love with geology and became a research scientist and adjunct professor at Indiana University and FGCU in Fort Myers. She earned a Bachelor of Art in Geology and a master’s in public Affairs. She’s a trained naturalist, an arborist, a master gardener & a chef. A farm kid at heart, her skills range from things like working with dogs and horses, growing, and preserving delicious food, welding, baking bread, hunting fossils & making things. In summer, she enjoys traveling to see her daughter and sailing on Lake Michigan. She has a passion for learning and loves to see people (and things) thrive. Working in clay combines her true loves: earth minerals, creating forms, playing in the mud, growing community, and fires. Genie Kell Medium: Watercolor, Oil, Acrylic, Collage, Mixed Media Bio Genie’s Master of Arts degree from New York University and Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from John Herron Art Institute are complemented by undergraduate study at Yale and Columbia Universities and training at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Genie has lived and exhibited her art in Athens, Greece, and on the Aegean islands of Mykonos and Santorini, and, in Venice, Italy, while completing her master’s degree there.

Genie’s upcoming workshop, Venice: The Veneto & the 2024 Biennale, is scheduled for that autumn and will include Venice in addition to excursions to Ravenna, Padua, Palladian palazzi and other historic sites along Italy’s east coast as well as in-depth study of the international, contemporary art featured in Venice’s renown biennial exhibition. In all her classes and workshops, while Genie is introducing new ways of thinking about art, encouraging the use of new techniques, and serving as a conduit for art methods and information, her focus is on encouraging each artist to pursue and embrace these four elements that ensure success as an artist: • Confidence in the artist’s own acquired skills and innate talents. • Connection with other artists and with all forms of artistic expression. • Passion for the materials and processes of art making. • Concept reflecting the artist’s own unique perspective. Richard Kirk Medium: Oil, Acrylic Bio Richard Kirk is an oil painter living and teaching in Naples and Bonita Springs, Florida. His current paintings are figurative and photorealistic, but he has worked extensively as an illustrator, portrait painter and still life painter.

His illustration clients included Hoods Milk, Dexter Shoes, Fidelity Investment, RGA Publishing and Harvard Magazine, to name a few. In addition, Richard has written and self-published four books designed to help his students learn the basics of drawing, painting, portrait painting and color theory. His fundamental belief about painting shapes his work and his teaching: “Creating a painting does not make one an artist. Artists create something extraordinary from their experience, knowledge and ability. Until a painter has discovered and is able to pull instantly from these three primary conditions, he or she is a student. Still, taking pride in being a student moves you closer to creating art.” Tracy Kuzminsky Medium: Watercolor Bio Tracy V. Kuzminsky is native to New England, but her path has brought her throughout the nation. Currently, she resides in Florida and Georgia. Tracy's undergraduate work was completed at Rhode Island College. Her studies were multifaceted, with pottery and three dimensional clay form as the cornerstone. The nucleus of her later graduate studies at Georgia State University was painting and mixed media work. Tracy's love of the artistic process led her to become a visual arts educator, which she has enjoyed for the past twenty years with great accomplishment. She has often been recognized in her field and was even awarded Georgia Art Teacher of the Year in 2012 by the Georgia Art Education Association. Tracy is now focusing more of her time and energy into her own art but she continues to enjoy teaching both youth and adult classes at Naples Art in Naples, Florida. Tracy's diverse studies, commitment to excellence, and exposure to multiple regions inspire exciting collections that explore varied media and subjects. Rebecca Matarazzi Medium: Ceramics Bio Using a variety of techniques in clay, my objective is to produce pieces for utilitarian purposes that convey a sense of tradition while allowing new concepts and ideas to develop. I get inspiration from the natural environment, creating designs for the home and kitchen that are pleasing both visually and tactilely. My teaching style is to observe each student and assess their individual needs in perfecting our craft. With a BS in Ceramics, Penn State University, I spend my days working in my pottery studio, using the Florida sun to hasten drying while fresh pieces await their first firing! Sebastian Melendez Mediums: Youth Art Bio Monique Olsen Mediums: Acrylic, Mixed Media Bio Monique Olsen is a visual artist based in Southwest Florida, raised abroad in Central America, and born in Chicago, Illinois, and profoundly influenced her understanding of art, culture, and color.

Marjorie Pesek Medium: Collage Bio Marjorie Pesek created and perfected her unique technique of Layered Imagery for over 28 years. Throughout her career, she has created inspirational works for collectors in Europe and throughout the United States, as well as for Disney World and Warner Brothers. Layered Imagery is Marjorie’s technique where she hand-assembles hundreds of photographic images into a single detailed work of art. Each piece takes several intensive weeks to create, a passionate process of making sense out of chaos. At first glance the portrait appears to be an oil painting until one gets closer to discover hidden images, often those of the subject itself or other beloved pets or family members. The interaction brings a sense of joy and pride to the collector and viewer. The majority of Marjorie’s work are commissioned portraits of people, dogs, cats, horses and landscapes. “Many of my collectors say that to live with an original art piece of mine is to see something different in it each time they look at it.” Susan Reynolds Medium: Ceramics Bio Growing up with midwestern roots, Susan Reynolds remembers being surrounded by the influence of the Arts & Crafts movement. From art to architecture, color to design, the impressions stayed with her and ultimately showed up in what she collected and created. Brief summers lakeside in northern Wisconsin provided the connections to nature that are revealed in her current work. Reynolds’ work is primarily wheel-thrown but recently she branched out into hand-building. She begins with perfectly symmetrical pieces that provide the blank canvas on which to work. The rims, edges and surfaces are then altered with tools and brushes but mostly, with her hands. The “manipulated edge” pieces end up like her; imperfectly perfect. Reynolds received a BS in Art at UW Madison but spent 25 years in e-Commerce. After leaving the corporate world in 2019 she rediscovered her love of clay. She opened Longford Road Ceramics in 2020 as a full-time working artist. Ana B. Roca Medium: Oil, Acrylic Bio Ana B Roca is a native of Colombia, she is also an educator, an artist, and a mother.  After graduating from Brooklyn College, New York, with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Fine Arts she moved to Italy to study Art.

Ana is passionate about sharing her knowledge of art history and painting techniques of the old and modern masters. She teaches English to non-English speaking students in a public middle-grade school here in Naples where she lives and enjoys its beauty and weather. Dawn Smith Mediums: Youth Art Bio Dawn’s LEGO Art Studio is an original approach to exposing students to concepts in art, math, engineering, and science in a way that is enjoyable and meaningful to them.  The program was first realized 8 years ago while Dawn was working as a volunteer at a Title 1 school in Southern California.  Her original goal was to start a LEGO Robotics program at the school, but she quickly realized that such a program would exclude most students due to cost.  Utilizing her formal training in Early Childhood Education, she planned a LEGO based afterschool enrichment program for elementary students.  After selling the idea to the school’s principal and wrangling a few other parent volunteers, LEGO club was launched.  Every student that wanted to participate was accepted.  “LEGO” met three times per week for 2 hours, 30-35 students per meeting, accommodating over 100 students. Dawn holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from California State University, Northridge and an Associate of Science in Early Childhood Education from Cerro Coso Community College.  She has four children and four grandchildren.  She relocated with her family to Southwest Florida 5 years ago and currently works full-time in the hospitality industry. Ted Streppa Mediums: Stained Glass Bio Ted Streppa is a native of Rochester, New York and a graduate of Colgate University and Cornell Law School. After his retirement, he took up mosaics as a hobby and later stained glass art. Bitten by the glass bug, Ted devoted his free time to classes, allowing him to expand his knowledge of the medium and refine his techniques. Ted and his wife moved to Naples in 2015 where he continued his glass art work and has since taken up making jewelry. Teaching classes at local art centers and outreach workshops for Naples Art’s community partners has brought Ted great joy in providing one-on-one instruction to students. His unique glass creations are sold at local art fairs and the Naples Art gift shop, Originals, for which Ted designed and crafted the colorful stained glass sign that hangs above its door. Ann Sullivan Mediums: Bio Ann Sullivan was born and reared in New York City where she taught Biology at Andrew Jackson High School after graduating from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

As an art historian trained in 19th-century European academic art and knowledgeable in Pan-American modern and contemporary art, he has curated and organized more than 100 exhibitions, most notably Surrealism in Belgium: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (2014), The Duchamp Family of Artists (2014), and Museum to Scale 1/7 (2015). Originally from Brussels, Verpoorten moved to New York City in 2000, where he held curatorial and directorial roles at the Dahesh Museum of Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. From 2009 to 2012 he was Cultural Attaché for the Delegation of Flanders (Belgium) to the U.S.A. in New York. Before joining Naples Art Institute, he was Director and Chief Curator of Artis—Naples, The Baker Museum for seven years, earning the appreciation, support, and friendship of the Southwest Florida community through unique, world-class exhibitions, tireless advocacy for the permanent collection, and judicious acquisitions. He propelled the institution to a new level of excellence and substantially grew and advanced the appreciation of the museum’s collections. He expanded the collection by securing major acquisitions from the late Olga Hirshhorn and from Charlotte and Paul Corddry. His research on The Baker Museum’s collection culminated with the publication of their first permanent collection book. In 2019, Verpoorten secured a long-term loan of six iconic paintings by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte from a private collection. The addition of these outstanding works with remarkable provenance substantially raised the museum’s profile nationally and internationally. Mr. Verpoorten attended the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Belgium, earning dual master’s degrees in art history and cultural studies. frank.verpoorten@naplesart.org | 239.262.6517 Jack Decloedt Senior Director of Operations Bringing his experience in managing several businesses to Naples Art Institute, Jack strives for operational excellence and financial stability in support of the Institute’s plan to become Naples’ cultural and educational focal point for the visual arts.

Upon selling that company, he took on the position of VP and General Manager of a local sign manufacturer, helping to establish it as Southwest Florida’s largest. Jack’s passion for education, culture and arts is shown in his extensive volunteer work with a Florida university, assisting with the development and installation of numerous art exhibitions as well as the design and implementation of a newly-built museum. jack.decloedt@naplesart.org | 239.262.6517 Ext. 115 Jenn Doherty Director of Marketing & Communications Jenn is a seasoned marketing and communications professional with a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University.
