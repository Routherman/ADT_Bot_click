Wanda Cole-Frieman, Cohort 2 The ecosystem of supporters that BCBR assembled is deeply inspiring. It's so hard to build a community like this, especially so quickly. It underscores the level of commitment the founders invested in BCBR from the outset that so many Black leaders and executives have been willing to show up and contribute.

An endowment fund has now been established with an initial goal of $10M to ensure accompaniment of the BCBR community in perpetuity. Barry Lawson Williams served on 14 public company boards and created the Black Corporate Directors Time Capsule Project to capture the corporate board experiences of 50 seasoned Black directors for the benefit of new and aspiring Black corporate directors.

Our Story How It All Began The Black Corporate Board Readiness (BCBR) program, co-founded by Thane Kreiner and Dennis Lanham in 2020, emerged in response to structural inequities and the need for greater diversity in corporate governance. Guided by experienced corporate directors, BCBR was designed to support and prepare talented executives for the unique challenges of board service. The program quickly gained traction, exceeding initial expectations and fostering a growing community of board-ready talent. Learn More about BCBR's History Frequently Asked Questions Expand all items + What does the Black Corporate Board Readiness Program (BCBR) do? BCBR works to increase Black representation on corporate boards across the United States. Expand all items + Why was the BCBR founded? More capital flows through corporations than through governments, making corporate governance crucial to wide-ranging economic and societal impact. Research has shown that increased board diversity—in terms of gender, race, economic level, lived experience, and more—leads to measurably better business outcomes. And diversity starts at the top. Even so, more than one-third of S&P 500 companies lacked even one Black board member as recently as 2019, and only 4% of Russell 3000 board directors are Black. Addressing that problem is why the BCBR was founded. Learn more about BCBR's history → Expand all items + How are BCBR participants chosen? The program is open to executives from all backgrounds and identities who have gained extensive senior leadership experience or an equivalent span of control, including as a CEO or general manager. From among qualified executives nationwide who apply, up to 35 participants are selected per cohort. Expand all items + What happens during a BCBR program? We launch every cohort with a welcome reception, where participants are introduced to the BCBR community, including mentors, advisors, and alumni. After the reception, the cohort will engage in six virtual sessions—two on Thursdays and four on Fridays. On the final session date, there will be a virtual certificate ceremony, where you will receive both a digital certificate and a badge recognizing your completion of the program. After the cohort concludes, participants may have the opportunity to attend additional workshops hosted by our program partners, if available. Expand all items + What makes BCBR different or special? People with lived experience as sitting directors and subject matter experts are responsible for creating and presenting the program curriculum, along with providing personalized mentorship to each BCBR Participant. More than courses and book-learning, BCBR includes attention to the intangibles that board members must navigate. BCBR is hosted by a sponsoring university, Santa Clara University, built on Jesuit principles, including a commitment to social justice. The program was formed and launched with speed and dedication. The co-founders followed up immediately on every potential connection and got the first cohort up and running quickly. The BCBR co-founders think big, believing that changing corporate governance can help change the world for the better. Expand all items + Who are the founders of the BCBR, and what are their backgrounds? BCBR was co-founded by Thane Kreiner, PhD, and Dennis Lanham. Thane is a board member, co-founder, and independent advisor with 27+ years’ experience leading systemic change to improve health and wellness for people and the planet. He served for a decade as executive director of Santa Clara University’s Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship, which transformed under his direction into the world’s leading university-based accelerator of social enterprises. Before that, he started four life sciences ventures and served as president and CEO of DNA chip industry pioneer Affymetrix. He earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin, a doctoral degree in neurosciences from Stanford University School of Medicine, and an MBA from Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Dennis is senior assistant dean and executive director of the Leavey Executive Center at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. He has built several dozen high-impact executive and professional development programs and universities across the United States. He earned a bachelor’s degree in applied behavior analysis from the University of North Texas, a master’s degree in higher education and higher education administration from the Florida State University College of Education, and an MBA in international business from Georgia State University’s J. Jack Robinson College of Business. Expand all items + What prompted these two white men to found the BCBR? Through their mutual ties to Santa Clara University, a Jesuit university located in the heart of Silicon Valley, California, they first became colleagues, then close friends. They found that they shared a passion for fostering a more just, humane, and sustainable world, as well as an abiding belief that collective action is essential to effect social justice. They recognized that the underrepresentation of Black leaders on boards was not due to a lack of qualified professionals. Many talented individuals from all backgrounds have the education, credentials, and skills needed for leadership roles in corporate boardrooms and executive suites. Dennis had experience building SCU’s Women’s Corporate Board Readiness (WCBR) program, launched in 2019, to increase the representation of women in corporate board roles. In early 2020, he and Thane began exploring a similar program at SCU to support more diverse leaders in securing board positions. After the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, they committed to turning the BCBR program into a reality, guided by the principles that had made WCBR successful. Learn more about BCBR's history → Expand all items + How did the co-founders approach the formation of the BCBR? Thane and Dennis began by reaching out to leaders in their professional and personal networks to learn directly from the community that the BCBR program would ultimately serve. Thane’s network drew from his extensive experience in Silicon Valley and included mentors from Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship, Stanford business school classmates, venture capital and private equity firm partners, and executive recruiters. Dennis looked to both his personal and professional networks—which, due to the fact that he was raised in a predominantly Black community, comprised a large number of Black professionals—as well as champions within SCU, including the WCBR network. On June 30, 2020 Shellye Archambeau, an experienced CEO whose board memberships include Verizon, Nordstrom, and Okta, responded to a blind communication from Dennis on LinkedIn requesting advice on the program concept. She was preparing for the launch of her book, Unapologetically Ambitious , and referred Thane and Dennis to Robin Washington—a high-powered CFO and board member at companies including Alphabet, Honeywell, and SalesForce—who agreed to an exploratory conversation. Following that conversation, Robin introduced Thane and Dennis to Barry Lawson Williams, a board member of Management Leadership for Tomorrow and creator of the Black Corporate Directors Time Capsule Project. Barry eagerly supported BCBR and introduced them to Ken and Caretha Coleman and numerous other corporate directors, many of whom said, “If Barry is in, I’m in.” By the end of August, Thane and Dennis had engaged with dozens of corporate directors, who encouraged them to move forward with the BCBR program. Learn more about BCBR's history → Expand all items + Does BCBR have an advisory committee? Yes. In September 2020, Thane and Dennis formed a BCBR Program Advisory Council (PAC) to guide on strategy and help hone the program design. The PAC includes Robin Washington, Barry Williams, Caretha Coleman, Mark Goodman, Matrice Ellis-Kirk, and Almaz Negash. Expand all items + When did the BCBR launch? The first cohort of BCBR launched in February 2021, in honor of Black History month. The inaugural cohort was oversubscribed (the initial goal was to reach at least half capacity of 25 for the first cohort) with 28 Black executives. Learn more about BCBR's history → Expand all items + How many participants were graduated during BCBR’s first year? In the first 12 months of the BCBR program, 82 participants were graduated from three cohorts. A fourth cohort was graduated early in the second year of the program, and additional cohorts continue to be recruited and scheduled. Expand all items + How is BCBR success measured? With encouragement from the BCBR PAC, the co-founders set the ambitious outcome metric of 100% placement for program alums within 12 months of program completion. In less than a year, more than 60% of inaugural cohort members had secured public or private corporate board seats Expand all items + Is anything done to match BCBR graduates with board positions? From the outset of program planning, the co-founders recognized that accomplishing their board placement goals required helping the concentration of talented leaders being graduated from the program to find appropriate public or private corporate board director positions. Expand all items + What are the future plans for the BCBR? The founders, PAC, and everyone involved with the BCBR is committed to continue expanding the program until achieving its goal of widespread authentic corporate board diversity throughout the nation.
