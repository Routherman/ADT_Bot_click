Sky News looks at why and how the day is marked. Tuesday 22 April 2025 11:42, UK Image: A drone view of a large-scale land art piece for Earth Day in Hebden Bridge. Pic: Reuters Why you can trust Sky News Earth Day is celebrating its 55th anniversary this year. The environmental event is marked by an estimated one billion people across more than 190 countries, according to the Earth Day Organisation. But what actually is Earth Day and why should we care about it? When is Earth Day and is there a theme? Earth Day is celebrated annually on 22 April. This year's theme is \"Our Power, Our Planet\", with campaigners calling on \"everyone to unite around renewable energy\" to help triple clean electricity by 2030. Helping to outline the movement's goals, Denis Hayes, the organiser of the very first Earth Day, said: \"For years we have been fed the lie that only fossil fuels can power the planet, that is not true. \"By the 2030's, the largest source of electricity generation on the planet will be solar power.\" Kathleen Rogers, president of the Earth Day Organisation, added: \"We need people power to support the big switch to renewable energy. \"We encourage everyone to talk to your local mayor, boss, neighbors, community leaders, and local and national legislators, to explore and to champion switching to renewables.\" Last year, the theme was \"Planet vs Plastics\", with campaigners pushing for a 60% reduction in the production of plastics by 2040. When did Earth Day first begin? Earth Day is a concept first brought about by Gaylord Nelson, a politician and environmentalist who served as a senator and governor in the United States . The senator had many concerns about the damaged environment in the US, including the large oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, in 1969. Follow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here He was also inspired by student anti-war protests and their passion for change during the Vietnam War, as well as the impacts the conflict had on spending priorities in the country. In the hope of expanding public awareness about air and water pollution , Senator Nelson led environmental teach-ins on campuses across the country - backed by activist Denis Hayes and co-chair Pete McCloskey. Image: Gaylord Nelson speaking before the first Earth Day. Pic: Screenshot from Nelson Institute 'If our cities don't work, America won't work' The first Earth Day was marked in 1970 and became a huge success, with 20 million people participating nationwide in the US. At the time, people took part by demonstrating in parks, streets and auditoriums against oil spills, power plants, sewage, toxic dumps, loss of wilderness and more. The first Earth Day also came at a time when a wave of legislation was being passed in the US, including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act - the next 10 years were seen as the \"environmental decade\" because of such measures and the focus on green issues. Speaking to a crowd in Milwaukee before the first climate event, Senator Nelson said: \"I don't think there's any other issue, viewed in its broadest stance, which is as critical to mankind, as the issue of the quality of the environment in which we live.\" During that first Earth Day speech, Senator Nelson added the \"environment is all of America and its problems\". He highlighted the environmental problem was heightened by the government spending billions of dollars on the war in Vietnam . Senator Nelson argued the government should have invested back into the US instead. He said the US was a country that was \"decaying, crowded, congested, polluted\". Inspired and determined to make a difference, Senator Nelson added: \"If our cities don't work, America won't work.\" Image: Anti-war protesters marched in New York city in 1970. Pic: AP Earth Day goes global In 1990, Earth Day became a global event with 200 million people and 141 countries participating. During that year, the event also helped boost recycling efforts worldwide and in 1992, it paved the way for the United Nations Earth Summit. In 1995, former US President Bill Clinton awarded Senator Nelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his role as the Earth Day founder. Image: United Nations Earth Summit opening ceremony in 1992. Pic: AP How can people participate? The Earth Day Network says the day is to mark the importance of dedicating time, resources, and energy to solving the climate crisis. There are many ways to participate, and the movement says these are actions that can be taken all year round, rather than just on the day: Educate - It says anyone, whether they are an educator, student, faith leader, or general member of the public, can learn the facts, spread awareness, and inspire action Advocate - You can write to your political leaders, sign petitions and demand action in the name of the movement Mobilise - The group suggests joining or organising town halls and rallies in your local community Pledge - It says you can pledge your support on social media and encourage others to get involved.

They commonly want to hear and see what similar companies are doing and how they are doing it, as the featured speakers are all practitioners , people who do the real job day by day. What attendees are looking for is the consistency in terms of the relevancy of content and the highest standards of facilities (venue arrangements, conference room, catering, pastime activities). Share Information Sharing and more importantly GETTING information you need to stay up-to-date with latest trends, best-practices and overall business outlook for the near future. Have Fun Often neglected (or shall we say not emphasized enough) aspect of business conferences - the after hours, the time spent outside the conference room. In a Word Concept & delivery Practitioners Event The event features speakers & panelists from the business environment, mostly from large multinational corporations and from SMEs. Weâre not hosting academia or non-profit orgâs, as we simply donât find this type of content relevant to the business world. All the featured individual talks showcase concrete, real-world examples of actual work, actual projects. Panel-discussions are designed to debate current industry trends, best-practices and give insight into how successful companies go about Product Management. Seating The main conference hall is set-up with large round tables, so that attendees can feel comfortable sitting at an actual table instead rows of chairs. People like when they can bring in a coffee and snack or place their phone/laptop on a table. This type of seating ensures a great working atmosphere inside the room. Stage & Delivery Style There is actually no elevated âstageâ or âpodiumâ, as we encourage speakers to freely roam around the conference room and communicate with the audience at all times. We find this type of delivery style to be much more engaging, as audience is not separated from the speaker. Also, the conference hall has glass walls, allowing for the natural light to penetrate the room. Again, we find this type of set-up preferable to âtheatreâ where the audience sits in the dark, while a spotlight illuminates the speaker. The 3 WHY's The story behind this conference Why PRODUCT MANAGEMENT? Because to the best of our knowledge (and we're good at our thing) there is no other large scale international business event, dedicated to the topic of Product Management, in this part of Europe. So, we're filling that market gap and YOUR NEED, until others decide to try and replicate what we do. Weâre looking forward to that challenge. Why NOW? Late April is a great time, both in terms of business schedules and weather. We could hardly pick a better date. Why OPATIJA? Well why not!! Seriously? Opatija, the Queen of the Adriatic Coast , the gem, the pinnacle, the THE place to be when you're coming to a business event at a 5â hotel. Opatija combines the natural beauty of the Adriatic, with the charm of the Old World Europe dating back to Emperor Franz Joseph I, with state-of-the-art events facilities and Michelin star gastronomy. It's in the class of its own. There is simply no other place like it. Oh and BTW - it's close. It's just several hours drive from Munich, Milan, Vienna or Budapest. So again - why not. The 3 WHAT's The benefits of attending this conference Powerful Personalities of People Who Present (aka Great Speakers) We feature speakers from across Europe and beyond, from various industries and with a wealth of experience. Moreover, we carefully select them and prep them, so they don't just present exceptional content, but they actually deliver an audience engaging performance. Transparency of Issues (aka Relevant Content) Great Speakers matter, but the content matters just as much. It's not just who is saying something, but also WHAT they are saying and how open they are about the challenges, issues and problems they've been facing. We make sure that presented content is RELEVANT to the audience and doesn't end up being a mere product-demo or a sales-pitch. Intimacy of the Conversations (aka Great Networking) The difference between a 2,000 people event and a 200 attendees event is best demonstrated outside the conference room, during breaks. At the former, you randomly bump into people; let's face it - that's not networking. At the latter, the size of the group is compact enough that \"everyone gets to know everybody else\" in 2 days. That's the intimacy of the conversation that ensures the QUALITY networking. The 3 WHO's People at this conference PRODUCT People Naturally, the primary focus group of this conference are people who are involved in the entire life-cycle of the Product. From Product Specialists and Product Owners to Product Managers and Senior Product Managers, with product Marketing Managers and Directors and VPs of Products, all the way up to the Chief Product Officer. PROJECT People Projects are the primary vehicle of delivering Products, hence there's no successful Product (Management) without Project Management. Expect to meet a lot of Project Managers among attendees. BUSINESS People Leaders Last but not least, a major gathering like this is a magnet for C-suite, so expect to see a significant number of CEOs and other Senior Execs among the crowd.

When we started seeing accessibility as a shared responsibility across teams, it became clear that itâs not just one personâs job or limited to a single department. Itâs essential for every project, whether new or existing. Using the right tools and best practices helped streamline our processes, but the biggest lesson we learned was the power of empathy. Stepping into the shoes of diverse users showed us that accessibility isnât just about compliance; itâs about creating experiences that truly work for everyone. Ultimately, accessibility is an ongoing journey. In our talk, you'll learn how to make sure that every product you build puts inclusivity at the core. Key take-aways: : 1.

In this talk, Iâll share the Delight Grid framework Iâve developed to help product teams go beyond functional features and create moments of deep delight.

Theyâve read the books, followed the frameworks, and built the roadmaps. But in a 0â1 startup, those playbooks donât workâbecause there is no road yet. Startups donât need traditional Product Managers. They need Product Builders. Forget the frameworks â In 0â1, youâre not managing a backlog; youâre figuring out what should even be built. Thereâs no data to analyze, no predictable users, and no certaintyâonly hypotheses to test. Speed beats perfection â Many PMs optimize for efficiency and process. But in a startup, those things slow you down. The real job is learning fast, iterating even faster, and embracing chaos. Less strategy, more execution â A 0â1 PM is not just a decision-maker but a doer. They jump into user interviews, hack together prototypes, and validate assumptions before a single line of code is written. They donât just track metrics â they chase insights. So, if youâre working in product and wondering why what youâve read doesnât match reality, itâs because 0â1 is a different sport. The question is: are you playing by the right rules? Key take-aways: : 1. Traditional PM Playbooks Donât Work in 0â1. In 0â1, thereâs no roadmap because the road doesnât exist yet. 2. The focus should be on speed, adaptability, and discovery, not optimizing for efficiency or scale. 3. 0â1 PMs Are Builders, Not Just Strategists. They are in the trenches and they are willing to get their hands dirty. Location: Main Conference Hall 12:30 - 13:30 Lunch Engage in a casual chat with speakers and your fellow delegates.

What does product actually mean in insurance? 3. What are we fighting and who is winning?

Reading for fun is the single biggest indicator that a child will grow up to enjoy a happier and more successful life – more than their family circumstances, their parents’ educational backgrounds or their income. But here’s the challenge : It’s at an all-time low, with only 1 in 3 children now saying they enjoy reading. We believe children are more likely to read if they enjoy it, so we’re on a mission to encourage them to see reading as an entertaining, social and fun thing to do. We want more children to grow up with a life-long, life-changing habit of reading for fun, and all the benefits this brings. Our strategy The strategy has been developed following conversations with a range of World Book Day’s stakeholders; publishers, bookshops, schools, libraries, other literacy and reading charities. View our strategy Our approach We’ve explored the research and spoken to children to ensure our work supports developing a reading for fun habit. Here you can find the 6 ways you can support the children in your lives to find the fun in reading. Our impact Our mission is to promote reading for fun, offering every child and young person the opportunity to have a book of their own. Our charity operates in the UK and Ireland. Who we work with We work with a range of different organisations who help support our mission including publishers, commercial organisations, charities and not for profits and more.

Reading time 14 minute read Author Kirsti Lang Senior Content Writer @ Buffer Create a post in Buffer Share on Threads Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on X (Twitter) Share on Reddit If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. OK, that’s a little dramatic — but a little planning ahead will go a long way in helping you map out your social media content for the coming months. My favorite way to start some content planning? Mapping out all the year's key dates and holidays. That’s where this hefty list comes in. It covers monthly themes, major international and U.S. holidays, and fun ‘national celebration’ dates — National Dress Up Your Pet Day, anyone? Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go through this list and mark dates that might impact or resonate with your customers or audience in your social media calendar. This practice is a great first step for both businesses and creators alike. Even if you don’t already have some fully fleshed-out social post ideas for the occasions, don’t sweat — just noting these dates is a great start. Inspiration might strike closer to the time. Plus, I’ve included some additional context and ideas on some key dates to help get your creative juices flowing! It’s also a good idea to note times like U.S. Thanksgiving, or European summer holidays, when audiences might be less inclined to be online. At Buffer, we tend to pause our content calendars over slower periods like this — and it’s healthy to take a break every now and again. While we’re at it: do you have an efficient social media calendar to help you plan the year ahead? If not, you might want to check out our guide to creating your own social media content calendar from scratch or even grab one of our free social media calendar templates so you can hit the ground running. Alright then — calendar at the ready? Here’s a month-by-month breakdown of holidays and observances to bookmark. 🌴 Schedule your content ahead of time so you can take a break!

Host a “Desk Glow-Up Challenge” and encourage followers to share before-and-after photos. Share a time-lapse video of the process of cleaning your desk — don’t forget the ASMR ambient sound!

March 21: World Down Syndrome Day March 22: Earth Hour March 23: National Puppy Day March 31: International Transgender Day of Visibility April 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events Stress Awareness Month National Poetry Month 📅 Key dates April 1: April Fools’ Day Dating back to the 16th century, this day is all about pranks and light-hearted fun. On social media, brands often participate by sharing funny fake announcements or playful content. Humor humanizes your brand and boosts engagement. However, it’s essential to keep jokes light-hearted and avoid anything that might confuse or alienate your audience. Content ideas: Ask followers to share the best (or worst) prank they’ve ever played. Post a meme or clip about skepticism about everything you see online today. Let’s start with the obvious: Announce a fictional product or feature that aligns humorously with your brand. Here is one of my favorites from 2024, when UK gym chain Gymbox ‘launched’ Gymbarks classes for dogs. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gymbox (@gymboxofficial) April 5: National Self Care Day April 7: World Health Day April 10: National Siblings Day April 16: World Semicolon Day April 18: Good Friday April 20: Easter Sunday April 22: Earth Day April 28: Pay It Forward Day Inspired by the concept of passing on good deeds, this global event encourages acts of kindness to create a ripple effect. This celebration can foster positivity and community engagement — and also an opportunity to showcase your brand’s values. Content ideas: Share a story of how a small act of kindness made a big difference. Challenge your audience: “Perform one kind act today and share it with us!” Partner with a nonprofit to highlight their initiatives. April 25: National DNA Day April 30: Adopt a Shelter Pet Day May 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events National Barbecue Month Lupus Awareness Month Cannes Film Festival (May 13–24) 📅 Key dates May 4: Star Wars Day “May the Fourth be with you,” a pun on the famous Star Wars quote, has transformed into an annual celebration of the beloved franchise. Star Wars has a global fanbase spanning generations, making this a fun and engaging content opportunity. Content ideas: “If you could have one Jedi power, what would it be?” Use Star Wars imagery to tie into your brand (e.g., “Social media management as easy as using The Force!”). Post memes or trivia about the franchise. May 5: Cinco de Mayo May 8: World Ovarian Cancer Day May 10: National Small Business Day May 11: Mother’s Day (U.S.) May 20: World Bee Day May 26: Memorial Day (U.S.) May 31: World No-Tobacco Day June 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events Pride Month June celebrates the LGBTQ+ community, commemorating the Stonewall Uprising of 1969. Pride Month is about visibility, equality, and support for LGBTQ+ rights. Pride Month fosters inclusivity, kindness, and support. It’s a time to amplify LGBTQ+ voices. 💡 If creating content for this month, remember to keep the spotlight firmly focused on the LGBTQ+ community , rather than co-opting the occasion by showcasing how great your brand is. Businesses that preach support for LGBTQ+ communities but have no policies and practices that support LGBTQ+ employees internally will be seen as dishonest and disingenuous. More on this in the Juneteenth section down below. Content ideas: Highlight LGBTQ+ creators, employees, or businesses. Share a post explaining the history and significance of Pride. Post messages of inclusivity and support using Pride colors. Launch a Pride-themed product or initiative, with proceeds benefiting LGBTQ+ organizations. Men’s Health Week (June 10–16) 📅 Key dates June 3: World Bicycle Day June 14: Flag Day June 15: Father’s Day June 18: International Sushi Day June 19: Juneteenth (U.S.) Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, specifically the announcement of freedom in Texas on June 19, 1865. Recognized as a federal holiday, Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom and African American culture. It’s also an opportunity to educate and honor history. I shared this in our 2024 calendar guide and want to highlight it again here: It’s important to note that Juneteenth — like many other important dates on this list — should not be seen as a marketing opportunity to exploit. Brands have been called out for not practicing what they preach for celebrating the holiday in their marketing materials while having no policies and practices that support Black employees internally or the Black community more broadly. “It is a holiday that marks the end of 200+ years of slavery, bondage, and abuse of African Americans,” multicultural marketing expert Lizette Williams pointed out in an interview with Forbes in 2022 . “It is a celebration of resilience — not a marketing moment, carefully crafted social media post, or latest African American-targeted innovation drop.” Rather than a performative marketing campaign, Williams suggests diverting these resources. “Support Black-owned businesses or organizations such as Black Girls Code , Loveland Foundation , and others to help in the continuous fight for racial justice, equality, and equity,” she suggested. 💡 Here’s a brilliant article by small business owner Nyshell Lawrence, on how she meaningfully supports causes that matter to her through her business, Socialight Society. Content ideas: Share posts on the history and significance of Juneteenth. Highlight Black-owned businesses or creators or partner with organizations supporting racial equality and justice. June 20: Summer Solstice June 21: International Yoga Day June 21: National Selfie Day A fun celebration of self-expression, National Selfie Day encourages people to share their best selfies. User-generated content (UGC) thrives on this day, and brands can tap into trends by encouraging engagement and showcasing their audience. Content ideas: Run a selfie challenge: “Show us how you use [product/service].” Don’t forget to include prizes! Share your team’s selfies with captions like “Meet the faces behind the brand!” Post tips for taking the perfect selfie. June 30: Social Media Day July 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events National Ice Cream Month National Grilling Month 📅 Key dates July 1: International Joke Day July 2: Made in the USA Day July 4: Independence Day (U.S.) July 13: Embrace Your Geekness Day July 17: National Tattoo Day July 17: World Emoji Day Created in 2014, this day celebrates the growing role of emojis in digital communication. Emojis are universally understood and add personality and tone to your content. They’re also highly engaging — especially when it comes to how different generations interpret each emoji. (Just ask your nearest Millennial and Gen Z friends what they think the thumbs-up emoji means. I’ll bet my World Emoji Day post they say something different.) Content ideas: Challenge followers to describe their day using only emojis. Use emojis to tell a story about your brand. Post a poll: “What’s your most-used emoji?” July 18: Nelson Mandela Day July 30: International Day of Friendship August 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events National Immunization Awareness Month Black Business Month 📅 Key dates August 9: Book Lovers Day Celebrated globally, this day is a tribute to bibliophiles and the joy of reading. Book-related content performs well for audiences interested in self-growth, creativity, or storytelling. Content ideas: Share your team’s favorite books or recommendations for your audience. Speaking of — check out the Buffer team’s recent reads. Host a poll: “Which genre do you love most?” Post quotes from books that align with your brand values. August 12: International Youth Day August 13: Left-Handers Day August 21: Senior Citizens Day August 26: National Dog Day Founded in 2004, National Dog Day honors the bond between humans and their furry companions while promoting adoption. Also: you really can’t go wrong with pet content. This is a great opportunity to connect with your audience on a personal, emotional, tail-wagging level. Content ideas: Promote dog adoption by using your platform to share some of the pups waiting for forever home. Share photos of your team’s dogs or invite followers to submit their pet pictures. We opted to use a similar post idea on Halloween in 2024: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Buffer (@buffer) September 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events Suicide Prevention Month Friendship Month 📅 Key dates September 1: Labor Day September 1: Back to Hogwarts Day Oktoberfest (Sep 20—Oct 5) September 8: International Literacy Day Proclaimed by UNESCO in 1966, this day highlights literacy as a human right and a foundation for development. It’s an opportunity to advocate for education and self-improvement. Content ideas: Share stats about global literacy and how followers can support literacy programs. Ask: “What book had the biggest impact on your life?” Highlight organizations working to improve literacy worldwide. September 21: International Day of Peace September 30: International Podcast Day Launched in 2014, this day celebrates the growth and influence of podcasts as a medium for storytelling and education. Podcasts are a fast-growing content format, and this day is perfect for connecting with podcast enthusiasts in your audience. Content ideas: Share your favorite podcasts and ask for your audience’s recommendations. On the hunt for new shows? Check out this list of our favorite podcasts from 2024 . If you host a podcast, share a sneak peek of your setup or upcoming episode. October 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events Domestic Violence Awareness Month Breast Cancer Awareness Month October has been dedicated to raising awareness about breast cancer since 1985, focusing on education, research, and early detection. This month brings attention to a cause that affects millions. If it makes sense for you to do so, creating thoughtful, supportive content can align your brand with a meaningful issue. Content ideas: Share resources about early detection and prevention. Highlight stories of survivors or organizations making a difference. Invite followers to share how they support loved ones affected by breast cancer. 📅 Key dates October 1: Yom Kippur October 7: World Teacher's Day October 10: World Mental Health Day Long gone are the days when mental health issues were swept under the rug. Organized by the World Health Organization, this day raises awareness about mental health issues and promotes support for mental well-being. Content ideas: Post tips for managing stress and improving mental health, or partner with a mental health expert for a Q&A or AMA. In 2024, the official Olympic Games accounts shared mental health tips from the world’s top athletes: If life ever feels like this, sometimes a little breathwork can go a long way. ✨ More tips and tools for everyday mental fitness practices used by Olympians here: https://t.co/knDYEzjPt9 #WorldMentalHealthDay @POWERADE @Athlete365 pic.twitter.com/bHpw4Ko2QQ — The Olympic Games (@Olympics) October 31, 2024 Share personal or team stories about prioritizing mental well-being. Ask followers: “What’s one small thing you do for self-care?” October 20: Diwali Known as the Festival of Lights, Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It’s one of the most significant festivals in Hindu culture. Diwali’s themes of renewal, hope, and community make it universally inspiring. The festival is also a visual feast, perfect for creating captivating social media content — again, it makes sense for you or your brand to do so. Content ideas: A simple happy Diwali message to all your followers or customers who celebrate will go a long way. Spotlight South Asian creators or businesses. October 31: Halloween November 2025 🗓️ Monthly themes and events Men’s Health Awareness Month (Movember) Epilepsy Awareness Month 📅 Key dates November 2: Daylight Savings ends (U.S.) November 23: Espresso Day November 27: Thanksgiving (U.S.) November 28: Black Friday November 29: Small Business Saturday You’ve heard of Black Friday, but what about Small Business Saturday ?
