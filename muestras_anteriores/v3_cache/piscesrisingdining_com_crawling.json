What started as an old bungalow home built in 1919, transformed into the beautiful establishment it is today. Capturing the historic Mount Dora vibes, the original owners of the restaurant choose to keep the original 1919 home intact and made it the centerpiece of the restaurant. The original living room and dining room of the home is used as dining areas for small and large parties. Enjoy outside dining on the deck or tiki bar overlooking Lake Dora and the setting sun. For a more intimate experience, dine inside surrounded by beautiful windows that offer a spectacular view of the lake. The open kitchen is our “heart-of-the-house.” Our menu consists of Southern Florida dishes with a focus on utilizing fresh, local ingredients.
