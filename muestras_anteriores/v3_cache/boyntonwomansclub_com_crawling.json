Next Monday, September 8th, is International Literacy Day. Literacy has been a key focus of GFWC, and our member clubs, since the 19th century: helping every member of our communities, old and young, reach their potential through reading skills and comprehension. During the 1962-1964 administration of GFWC President Margaret Long Arnold, we even sponsored the publication of a manual (with the help of experts at the US Office of Education, forerunner of the Department of Education). Specifically aimed at volunteers, we believed it would help our members dive into \"the fight against illiteracy.\" In a letter urging clubs to purchase the book, Arnold wrote, \"You will see that there is a job for all club members at all levels… This is an important project upon which we have embarked to help our fellow citizens help themselves. It is a giant step in the right direction and we must not let our footsteps falter as we face the many problems that will have to be surmounted.\" 📒\"Your club can spark the fight against illiteracy!\" Flyer for the new book \"Teaching Adults the Literacy Skills,\" 1963.

To round out our look at the letters received by the GFWC Resolutions Committee in the lead-up to the 1914 convention, here is one of the odder letters in that archival file: an urgent plea from inventor Laura A. McLain of Newark, Ohio, to Jane Addams (yes, that Jane Addams) regarding the dangers of unguarded hatpins. Mrs. McLain received a patent for her new and improved “hat-pin guard” in January 1914. Seeing a potential market, or knowing the legislative successes of the Federation (probably both), McLain hoped to persuade attendees of our June 1914 Convention to adopt her invention both in spirit (in the form of a resolution) and in fact (in the form of purchased guards). Her letter claims, “there is no work needed more than to stop the use of the barbarous unprotected hat pin…if there is any reform work needed more than this, I should be glad to know what it is.” Hatpins could indeed be dangerous, both purposefully – see the comments for links regarding the “hatpin peril” of the early 20th century, mostly in relation to women using them for self-defense against harassment – and accidentally. But, to be blunt (no hatpin pun intended), there were more pressing items on the GFWC agenda. Sadly for the enterprising Mrs. McLain, it doesn’t seem that the Convention took this problem seriously enough to offer it as a formal resolution. As for Jane Addams, my suspicion is that she never saw this letter; it was probably delivered to the Chicago hotel where the convention was taking place and redirected to the Resolutions committee. But the fact that a non-member addressed a plea to Addams, as a Chicago representative of GFWC, does speak to her renown as both an activist and a clubwoman. 📷 First page of McLain's letter to GFWC via Jane Addams, June 9, 1914. (Full text of the letter in the comments.) Resolutions collection, correspondence, 1914 📷 Patent no. 1,083,333 granted to Laura A. McLain of Newark, Ohio on January 6, 1914 for a Hat Pin Guard, \"a useful and ornamental device which may be slipped over the pointed end of a pin that is projected through the hat to prevent contact of said point with any object.\" … See More See Less 2 weeks ago GFWC proudly commemorates the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote.

Long before most military branches opened their doors, women were officially appointed as keepers in the U.S. Lighthouse Service, a proud predecessor to today’s Coast Guard. These trailblazing women safeguarded our shores, guided sailors home through every storm, and rescued numerous boaters in distress, undoubtedly laying the foundation for centuries of female Coast Guard heroes to come.

Ownership of the building, designed by architect Addison Mizner and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, was officially transferred on March 9 to the city from the Boynton Beach Community Redevelopment Agency. The CRA purchased the building, located at 1010 S. Federal Highway, in 2017 for $110,000 after the ladies of the volunteer Woman's Club were unable to raise the money for necessary restoration. It was appraised last year for just under $630,000. As part of the deal, the CRA will provide the city with annual grants of $250,000 for three years to cover expenses for things like making improvements to match city code and increasing accessibility for visitors.

The building was shut down as a result of COVID-19 and has resumed holding events only since January. City officials are confident the Woman's Club can eventually turn a profit by being rented out for weddings, birthday parties, business conferences and other private uses. During a CRA meeting last May, city administrators estimated the 12,626-square-foot facility could hold 25 weddings a year and generate $50,000 annually. Combined with other special events and fees – including a projected $100,000 from vendors – the building will attract $361,000 annually in revenue compared to $189,000 in expenses for a net income of $172,000, according to the city. Local residents get a discount on rental charges. Among the expected expenses are $50,000 to hire an event supervisor. \"One of the ways to keep the Woman's Club in good repair is to use it, because if it’s not used, you sometimes miss out on something small that leads to a big problem,\" Mayor and CRA Chairman Steven Grant said. Construction on the building was completed in 1926 and dedicated to Major Nathan S. Boynton, the city’s founder, in 1932. It’s housed events from World War II-era Red Cross dances to annual scholarship programs and served as the city library until 1961 and as a hurricane shelter in its early days. The structure is an example of the Mediterranean Revival style of architecture made popular in Palm Beach County by Mizner, arguably the best known American architect of the 1920s. He provided the design to Boynton Beach for free, and the facility is the only Mizner-designed project in South Florida that is open to the public. \"It’s an extremely unique building that we’re very happy to have here in Boynton Beach,\" Grant said. Boynton has one other nationally registered historic place, the Schoolhouse Children’s Museum, which the city owns. Anyone interested in renting the building or its future programming is asked to contact Diane Valenti at 561-742-6756. jmilian@pbpost.com @caneswatch Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Sitemap Legals Public notice certification Our Ethical Principles USA TODAY Network Style Guide Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Advertiser Acceptance Policy Terms of Service Privacy Policy California Notice at Collection Your Privacy Choices Contact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Promote your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Palm Beach Post Store Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Newspapers In Education Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper Archives Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Shopping 10BEST LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions © 2025 www.palmbeachpost.com.
