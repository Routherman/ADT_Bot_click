Crystal River delights visitors year-round with its unique collection of things to see and experience, as well as delicious dining options! DAY 1 Soak up the local flavor by exploring Crystal River’s downtown, which features the charming Heritage Village collection of shops and restaurants. Head to Citrus Avenue just off of Highway 19 to begin the fun. Get your adventure to a leisurely start by browsing the shops and savoring the charm of this guest-friendly town. Whether you are looking for a plush manatee or timeless antique to remember your visit by, the Shoppes of Heritage Village have something for everyone. Don’t miss Southern Babe Boutique , The Cotton Club and All About Nature . Creative and affordable lunch offers can be found nearby. Several eateries can be found downtown including Amy on the Avenue , Cattle Dog Coffee Roasters , BubbaQue’s BBQ , and Tea House 650 — all within walking distance. A frosty cold adult beverage can be found at St. John’s Tavern , KC Wine and Koffee Bar , or Copp Winery & Brewery on the Bayside of the downtown area. In the afternoon, enjoy the full span of the area’s centuries of history by Coastal Heritage Museum and Crystal River Archaeological State Park . The Coastal Heritage Museum chronicles the beginnings of western Citrus County, and its historic building was built in 1939 by WPA labor. The Archaeological State Park dates back significantly further, when the series of shell middens at the park were an important ceremonial center for the thousands of ancient Native Americans. A museum showcasing a variety of artifacts can also be toured at the park. After a busy day of shopping and history, you will be in the mood for the local tastes available from Crystal River restaurants. Enjoy fresh-caught local fish and fresh produce (often locally grown) in a variety of familiar dishes and new favorites. The area has more than enough one-of-a-kind restaurants for your entire stay, from the fine eclectic flavors of Vintage on 5th , to a little surf and turf at Kane’s Cattle Co ., or fresh “Fish of the Day” and live music at Waterfront Social . DAY 2 Having enjoyed Crystal River on land, today is the perfect time to head out and discover why our community is a water lover’s dream. Boat tours by knowledgeable guides will show you the natural aquatic wonders of the Crystal River and its estuary. Learn about—and see up close—a vast array of flora and fauna from the unique ecosystems of the Nature Coast and take in the beautiful scenery. These tours operate daily and can be focused on leisure, eco-site seeing, or fishing. If you would prefer to do the exploring yourself, you can also rent a boat and traverse the area’s picturesque waterways at your own pace. Pack a picnic lunch and meander until you find a nice, shaded place to stop and eat. Renting a boat makes it easy to dive into the area’s many springs , which have consistent 73° (23° C) temperatures all year long for your swimming pleasure. Speaking of rentals, kayak and paddle board rentals are as plentiful as they are affordable in and around Crystal River. Visitors from all over come to Crystal River specifically for a paddling trip. One of the most glorious spots is Three Sisters Springs, a natural inlet which is home to many manatees. DAY 3 Finish your three-day stay on an exceptionally high note with one of Crystal River’s most renowned activities: swimming with manatees or scalloping . Manatee tours operate all year round, although the very best time to meet a manatee is in the cooler months. As the water temperature in the ocean drops, hundreds of manatees make their way into the comparatively warm springs and spring-fed rivers of Citrus County, creating North America’s largest manatee gathering every year. These guided trips often depart early in the morning, carrying you to the ideal grounds for sea-cow encounters in the crisp morning air. Tour operators typically supply a snorkel and wetsuit; just don’t forget a swimsuit—and your sense of wonder. Another seasonal sensation is scalloping. Yielding a great deal of fun with little cost or equipment needed, scalloping is a wildly popular family activity from July 1st – September 24th each year. Grab a snorkel and mesh bag to harvest scallops in four to six feet of water a short way offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. As with manatee swims, many guide services are available. As your third day of adventure draws to a close and you set to return home, you’ll discover that there still remains much to experience in Crystal River and throughout Citrus County. Fortunately, The Water Lover’s Florida is always ready to welcome you back for another affordable family vacation! FREE PLANNING ASSISTANCE For more information on any of these fantastic activities, contact the Citrus County Visitors & Convention Bureau at 1-800-587-6667 for free assistance. And be sure to stop by and say hello at the Visitors Center on US 19 in Crystal River.

Welcome to The Manatee Capital of the World with spring-fed rivers and bays that offer an abundance of epic water activities and attract loveable manatees year-round. Florida: First Magnitude Crystal River is a place defined by water. It starts with the river for which the city is named and the natural wonder on which the city sits: Kings Bay. Kings Bay is fed by over seventy springs and as many as forty more seeps that feed 600 million gallons of freshwater a day into this incredible body of freshwater sitting only six miles from the Gulf of Mexico. It is a first magnitude Florida springs system and a leading winter refuge for the Florida Manatee. In fact, it is so important to the survival of manatees that The Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge is the only Refuge in the United States dedicated to the preservation and protection of a single species Manatees The springs here are epic and provide an incredible experience for meeting a manatee . The biggest spring is King Spring on the southern tip of Banana Island. The most famous though, by far, is Three Sisters Springs, a place so remarkable it’s best described as a National Park in one acre. This amazing crystal-clear spring in a wooded grove defies imagination and has become known internationally for the incredible number of manatees that gather here in winter. A visit to the Three Sisters Springs Boardwalk, or swimming with manatees in the spring on a manatee tour, is a must. World-renowned Crystal River is the Gem of the Nature Coast Epic Springs The most accessible spring in Crystal River is at Hunter’s Springs Park on the shoreline near downtown. This newly restored City Park features a sandy beach for swimmers, a kayak launch and a boardwalk for viewing manatees. Nearby Kings Bay Park, also on the downtown waterfront, provides another public kayak launch, a pier for fishing and sweeping views of the Cedar Cove area of Kings Bay. This is seafood central in Crystal River with three waterfront restaurants serving seafood, often fresh off the boat from the two active commercial fishing operations on the waterfront. The Heart of Crystal River All of this is just steps away from Crystal River’s historic Downtown on North Citrus Avenue. More incredible restaurants and cafes abound as well as shopping in the Heritage Village district on the north side of US Highway 19. From the Stone Crab Jam festival celebrating Stone Crab season in November to the Florida Manatee Festival in January and the Kings Bay Pirate Festival in May, Downtown Crystal River is alive with fun and adventure throughout the year. Throughout town you’ll find hotels, motels, and even a bed & breakfast right on the waterfront, each with an amazing view. The Crystal River Preserve State Park is located to the west of town and features many walking, birding, and biking trails. Inside the preserve the Crystal River Archeological State Park features an important Native American ceremonial site in use before the arrival of Europeans in the Western Hemisphere. The highest point in Crystal River happens to be the temple mound at this site which provides an excellent view of the Crystal River and its incredible sunsets. Without a doubt, the best sunset views are to be had on the Gulf of Mexico itself. Sunsets are a ritual at Fort Island Gulf Beach, nine miles west of town on Fort Island Trail with a drum-circle adding rhythm and a beat on the second Sunday of each month. This 15 acre park features a beach, fishing pier, woodland boardwalk and a boat ramp right on the Gulf. With so much to experience, it’s no wonder Crystal River is considered the “gem of the nature coast.” Waterfront restaurants , eclectic shops, and friendly smiles are abundant here in Crystal River.
