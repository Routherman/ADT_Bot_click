Since our inception, we have earned the exclusive Good Sam 10-10-10 rating. Our RV lifestyle choices range from sites to custom-built homes, all designed with RVers in mind. Our motto has always been “Stay a Night or a Lifetime!” We began with an idea to create a naturally beautiful, truly unique RV resort – a quiet 2,800-acre community of towering pines, swaying palms, picturesque lakes and a gorgeous golf course, perfect for any vacation. We planned carefully to offer serenity and privacy, yet also feature a fine restaurant, café dining and superb sporting facilities on site. And we did it! Our first priority is, and always will be, to preserve the natural surroundings of this remarkable resort. That’s why each site is carefully planned to leave as much nature as possible. It was also our intent for the majority of our sites to back up to our golf course, a lake or nature so that you would have neighbors side to side, but no one behind you. We enhanced nature with man-made pleasures so you could experience the scenic beauty of our par-72, 18-hole championship golf course winding through woodlands…. or try your luck with rod and reel against the largemouth bass carefully stocked in our lakes and ponds. We are catch and release only – no live bait allowed!  Fishing hours are from sunrise to sunset. Our four-legged friends are welcome at The Great Outdoors. We even have “Doggie World”, a fenced area where they can run and play while their owners get acquainted. As an overnight vacationer, you’ll appreciate our paved streets, wide turnarounds and angled sites. For your pleasure and convenience, all full-hookup sites include level, concrete pads, 30/50 amp electric, water and sewer. At The Great Outdoors, you can have the best of both worlds – the easy-going RV lifestyle or a beautiful site-built home of your own, with RV parking right on your own lot. If you decide you want to join our resort on a more permanent basis, or if you are looking to investing for your future, you will be glad to know that your site is deeded to you with a fee simple title – you own your land!

All three ratings categories are measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Less than 1 percent of parks or campgrounds receive the coveted 10 | 10 | 10 rating, which indicates superior facilities that are well maintained, clean, well-appointed restrooms and a highly appealing appearance. Campgrounds are inspected annually by dedicated RVers like you. Completeness of facilities 10 10 10 The first campground rating evaluates completeness and quality of facilities. In this category we rate interior roads, sites, registration area, hookups, recreation, swimming, security, laundry, store and building maintenance. Cleanliness of restrooms and showers 10 10 10 The second rating category concerns the cleanliness and physical characteristics of toilets, walls, showers, sinks/counters/mirrors and floor. If a park achieves a full point in each of the above, it receives a star ( ), indicating exceptionally clean restrooms. Also rated are physical characteristics of restrooms, including interior construction, adequate supplies/odor free, adequate number of facilities, exterior appearance and location in relation to park spaces, and interior appearance. Visual appeal and environmental quality 10 10 10 This category addresses the park's setting and site layout, function and identification of signage, overall exterior building maintenance, noise, trash disposal, litter and debris around the grounds and sites, and appearance of grounds, sites and entrance area.

      "text": "About Us - The Great Outdoors Fund About Us Our Programs Unsmoke Canada Cleanups Our Projects Our Partners News & Insights About Us Our Programs Unsmoke Canada Cleanups Our Projects Our Partners News & Insights Our Story The Great Outdoors Fund began with a realization that the world’s public lands and water, along with recreational infrastructure, should be accessible to all. In the United States, what we saw was a visible gap. There was no focused effort on aiding agencies or other non-profits in their quest to protect our outdoor spaces and ensure the quality of recreation. The creation of The Great Outdoors Fund fills this gap. Equitable recreational access requires both financial and volunteer support to  thrive, and TGOF has created a mechanism solely focused on outdoor recreation by finding, developing, and leading public-private partnerships that enhance, protect, and provide access to the diverse, geographic beauty of North America. Therefore, in 2017, The Great Outdoors Fund was established as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization dedicated to this mission. VISION We aspire to be the premier organization in North America and foremost leader in curating long-term, sustainable funding and partnerships that enhance equitable access and outdoor recreational opportunities for all. MISSION We find the resources and make visible investments in recreation infrastructure through public-private partnerships for the benefit and enjoyment of all people. VALUES Partnerships & Collaboration The essence of our work is to foster and develop positive relationships to provide the best outdoor recreational experiences. Equitable access Regardless of social determinants, we build memorable, accessible, and equitable outdoor experiences. Visible investments We ensure all aspects of our projects leave a tangible and sustainable impact in every community. Trust & Transparency We build partnerships and programs to instill confidence and credibility in what we do. Board Members LORI McCULLOUGH Founder Lori McCullough has more than 25 years’ experience as a CEO and Executive Director in the conservation and outdoor recreation communities. As a graduate of Duke University’s Executive Leadership and Nonprofit Management program, Lori has spent her career working with leaders of Fortune 500 companies, natural resource agencies, non-government organizations and special interest groups to build hundreds of lasting partnerships to protect recreation access and opportunities around the world. Her passion for promoting responsible recreation and an outdoor lifestyle, combined with her commitment to helping keep the great outdoors open for the benefit and enjoyment of all people played an integral part in the establishment of The Great Outdoors Fund. MELISSA SIMPSON Secretary/Treasurer Melissa was just named the President of the Western Energy Alliance. She has over two decades of experience working on energy, wildlife, and conservation policy in Washington D.C. as a political appointee in the federal government in the private sector.

Ride safe and have a blast at Idaho Dunes RV! Meet the Team Mike McGroarty Owner Mike McGroarty has been an off-road, aviation, and outdoor enthusiast his entire life.  At the age of 15, Mike earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America and by that time had over 300 nights of wilderness camping experience.  His love for the outdoors turned into a passion for off-roading as soon as his first job earned him enough income to purchase his first sport ATV.  This first ATV started an addiction for rock crawling, trail riding and sand duning that still occupies 100% of Mike’s interest to this day. Garrett McGroarty Manager Garrett McGroarty was born into the “Idaho Dunes Way of Life”.  At 3 years old, Garrett started his off-road passion on a Kawasaki KFX 50.  Garrett has logged more trail miles between Idaho Dunes RV and West Yellowstone than anyone in the area.  At a young age, Garrett developed a passion for helicopters and aviation.  Before graduating from high school, Garrett earned both his private helicopter license (PPL-H) and commercial helicopter license (CPL-H).  With advanced pilot training from the best instructors in the industry at Helisafe in Southern California, Garrett has mastered the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopters flight systems and emergency procedures.  If you have questions about the campground, dunes, local area, trail rides, or helicopter tours Garrett is your best bet to get the answers you are looking for.
