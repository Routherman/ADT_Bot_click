Susan Waite's Bio Rules Official PGA Professional – The First Tee of North Florida As a Navy Brat, I had the privilege of living in Italy while I was in sixth and seventh grade, living on the United States Naval Academy during eighth, ninth and tenth grade, before settling in Jacksonville to round out my High School years as a Robert E. Lee Fighting General! I’ve always enjoyed sports, and as a young girl learned to play soccer in the streets of Naples, Italy. However, upon returning to the States, soccer wasn’t too popular and I turned to basketball and softball. In college, during a one-year sabbatical between my sophomore and junior years, I was fortunate enough to take up The Game of Golf, played everyday, and eventually “walked on” to the Lady Gator Golf Team. During college I found myself constantly seeking part-time summer and holiday breaks working in the golf business at various country clubs. Upon graduating from The University of Florida, College of Journalism and Communications, my love of golf (and connections made therein) lead to a sales position with IZOD LaCoste in Pittsburgh, PA. Using my amateur golf skills as a means to succeed in the “real working world” (again, all the connections made on the golf course) I was encouraged to turn my love of The Game into a profession. I accepted a full-time position in the Ponce de Leon Golf Shop, and after two failed attempts, practiced hard and long enough to pass the PGA Player Ability Test. After enjoying 20 years as an assistant golf professional at The Ponce, Deercreek Country Club, and San Jose Country Club, as a First Tee Coach, and a Rules Official with The North Florida Junior Golf Tour, I can now enjoy and experience what I never played…Junior Golf! Mark Heeter's bio Rules Official Retired Mark Heeter has been a rules official with NFJG TOUR since the spring of 2015. Mark was born and raised in northern Ohio. He spent the majority of his working career in the automotive and trucking industry. His skills and training led him to the management side of the business and for 18 years, as Service Director, he led an award-winning service department of a Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep dealership. Mark started golfing at the age of 14, but was focused on pole vaulting throughout high school and into college. As an adult his focus changed to the game of golf, where he played on several golf leagues and begin spending time on his game in hopes of moving to Florida some-day to pursue a career as a professional golfer. In 1999 Mark moved to Jacksonville Florida to pursue his dream. In an effort to help fund his training, Mark joined Windsor Parke Golf Club as a member but was soon offered a position as an assistant in the golf shop. Having a solid business background, he entered the PGA training program and in 2004 was offered and accepted the position of Head Golf Professional/Director of Golf at Windsor Parke. He remained in that capacity till 2015 when the course was sold and Mark retired. Mark traded his dream of becoming a professional golfer for being an excellent golf professional, honing his teaching skills, conducting successful junior golf camps and helping junior golfers pursue their dreams. His knowledge of the game, his easy-going attitude, sense of humor, and admiration for the kids that play the game, make him a good fit for the NFJG team. Don Moore Bio Rules Official Don has been a Rules Official for NFJG since the fall of 2024. Don is an aspiring PGA professional who began his golf journey in 2018. He is the president and co-founder of Purple Heart Golf, an ambassador to the PGA Hope program, Director with the Jacksonville Area Golf Association, and active member with the Veteran’s Golf Association where he was recognized as a flighted 2021 National Champion.

Hear from Jacksonville Golf Residents Q: What do you LOVE about Jacksonville Golf & CC? JGCC has a great central location in Jacksonville, situated between downtown and the beaches. This makes a drive to the airport or the beaches a quick drive. The St Johns Town Center is ten minutes away and positioned near the J Turner Butler artery offering quick access to the main highways. The community has a mature landscaping canopy and the Association does a great job of keeping homeowners on top of their maintenance so there are very few homes that appear neglected. –Brad K Q: What do people get wrong about Jacksonville Golf & CC? People don’t realize that the community offers tremendous amenities such as golf, tennis, and swimming that are just as nice as the major clubs at the beaches for a much more modest price. The members-owned club continues to invest in and improve these amenities and keep them in top condition. -Brad K Q: Do you use the Jacksonville Golf & CC membership? I play golf at the club at least 2-3 times per week and my wife plays tennis 3-4 times per week while my teenage daughter has taken up tennis in the past year as well. -Brad K Q: What DON’T people know about Jacksonville Golf & CC? It’s a tremendous family community. Though there is certainly a mix of young and old there is a large segment of families with school-age children which gives the community a vibrant feel. -Brad K Q: What would you improve about Jacksonville Golf & CC? Increase the membership fees! Higher fees = Higher value. Compared to other clubs in town, JGCC is much less expensive. -Brad K Browse Other Florida Beach Communities We Serve Atlantic Beach Jacksonville Beach Neptune Beach Nocatee Ponte Vedra Beach South Ponte Vedra Contact The Volen Group today for help with your next home.

In golf terms, Willow Creek Golf Club is a relative newcomer. Whereas some courses are into their second century, this is a baby, having opened in 1995. But through the keen eye of golf architect Tom Jackson, Willow Creek pays tribute to the natural splendor of the terrain, giving the course a look and feel that gives the golfer the feeling of playing a much older, “trad” golf course. Best of all for our players, Mr. Jackson’s functional layouts hold up well against time. Jackson’s golf courses around the United States are all considered masterpieces of golf design. We have a great golf course, so let’s have some fun with it! Friendly is the name of the game at Willow Creek. Since fun goes hand in hand with friendly, we’ve literally made fun our goal: Mission Statement: We strive to create a fun and social golfing atmosphere that will earn the trust and friendship of our golfers. The foundation of our Golf Club is built on the principles of friendly, professional, and dedicated service. These principles are accompanied by our goal to provide quality and enjoyable course conditions and ensure the growth and existence of the game of golf. We want our Members and Guests to feel like our Golf Club is their home away from home.
