By Brandi Addison Special Contributor Nov. 18, 2020 | Updated 4:12 p.m. CST | 3 min. read Keith Ashley, owner of Nine-Band Brewing Company in Allen, photographed on April 17, 2014. Rose Baca / neighborsgo staff photographer Updated at 4:08 p.m. with additional information about Keith Ashley’s job at City Hospital at White Rock in Dallas. The owner and founder of Nine Band Brewing Co. in Allen has been arrested on a murder charge in Carrollton, police said Wednesday, less than a week after he was arrested on federal fraud charges alleging he ran a million-dollar Ponzi scheme. Keith Ashley, 48, is accused of murdering Jim Seegan on Feb. 19 in an attempt to gain control of his finances, according to a news release from the Carrollton Police Department . He was arrested on the wire fraud charges Friday, according to the release, and is being held at the Fannin County Sheriff’s Office without bail. Keith Ashley, owner of Nine Band Brewing Company in Allen, has been arrested for federal fraud and murder charges. Rose Baca / neighborsgo staff photographer Ashley was Seegan’s friend and financial adviser and would visit his home periodically, police said. Seegan’s death was initially ruled a suicide after a typed note was found next to his body, but police say detectives found evidence that Ashley staged the situation. In the left hand of the 62-year-old was a semi-automatic handgun, according to the arrest warrant. The last sentence of the “suicide note\" — without any handwriting or signature — read, “My last friend Keith Ashley will help you” with Ashley’s phone number included.

Seegan’s wife Sakida “Dida” Seegan told investigators her husband was right-handed and didn’t own a gun, leading to a series of investigations. While viewing the home’s video surveillance, detectives determined Ashley was the last person inside the home before Dida Seegan discovered her husband dead in an upstairs office that day. Advertisement According to the arrest warrant, an autopsy showed Seegan had Etomidate in his system, a drug that is used as a general anesthetic. Detectives said Seegan was not a drug user and didn’t appear to have any emergency medical care that would have necessitated the use of Etomidate, which is not easily accessible outside of a hospital. Ashley, a registered nurse, worked for City Hospital at White Rock in Dallas at the time of Seegan’s death. Hospital communications staff said he worked there from May 19, 2019, to July 14, 2020, when he was terminated for not working enough shifts. Carrollton police provided this photo of Jim Seegan of Carrollton, who police now say was murdered after his death in February 2020 was initially ruled a suicide. Courtesy / Carrollton Police Department When Dida Seegan reached out to Ashley to notify him of his passing, he told her he needed Jim Seegan’s phone to contact his financial institutions. She told detectives that Ashley told her he “accidentally” deleted the messages between the two men. Detectives said Ashley wired $20,000 from Jim Seegan’s bank account while in possession of the phone — without consent from Dida Seegan, according to the arrest warrant. During the course of the nine-month investigation with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, police said they discovered other victims of a “Ponzi-type scheme\" perpetrated by Ashley. Anyone with information related is asked to call 972-466-9133 or email crimetips@cityofcarrollton.com . Advertisement Court documents accuse Ashley of cheating investors of more than $1.1 million by using funds from his financial services company, North Texas Money Management, for personal purposes, including brewery expenses, mortgage payments, casino spending and student loans. Ashley, a former financial partner of McKinney’s Franconia Brewing Company, was the subject of a 2014 Dallas Morning News story about the opening of Nine Band Brewing. The Allen Economic Development Corporation provided Nine Band with $75,000 in economic incentives to open the city’s first brewery, named after the nine-banded armadillo. The city did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. At the time, Ashley said he chose Allen over other cities because of its proximity to Dallas, the support of city officials and the city’s family-friendly atmosphere. Advertisement “I’m a very family-oriented individual, and I have to feel that same feeling,” Ashley said in the article. “I have to know that the city that I’m with is going to be supportive. And I get that feeling here in Allen.” The brewery and taproom, located at 9 Prestige Circle, lists about a dozen different styles of beer on its website . Representatives from the brewery could not immediately be reached Wednesday.
