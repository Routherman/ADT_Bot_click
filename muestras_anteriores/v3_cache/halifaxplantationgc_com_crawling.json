A neighborhood Watch is designed to provide extra eyes and ears for law enforcement. The program requires volunteer block captains and co-captains to work with a local Prevention Deputy to educate members in the principles of deterrence, delay and detection and to communicate events to the entire group. Members are instructed how to report suspicious activity to the Sheriff’s Office as soon as it’s observed. The key to a safe community is to share information and report suspicious activities. Neighborhood watch groups are a great way for citizens to work together to prevent crime, maintain a safe community and build relationships with neighbors. A number of residents have already volunteered to become block captains, but we could use more in both our older established sections and newer sections recently developed. If you would be interested in becoming a block captain or co-captain as part of our Neighborhood Watch, please email your name, address, email and phone number to HPNW23@yahoo.com . You will be contacted about an organizational meeting and have any questions answered. “Halifax Plantation Phase 2 & 3 … Great Places to Live!” © 2025 Halifax Plantation Phase 2 & 3 HOA"
