Whether supporting back-office operations or street-level services, team members are aligned around the DSA mission: to create a healthy, vibrant downtown for all. Our teams include: operations, advocacy and economic development, communications and marketing, streetscape cleaning, parks and public realm management, hospitality and public safety services, research and market analysis. Executive Team Jon Scholes President & CEO Jennifer Casillas VP, Public Realm & Ambassador Operations Alex Hudson Executive Director, Commute Seattle Matt Gurney Chief Operating Officer Close Jon Scholes President & CEO Downtown Seattle Association Jon Scholes is president & CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association where he is responsible for the operations and programs of the DSA, an 1,100-member association formed in 1958 to create a healthy, vibrant downtown for all. In this capacity, Jon is also responsible for the management of the Metropolitan Improvement District (MID), which was established by property owners and the City of Seattle in 1999 to provide cleaning, safety, transportation, marketing and public-realm management services across 300 square blocks in downtown. He was appointed president and CEO of DSA in November of 2014 following six years as DSA’s vice president of advocacy and economic development. He has led the growth and expansion of the organization’s services, advocacy agenda and response to the impacts of the pandemic on downtown Seattle. Today, DSA is one of the three largest downtown organizations in North America as measured by total annual revenue and staff. Jon has spent more than 20 years working in nonprofit advocacy, public affairs, local government, and in senior positions on political campaigns at the regional and state levels. Jon serves on the boards of Visit Seattle, the International Downtown Association, and Downtown Emergency Services Center and has served on a number of city and county task forces focused on transportation, homelessness and housing. He was recognized in 2016 as a “40 Under 40” honoree by the Puget Sound Business Journal and named one of Seattle’s most influential people by Seattle Magazine in 2021. He is the host of Seattle City Makers, a podcast launched in 2022 featuring conversations with a cross section of leaders shaping the city. Jon is a graduate of Leadership Tomorrow and attended the University of Texas in Austin before graduating from the University of Washington. He lives in downtown Seattle with his wife and their 14-year-old twins. Close Jennifer Casillas VP, Public Realm & Ambassador Operations Downtown Seattle Association Jenn Casillas is the Vice President of Public Realm & Ambassador Operations at the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA). With more than 10 years at DSA, Jenn leads a talented team focused on staffing, activating, and programming downtown parks and public spaces. She has played a pivotal role in growing the Metropolitan Improvement District (MID) program, expanding its reach and deepening its positive impact across the public realm. Passionate about vibrant urban environments, Jenn thrives on the creativity and collaboration involved in bringing life and energy to downtown. Carrying out DSA’s mission to create a healthy, welcoming, and dynamic city core is at the heart of her work. Before joining DSA, Jenn served as Assistant Director of University Services at Seattle Pacific University. Earlier in her career, she held a variety of roles in business development, marketing, event planning and operations that helped shape her well-rounded and collaborative approach to leadership. Jenn earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Washington and holds a Master of Science in Communications from Ithaca College in New York. A native Seattleite, Jenn enjoys getting outside in nature and the urban environment including running along the shores of Alki Beach, urban hikes in various neighborhoods, skiing at nearby mountains and spending time and with family and friends. She stays active with her two teenagers and volunteers her time with organizations like Westside Baby and Northwest Hope & Healing. Close Alex Hudson Executive Director, Commute Seattle Alex Hudson is Executive Director of Commute Seattle. Alex brings more than nine years of experience as a nonprofit leader, having previously served as the executive director at Transportation Choices Coalition and the First Hill Improvement Association. A widely respected civic leader, Alex also serves on the boards of Bellwether Housing and the Freeway Park Association. Alex is a lifelong resident of King County who has proudly called First Hill home for more than 15 years. Her car-free family includes her partner, a teenager at Garfield High School (Go Bulldogs!), an elderly cat, and a jungle of houseplants. In her free time she enjoys spending time with her family, reading books from the library and exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest on transit and by bike. Close Matt Gurney Chief Operating Officer Downtown Seattle Association Matt Gurney joined the Downtown Seattle Association as the new chief operating officer, beginning May 12. In this role, Matt oversees DSA’s financial, human resources, regulatory and administrative functions. Matt brings a deep commitment to social impact, extensive leadership experience and a strong connection to the city. He has called Seattle home since 1995, and has a deep love for place. DSA’s mission and the work done through the Metropolitan Improvement District resonates with him — especially the commitment to creating opportunities for all and supporting a thriving downtown. Matt has spent much of his career in the social enterprise and nonprofit space. He served more than 20 years at FareStart in downtown Seattle, where he held senior leadership roles including VP of social enterprise and chief innovation officer. Most recently, he served as CEO of Fort Worden Hospitality. His roots in community impact go back to his first venture, Habitat Espresso, a Capitol Hill coffee house and social enterprise that developed the idea for a barista training program for homeless youth, which eventually became part of FareStart.

His music creations were melodic and beautiful, and his style was characterized by warm tone and improvisations. Fats Navarro’s Early Years and First Success Theodore Fats Navarro was born on September 24, 1923, in Key West, Florida. He was bilingual, speaking English and Spanish. As his father, who worked as a barber, had some musical knowledge, he hired a music teacher for little Theodore. Navarro got his first piano lessons at the age of six. Back then, he lacked a serious attitude towards music, however everything changed when he was thirteen and discovered the trumpet. Seeing Theodore’s devotion and serious attitude to music, his mother bought him a better-quality instrument. Apart from the trumpet, he also learned how to play a tenor sax. During his high school years, he played in the Walter Johnson’s band in Miami. Dizzy Gillespie was the musician who inspired Navarro to improvise. Theodore didn’t want to stay in his home place Key West, as he didn’t like it. As soon as he graduated from Frederick Douglass High School, he joined Albright’s his band in Orlando and traveled with them to Cincinnati. Navarro continued to refine his skills as a trumpeter, taking lessons from a teacher in Ohio. Very soon, he joined Russell's group. Fats Navarro’s Collaboration With Big Bands During 1941–1946 Navarro toured with big bands. During his life in the Midwest, he joined Russell's group, known as a “territorial” band in the 1940s, which provided a perfect opportunity for his growth as a musician. It became a place where Theodore could further improve his skills, experiment, and make mistakes. Here he also gained experience of what it was to be a touring musician. During his collaboration with Russell's band, he also met a young J.J. Johnson. Soon, Navarro was invited to join Billy Eckstine’s band, where a few prominent musicians played. While it didn’t provide much space for Navarro’s improvisations, he saw it as a chance to gain more experience. Navarro also worked with Andy Kirk and his \"Clouds of Joy.\" Generally, Navarro’s presence in big bands was described as lovable, and his horn performance was considered one of the most beautiful aspects. Fats Navarro and Bebop During 1946–1948 Navarro switched to bebop after growing tired of touring with big bands. He lived in New York City in 1946, and from this period, his career as a musician started gathering pace. Fats Navarro performed with small groups and musicians such as Kenny Clarke, Coleman Hawkins, Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis, Howard McGhee, and Illinois Jacquet. Navarro even played with well-known Charlie Parker, however none of Parker’s regular groups didn’t fit him as he was interested in a high salary. Instead of collaborating with Parker, Navarro joined the group of pianist Tadd Dameron from New York. With this band, Theodore recorded for Blue Note. Navarro’s collaboration with Dameron is considered the most productive. They had the right chemistry and sympathized one another. Navarro was significantly influenced by Dameron’s lyrical feeling. As Navarro’s priority was a high salary, he soon founded his own group for studio sessions. However, it was his collaboration with Dameron, mainly recordings and gigs in clubs, which helped Navarro became popular and highly admired by jazz community, fellow musicians and critics. Fats Navarro’s Dedication to Music After winning the Metronome Jazz Poll in 1948, Navarro received a chance to join the Metronome Jazz All-Stars for studio recordings. Apart from his active recording activities, he also started to demonstrate his compositional skills. Many of his works were dedicated to Dameron's band, with whom he occasionally continued to play. He was on tour with Lionel Hampton's band on route to Chicago, when he fell ill. His illness was diagnosed as tuberculosis. Despite his health condition, Navarro didn’t stop to play. However, combined with the effect of his drug addiction, this serious illness caused a rapid deterioration in his health. The last time when he toured was with the Jazz at the Philharmonic tour in February and March 1949. Navarro’s life cut short by tuberculosis on July 7, 1950, when he was only 26. Conclusion Despite his short life, Navarro’s recordings and performances have left a noticeable imprint on the jazz world. Many trumpeters mention him as a major influence. His stylistic influence is evident in the works of Clifford Brown and Lee Morgan.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - Gainesville Police are investigating another shooting that happened in Gainesville, this time right outside of multiple bars downtown and one business owner was very concerned. JD Chester owns Knockin’ Boots Saloon and Downtown Fats, which are both just feet away from where a shooting injured three people early Sunday around 2 a.m. “It’s definitely getting more and more dangerous downtown,” Chester said. “I mean I have safety concerns.” Witnesses told TV20 there were more than 100 people at a block party in the parking lot for the State Attorney’s Office when the shots were fired and one of those victims is a juvenile. Related story: GPD asking community for help to identify suspects in drive-by shooting “We had to barricade people inside the Knocking Boots Saloon to rush people inside to make sure nobody was going to get shot,” Chester said. Following the Sunday morning shooting, he said his staff at both establishments will be taking active shooter training because with this uptick in violence, you never know when the next shots will be fired. “And that is something honestly something I never thought I would have to do,” Chester said. GPD Spokesperson Graham Glover said police arrested two people, one who fled the scene. Both face possession charges but are not being charged for this shooting yet. “At this point we’re not prepared to say whether or not they were involved in the shooting,” Glover said. “The investigation will lead us to conclude one way or another on that.” While he is taking safety precautions, Chester said he hopes there is a decrease in gun violence, so his staff and customers can enjoy their night without worrying about another shooting. “Hopefully we’ll be able to stop the main problem and get back to what we used to have a year ago or two years ago,” Chester said.
