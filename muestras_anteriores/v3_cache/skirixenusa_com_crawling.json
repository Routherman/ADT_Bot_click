From wakeboarding and waterskiing to kneeboarding, each sport requires specific equipment to ensure safety and maximize fun. In this guide, we'll walk you through the must-have gear for each activity, so you can hit the water with confidence. And remember, if you have any questions or need expert advice, Ski Rixen USA is your go-to source for all things wake sports. With decades of experience, they offer the latest gear from top brands to keep you riding smoothly. Wakeboarding Gear 1. Wakeboard: Size and Shape: Choose a wakeboard that matches your skill level and body weight. Beginners may prefer a larger, more stable board, while advanced riders often opt for smaller, more maneuverable boards. Grind Base: If you're going to go for the thrills of hitting Ski Rixen's obstacles, you need a board with a grind base. This base allows riders to hit rails and ramps all day long with minimal impact to their board. Bindings: Ensure your bindings are comfortable and provide good ankle support. Adjustable bindings are great for families who share equipment. Fins: Fins help with stability and control. Beginners might want larger fins for more stability, while advanced riders may prefer smaller fins for better maneuverability. In some cases the fins are built into the board to match the board's prescribed skill level. 2. Life Jacket: Safety first! A well-fitting, Coast Guard-approved life jacket is non-negotiable. Make sure it’s comfortable and doesn't restrict movement. 3. Helmet: Protect your head from falls and collisions with a durable, water-sports-specific helmet. 4. Tow Rope: When you're riding behind the boat, a wakeboard-specific tow rope with a non-stretch handle is crucial for performance and safety. Look for one with a comfortable grip. If you're riding at Ski Rixen, we have you covered with the perfect tow rope. 5. Wetsuit or Rash Guard: Depending on the water temperature, you might need a wetsuit to stay warm. A rash guard can protect your skin from irritation caused by the board or life jacket, and give you some sun protection. Waterskiing Gear 1. Skis: Combo Skis: Ideal for beginners, these skis provide more stability and control. Slalom Skis: More advanced skiers might prefer a single slalom ski for more challenging maneuvers. 2. Bindings: Make sure your bindings are secure and comfortable. Adjustable bindings are useful for accommodating different foot sizes. Choose between open and closed toe bindings. There's not right answer here, it's just what you prefer. 3. Life Jacket: As with wakeboarding, a properly fitting, Coast Guard-approved life jacket is essential. 4. Tow Rope: Look for a waterski-specific rope with a comfortable handle and minimal stretch. At Ski Rixen, we already have you covered again! 5. Gloves: Waterskiing gloves can protect your hands and provide a better grip on the tow rope. 6. Wetsuit or Drysuit: Choose a wetsuit or drysuit based on the water temperature to stay warm and comfortable. Kneeboarding Gear 1. Kneeboard: Size and Shape: Choose a board that suits your experience level. Beginners might prefer a wider, more stable board, while advanced riders may want a narrower, more responsive one. Padding: Ensure the board has sufficient padding for comfort during extended rides. 2. Strap: A secure, adjustable strap is crucial for keeping you connected to the board during tricks and maneuvers. 3. Life Jacket: Safety is paramount, so always wear a well-fitting, Coast Guard-approved life jacket. 4. Tow Rope: A kneeboard-specific tow rope with a comfortable handle is essential. Some ropes have a bit of stretch to help with tricks. Ski Rixen already has these if you're riding with us! 5. Wetsuit or Rash Guard: Protect your skin and stay warm with a wetsuit or rash guard, especially in cooler water. 6. Helmet: Keep that noggin safe with a watersports specific helmet.

Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or advanced rider, understanding the key factors in choosing a wakeboard will help you progress and stay safe while also shortening your learning curve. Let’s dive into the essentials for each skill level. For Beginners: Stability and Ease of Use If you’re just starting out, your primary goal is to find a wakeboard that provides stability and is forgiving of mistakes (read, NOT NECESSARILY your favorite pro’s advanced board!). Here’s what to look for: Size Matters Choose a larger wakeboard with more surface area. Larger boards are more stable, easier to balance on, and offer a smoother ride. Use a sizing chart based on your weight to find the right board length. Continuous Rocker Opt for a board with a continuous rocker (a smooth, curved shape) for predictable and smooth rides. This design makes it easier to control the board and maintain stability. Continuous rocker typically makes it easier to control the board in turns as well, which helps when learning how to navigate the corners at Ski Rixen without catching an edge. Durable and Lightweight Materials Look for beginner boards made with durable materials like a grind base that can withstand hitting obstacles like rails and kickers. A new wakeboard is an investment, and you don’t want to check out your base to find out it’s ruined after a few passes over a beginner rail. Molded Fins Boards with molded-in fins provide better tracking and control, helping you maintain a straight path in the water. They also endure the inevitable wear and tear of hitting obstacles like rails and kickers much better. Pro Tip: Consider a wakeboard package that includes bindings. Beginner packages often pair the board with easy-to-use, adjustable bindings for a hassle-free experience (and often a better price!). For Intermediate Riders: Versatility and Performance As an intermediate rider, you’ve likely mastered the basics and are ready to explore new tricks and techniques. Your wakeboard should strike a balance between stability and performance. Here’s what to look for: Hybrid Rocker A lot of this is personal preference, but consider a board with a hybrid rocker (a mix of continuous and three-stage rockers). This design provides a good balance of speed, pop, and control, making it ideal for riders who are experimenting with kickers, air tricks and spins (less likely to catch an edge with imperfect board control). Medium Flex Opt for a board with medium flex. This allows you to enjoy both smooth landings and responsive handling, perfect for advancing your skills. Durability for Park or Boat If you’re looking to advance at cable parks like Ski Rixen, look for a wakeboard with a grind base for extra durability. The more obstacles you hit, the more fun wakeboarding is, but you need a board that will hold up to the abuse of intermediate kickers and rails. Pro Tip: Pay attention to the board’s width. Wider boards offer a softer landing, which can be beneficial as you learn new tricks. For Advanced Riders: Precision and Customization Advanced riders need a wakeboard that matches their aggressive style and complements their technical skills. Here’s what to prioritize: Three-Stage Rocker A three-stage rocker provides explosive pop, which many riders love for advanced tricks—but again—this is all personal preference. Stiff Flex Advanced boards often have a stiffer flex for precise control and responsiveness during technical maneuvers. Find a nice balance of stiffness so you can still control presses on rails but don’t sacrifice the feel of the water. High-Quality Construction Invest in a board made with premium materials with a high-end grind base. A cable-park-specific board is often essential for serious riders trying to advance to the next level with frequent riding. Pro Tip: Don’t hesitate to demo different boards before committing. Testing various models can help you find the perfect fit for your riding style. Final Thoughts Selecting the right wakeboard is crucial to your progress and enjoyment, no matter your skill level. Beginners should focus on stability and ease of use, intermediates on versatility and performance, and advanced riders on precision and durability. By understanding these key factors and considering your personal goals, you’ll be well-equipped to choose a wakeboard that keeps you excited and progressing every time you hit the water. At Ski Rixen USA , we’re here to help you find the perfect wakeboard and take your riding to the next level. Whether you’re just starting out or perfecting advanced tricks, our expert team can guide you through our selection of top-quality boards and gear.

Rixen’s Enterprises began in 1985 with each of these ideals forming the foundation. The business was started to fulfill a need in the local marine marketplace for the service and installation of heating systems. Jim Rixen, the company founder, had a desire to provide a better system and began searching. The result was the Quantum Heating Systems manufactured and designed by Rixen’s Enterprises Inc. The success in the marine industry was followed by an introduction into the RV industry. Expertise in electrical and mechanical systems and an effort for further system improvements, led Rixen’s Enterprises into the development of its’ own products. The services that we provide enable us to service our product lines, retrofit our products, and aid in the continual development of a better system. Distribution From 1995-2003, Rixen’s Enterprises was the exclusive distributor for Hurricane heaters in the USA. Starting in 2003, Rixen’s Enterprises became the exclusive distributor for Quantum Heating Systems. The Quantum Heating Systems incorporates ESPAR heaters as diesel fired furnaces. Manufacturing In 1996, we introduced our own products to further enhance our ability to supply the best comfort systems available. Free Support Any questions? Our team is just one click away!

Skis Gear Apparel Skis Gear Apparel Boys Girls skis Gear Apparel Community Outreach Hours of Operation People iSkiGreen.com Find Us - Jay Maine About Us Skiing has been a huge part of brothers Ron and Kenny Jacques life since their mother put them on skis in 1970. They started out at a small mountain with three rope tows, called Spruce Mtn., in Jay, Maine. They spent countless hours over the years ripping around the mountain with their friends. Little did they know, it would fuel their passion for skiing. It was there that the brothers started competing in Alpine and Nordic racing. Ron excelled in jumping and was a large part of several state championship teams over the years. Kenny also skied on both the junior and high school teams. After high school, Kenny worked in a local ski shop and started coaching alpine racing and has continued ever since. Ron and Kenny continued to ski race after school at different levels of competition until their kids started competing and the passion and focus turned to them. In 1996, after a great day of skiing at Sugarloaf/USA, the two hatched a plan to open a ski shop in their hometown. At that time there were two other ski shops within 3 miles of where they planned to open Ski Depot—most people thought they were crazy. Maybe some were right, but they did it anyway. With 40 pairs of skis, and not many more boots, they opened up their first location in an old train station a half mile from where they grew up. With enough change to fill the cash register drawer, they kicked off their first year in business. That first season they sold half of the skis on the rack and ended up skiing on the rest. On Wednesday’s they would put the “Closed, Gone Skiing” sign in the window and chalk it up to “product testing.” Things were about to change drastically… The next few seasons were challenging ones. Lack of snow, learning curves, and working “real jobs” to pay the bills made it seem overwhelming at times. That being said, Ski Depot quickly became the local’s favorite ski shop and their reputation for customer service and expert knowledge spread around the state with great results. At the time, Ron’s real job was in electronics and instrumentation. Seeing that the internet was becoming a force in the retail world, he realized that Ski Depot needed a domain name and website. In hindsight, that was a very smart move—they sold their first pair of skis online in 1998 and have never looked back. Ski Depot quickly became known around the country as a leader in race ski sales. The brothers expanded that knowledge and success into the recreational side of ski sales as well. Since then, they have been a driving force in online ski and accessories sales and service. Kenny and Ron have also had the privilege of working with John Howe building skis. John was a key part of Head and Atomic from the 60’s through the 80’s and is still called upon frequently by ski companies throughout the industry for his expertise. For several years, the brothers worked with John to build The Claw, the precursor to all of the vibration damping systems found in skis today. Kenny and Ron’s experience in ski building has helped give credibility to the knowledge they share about the construction of skis. Although they no longer produce skis, they still install The Claw vibration damping plate on flat profile skis from time to time. Over the last 16 years, Ron and Kenny have devoted all of their energy to this way of life that only a skier can fully appreciate. Ron is the technical brain at Ski Depot and is the man behind the curtain for online sales and service. Kenny is the voice of Ski Depot and handles the operations side of the business. Together they have built Ski Depot into a family business with a loyal following across the country and worldwide. Skiing has taken them across the country and to Europe for great skiing and education. The brothers continue to learn and grow so that they can keep their customers informed and equipped with the best gear to suit them and their families. They thank everyone that has given them support over the years and welcome new friends that share the same passion for skiing that they do.They’ll see you on the hill… Community Outreach The team at Ski Depot is very active in our community. We all live in the same area and are involved in a number of different volunteer organizations and activities. Everyone at the shop takes great pride in giving back to the place that we call home. We support our local Special Olympians in any way we can. Spruce Mtn. Ski Slope is our home hill and we wouldn’t be who we are today without it. Almost everyone at Ski Depot grew up on the hill and has given back to the club through coaching, making snow, and selling grilled cheese sandwiches in the lodge. We also volunteer with several other civic organizations throughout the area from our veterans organizations, many local charities, food banks, and cleaning up trash from local parks and roads. Being able to make our living in the town that most of us grew up in, makes it a natural feeling to want to give back to our community.
