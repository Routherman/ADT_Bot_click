To change perception about local beer, it’s essential to delve deep into the local history regarding beer and the stories behind breweries like Little Miami. This blog post shows how Little Miami Brewing Company has grown from a small company into a local institution. We’ll trace the key moments, innovations, and unique beers that defined its legacy. Origins of Little Miami Brewing Company It began with a shared dream among friends who cherished exceptional beer. Founded in 2015 by Dan Lynch and Joe Brenner, Little Miami Brewing Company emerged as their vision of a place where quality beer and community spirit could converge. And this vision was very clear: brewing exceptional craft beers while hosting with warmth whoever comes to visit their city. The founders were inspired by the natural beauty and rich history of the Little Miami River, which led to the name of the brewery and continued to be a source of inspiration. The first location, right in the heart of Milford, was chosen for its historic value and beauty. This location not only gave an ideal backdrop for a brewery, but it also represented the past coming to life again in the present, deepening the threads of the Little Miami Brewing Company story. Early Days of Brewing We knew we had the brewing of beer nailed because joe was a friend of Jim Strelau, a 30 year veteran of the Cincinnati Brewery scene and experience in Colorado and Arizona. Jim had the beer experience down! Notwithstanding, the company faced its own set of problems. Like sourcing ingredients and fine-tuning their brewing process to ramp up production. Still, refusing to compromise on quality, the hard times were pushed through, culminating in the brewery’s expansion. Expansion and Growth As the word got out about the great beers at Little Miami Brewing Company, demand increased their need to expand. Key milestones marking the growth of the brewery included new steps along the way. The first large expansion deal was that of the new varieties of beers. Understanding the taste buds of their customers, Little Miami experimented with different ale styles and flavour profiles. Among others, the more famous beers created were Grateful IPA with bold and hoppy flavours and Magpie Amber Ale with rich malty flavour. To know more about the types of beers offered Click Here This was a direct investment in the brewing facility itself to increase output. Putting in new tanks and brewing equipment meant bigger batches and more consistent production. This growth enabled the brewery to maintain the high standards that had become its hallmark. Well, this expansion was not just to effect an increase in production; it also entailed enhancing the overall customer experience. The inside area of their taproom had been expanded to include a rooftop bar and  to provide a larger space with the normal rustic decor that bespoke warmth and classically reflected its heritage. Community Involvement Since its start, Little Miami Brewing Company has demonstrated serious commitment to the local community. Since the  inception there has been a realization that the goodwill and support of their neighbours will be pivotal.LMBC has donated to over 400 orgainzations since it opened in it’s Give Back Wednesdays. And so the brewery regularly sponsors local events and collaborates with other local businesses to foster community. This gets the brewery’s beers in front of people at events while tying the business into local culture. On top of this, Little Miami Brewing Company keeps itself involved in local initiatives, supporting environmental and educational causes. Such involvement by the brewery resonates with making a positive difference beyond brewing great beer. Brewing Innovations Innovation has been a part of Little Miami Brewing Company’s brewing philosophy since its very establishment. The founders seek out new technology and rare techniques for brewing to keep them one step ahead in the competitive craft beer market. Little Miami Brewing Company is proud of its unique recipes, most of them inspired by traditional brewing techniques but with a modern twist. For example, its Junkyard Dog includes the perfect mix of local ingredients with some exotic hops to achieve that fun taste hundreds of people love. It’s their brewing history that influences their innovations, placed inside so many of their beers. Classic styles are often paid homage to while looking to push the boundaries of what can be done in craft brewing. This blend of tradition with innovation marks Little Miami Brewing Company’s style. Signature Beers and Their Stories A signature series of beers, all telling and unique, have been crafted by Little Miami Brewing Co. These beers represent more than just a product; rather, they tell of creativity and the commitment to quality at the brewery. Probably one of the most popular beers is its Grateful, an IPA with a strikingly bronze color and powerful flavour. The story behind this beer is just as interesting as the beer itself. It was developed during a brainstorming session when the brewers wanted to create something which would be both striking in appearance and taste. The result of what happened there became a customer favourite very fast. A fruity IPA brewed with a famous San Francisco yeast strain and a massive amount of American hops (Cascade, Centennial, and and dry hopped with Mosaic) for a piney, citrusy hit of goodness. Another signature beer is their Curveball Beer, which is an Summer Wheat beer but with a bit of a twist. The Curveball Beer was actually a beer in development that really pushed the envelope on ingredients used and brewing techniques in order to create something people would not expect at all. It’s called Curveball because it was brewed during COVID which threw us all kinds of curveballs! Classic Belgian Wit brewed with orange peel and coriander. It’s light, refreshing and the perfect beer to sip on while watching baseball! These signature beers are not just seasonal; they are tantamount to staples in their lineup, with each finding a following. Their stories of creation enhance their appeal, making them not only beverages but pieces of the brewery’s history itself.

Derek Smith 13:26 06 Oct 24 Had the pizza and pretzels. Very good. Awesome atmosphere. Tom Kent 19:31 23 Sep 24 Kimberly Curran 12:29 23 Sep 24 Love the food and vibe! Brian Hubert 15:30 10 Sep 24 Good thing they have room.  This place got seriously busy while we were there.  The beer was fantastic.  We didn't plan on staying long, but our plan failed.  Nice rooftop seating area as well as a ground floor area outside. Mike Stoehr 21:51 05 Sep 24 Great place to grab a beer and some food pizza.  You can dine inside, on the outside patio or grab an Adirondack chair along the riverbank.  Lots to see on the river as you relax or work having a cold one.  The brew meister and those making the beer know what they are doing and take great pride in putting out great beers.  The food is also good so you cannot go wrong.  Enjoy your visit! Lauren Martin 20:54 04 Sep 24 This is my favorite spot in the cincy area. The views being right on Little Miami just can’t be beat. We came by on a weekend with my babies & sat in the outdoor chairs and enjoyed the atmosphere for a couple hours.  They have both beer AND cocktail choices. I got a cherry beer that was delicious. Loved it here so much that I drove 30 min to have coffee with my baby a few days later. Workers there are so friendly. You can tell they like being there as well. The set up is just amazing. Definitely going to continue bringing out of town guests here. Thomas Holland 17:05 01 Sep 24 Little Miami Brewing Company is a standout destination in the heart of Milford, Ohio. Whether you're a craft beer enthusiast or just looking for a great place to unwind, this spot has it all. Their beer selection is top-notch, with a variety of flavors that cater to all palates, and the food is equally impressive, perfectly complementing your drink of choice.What truly sets Little Miami Brewing apart, though, is its unbeatable atmosphere. The outdoor seating area offers breathtaking views of the Little Miami River, making it the perfect place to enjoy nature while sipping on a cold brew. The rooftop deck is another highlight, providing a fun and relaxed vibe with stunning vistas, while the indoor seating offers a cool escape during hotter days.The ambiance is lively and welcoming, with friendly people and a laid-back charm that makes you feel right at home. Milford itself is a beautiful town, and a visit to Little Miami Brewing Company is a must whether you're exploring the area or planning a brewery tour. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a memorable experience in a picturesque setting! Jeff Williamson Group - Cincinnati Realtor 02:13 02 Aug 24 Love the nachos and pizza. Been coming here for years. But, writing a review today bc you brought in a good musically talented friend, Bobby Crawford acoustic. It was nice having a good friend i know well come and play at one of my favorite venues. Glad you all made this happen Ken Gibson 21:47 07 Jul 24 What a fantastic place. I've driven by it many times but never had the opportunity to visit until today. Met up with two lifelong friends and had a great time catching up over drinks on the rooftop before devouring delicious tacos while sitting on the river bank. The most relaxed I have been all summer. About us GREAT BEER. GREAT PIZZA. \nGREAT PLACE TO BE. LMBC Pizza starts with hand-tossed dough that is made fresh daily from imported Italian flour and freshly grated cheeses then brick oven baked with the finest quality ingredients for toppings.

Art, in imagining what beer can be. Whether it’s excellent versions of classic styles, or boundary pushing experimental brews, Bainbridge Brewing blends the art and science of beer. Craft beer is also a social beverage and the Taproom and Alehouse are part of our culture here in the Northwest. The local brewery is part of the fabric of the community, giving it character, individuality, and indeed, an air of hometown pride. Bainbridge Brewing is the island’s brewery, and the island is as much a part of us as we are of it. Opened in 2012, the Bainbridge Island Brewing Company operates the Brewery & Taproom at Coppertop Park, and the Bainbridge Brewing Alehouse in Downtown Winslow. The Company is co-owned by Chuck and Russell Everett and Rob Frease. Brewmaster Russell Everett, Brewmaster/Co-Owner, was raised on the island and is a graduate of Bainbridge High, the University of Washington, and the University of Miami. Like many brewers, he started as a avid homebrewer and went pro. Russell says a great beer is about so many things. But suffice it to say, he likes a beer that’s done well: free of faults, well balanced, served right, and just what you’re looking for. And while his brewing philosophy is to always make it well, he’s not afraid to experiment. Case in point – the brewery’s Sandbox Series experimental beers. As an award-winning Brewmaster, he’s always enjoyed using new ingredients, trying out new brewing methods, and using new flavors. Russell is always perfecting the classic year round and seasonal beer styles that the brewery produces. At the same time, the brewery also makes some interesting one-off’s, barrel-aged beers, and sours. So keep an eye on what’s up next!

With nearly 20 years of collective experience in the craft beer industry, we're focused on brewing and serving high-quality craft beers in a family-friendly atmosphere in the heart of downtown Manhattan. This town is our home, and we want to bring the best possible beer experience and education to the wonderful people of Manhattan. We want to create a place for everyone to come out and have a good time with friends and cultivate a craft beer culture Manhattan can be proud of. Our Team The best and brightest Co-Owners Portraits by Killian Millner Adam Krebsbach Brewer A native of Norton, Kansas, who moved to Manhattan in 2006, Adam's unrelenting creative energy has resulted in a tasty variety of imaginative beers. A tinkerer at heart, Adam is the yin to Garrett's yang; for every traditional style brewed by Garrett, you'll find Adam experimenting with an array of unique ingredients into his beers to challenge and delight beer fans. Adam loves drinking American pale ales, robust porters and Belgian tripels. Garrett Paulman Brewer A professionally trained brewer from the renowned Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Garrett also brings experience in facility management and quality control. Garrett started brewing in 2011 before making the leap to attend Siebel and \"turn pro\" in 2012. You will find Garrett drinking anything hoppy while laughing with friends, family and strangers at the bar. Although he's a Nebraska native, Garrett, his wife and two children are K-State fans in training. Jake Voegeli Sales & Marketing A former K-State football player from Wichita, Kansas, who bleeds purple with his wife and daughter, Jake's journey into craft beer began in college after committing himself to trying a new six pack each week. Jake loves to challenge his palate with hoppy IPAs, sours and barrel-aged stouts, but also loves a well-crafted, delicate pilsner or a traditional English brown ale. An experienced salesman and marketer both in the craft beer and spirits industries, you'll mostly see Jake up front slinging beers or chatting with guests about beer, K-State football, his favorite Ryan Bingham album or his daughter Chloe.
