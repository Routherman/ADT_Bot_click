History: In 2000, a massive boulder of Jade was discovered in the arctic circle of Canada. Consisting of 18 tons of gemstone quality jade, it was called “the find of the millennium” and was given the name “Polar Pride.” Over the next five years professional carvers and artists sculpted and hand-carved the 5-ton Jade boulder into a spectacular 7-foot high Buddha, including the lotus and throne. Today, the magnificent and spiritual icon is honored as a wonder in the present-day world. Green Tara unveiled for her first showing in USA via @JadeBuddhaPeace ChakraSamvara , Unity is Change and the City of Miami are honored to host the 2014 Tour of the Jade Buddha for Universal Peace.

      "text": "Miami Friends of the Japanese Garden   » • About the Friends Miami Friends of the Japanese Garden Ichimura Miami-Japan Garden • About the Friends FRIENDS OF THE JAPANESE GARDEN’S GOALS ARE: • Introduce the Garden to the citizens at large through various public festivals and events. • Restore the cleansing reservoir and redesign the sinking water purification pool. • Install a deck for easy access to the water in the pond. • Encourage use of the Garden by Garden Clubs, artists, musicians and other groups. THANKS TO THESE 2021 SUPPORTERS: Stephan Eberhagen YOU CAN VOLUNTEER IN THE GARDEN We need members and volunteers in order to attain our goals. All areas of work are available for potential members. The work could range from actual gardening to more of an organizational assignment or public relations/fund raising part of our future. Incorporated in 1984 as a non-profit, 501 (C)3 organization, Friends of the Japanese Garden was, at that time, a group of volunteers dedicated to salvaging and restoring SAN-AI-EN (Three Loves Garden) to its original splendor following a period when the Garden maintenance was neglected for lack funds. Also, during this period of neglect, an influx of homeless began to use the Garden and the Teahouse as their home which resulted in significant destruction and deterioration of the property. Members of Friends of the Japanese Garden (FJG) dedicated every weekend to repairing the Garden. They began to pull weeds – some weeds exceeding the heights of the members. They then unearthed a pond beneath the thick growth and discovered a foot of sludge that needed to be removed. The work seemed unending. However, all of the work was a true labor of love for these workers as they envisioned a newly restored SAN-AI-EN. Beginning in 1984 and continuing for several years following, Friends of the Japanese Garden decided to hold annual Spring Festivals in early May. While the Garden was not in usable condition, the City of Miami gave FJG permission to use the adjacent grassy field to hold the Festival. The City of Miami provided a large stage on wheels for shows. The shows included Taiko drummers, Martial arts, Japanese Dance and Bonsai demonstrations among other cultural acts. In addition, tents were rented for between 30 to 40 vendors of Asian food and products. The focus for the group now became introduction of Japanese culture through events at the Garden and sometimes at venues away from the Garden such as classical Japanese Dancers and professional Koto players in concerts at Miami Dade Junior College. Following the devastation the Garden suffered from Hurricane Andrew, FJG paid a commercial gardener to do the minimum maintenance for the Garden. But, the Garden was eventually closed by the City of Miami in 1997 when the City leased 18 acres of land (including the Japanese Garden acreage) to Parrot Jungle for a theme park to be called Jungle Island. The City promised to move and rebuild the Japanese Garden to another site east of the new theme park. With the advent of the new Garden, ICHIMURA MIAMI JAPAN GARDEN, opened in 2005, the role of FJG gained a new perspective. Along with planning cultural events at the Garden, FJG took on the assignment of bringing in authentic Japanese elements to this Garden. The first item was the acquisition of a new Stone Lantern from Japan. Presently, this is the only perfect stone lantern in the Garden. The many art objects which had adorned the original Garden no longer existed. Much more work awaits the Friends of the Japanese Garden in the new Garden, the most ambitious and important of which is the building of a Teahouse! Friends of the Japanese Garden Performing Artists We pride ourselves in the fact that over the years we have brought many unique acts to entertain at the Garden. However we do have some “regular” performers at each event. I’m talking about the Yoshiko Taiko Dojo Drummers. Fernando Moraes, Gretchen Schmidt & Karen Bowie have been entertaining audiences at the Garden for the past five years and are a “favorite” amongst the audience. We have also added drummers Danielle & Claudio Ponce to our performers. Another crowd pleaser is the Florida Cosplay, Anime/Manga costume show and contest. Ms. Sara Comettant and her Cosplayers responded to our offer to have her group perform at our events. Over the past two year we have witnessed a large increase in attendance by young adults. Other guest performers include Shinto Priest, Masafumi Nakanishi. Masafumi has been to the Garden three years to conduct the Thanksgiving and 7-5-3 Coming of Age ceremonies. Mr. Nakanishi’s performance at the Japanese Garden was the first of its kind in North America. This year the FJG was honored to host Internationally renowned artist Huong’s Peace Mural. Master Magician, Shoot Ogawa of Japan has performed. Shoot is a World Renown Sleight of Hand Artist who was on Tour and made his only South Florida appearance at the Garden. In 2015 the Garden was host to the seven ton Jade Buddha statue. Accompanied by Buddist Monks, the statue attracted thousands of visitors from all over the world! The Kaito Brothers, who live in Japan made their USA Debut at our Festival. University of Miami, School of Music student, Ms. Ellen Ogihara delighted the audience with beautiful violin. Ellen was accompanied by fellow student Cellist, Vienna Sa. The Kuniko Theater Group has come from their show in Epcot to entertain South Florida families at the Garden too. Japanese Storyteller Ms. Ohare enchants the children both young and old with her whimsical tails of Life in Japan. Mr. Frank Nieves, President and Founder of the Institute for Budo Studies is our newest artist to volunteer his services. He is accomplished in several of the Martial Arts. His debut was at our May 14th, 2017 Spring Festival. Frank demonstrated Iaido, which is an ancient “Quick Draw” sword art developed during the “Warring States Period”, (1500’s) and remains an integral part of Japanese martial arts society ever since it’s creation. Friends of the Japanese Garden Officers, Board Members and Member Volunteers Agnes Youngblood is the Executive Director, Emeritus and founder of the Friends of the Japanese Garden. Agnes has a successful record of producing concerts and events at the Japanese Garden. She is a fund raiser, promoter, cheer leader and watch dog for the garden. I truly believe if it weren’t for Agnes, there would be no garden. Rick Del Vecchio is the President of the Friends of the Japanese Garden and is the Chairman of all FJG Programs. Rick also helps write the grants and is a Fundraiser. Akiko Iwata is a professional landscape architect, who specializes in Japanese Garden design. She is assisting us in our work with the City of Miami, to upgrade the Garden design. Mieko Kubota , native Japanese, is a World Master of Ikebana. In 2012, she was elected the Artist-in-Residence by History-Miami Museum. She is winner of the Florida Folk Heritage award in 2010. She has been the Japanese Language Instructor at Miami-Dade College. Mieko received Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs award in 2004 for great contributions and devoted activities for cultural and educational exchange and understanding between Japan and U.S. She was also the Honoree of Miami-Dade County’s “In the Company of Women” in 2006. Mieko has been active member of FJG since 1978 where she provides educational demonstrations in the traditional art of Ikebana. Mieko is also a board member of Japan/America Society of South Florida. Robert Young has been teaching Okinawan Goju Ryu Karate for over 30 years. Robert joined the Japanese Gardens nearly 5 years ago at the request of the then president and student Mrs. Agnes Youngblood. Robert serves as our Martial Arts Expert and Consultant. He produces our Martial Arts, Music, Magic and More each January. This event demonstrates and enlightens the public to the many benefits of the various disciplines of the treasured martial arts. Michiyo Ishii Sloane moved from Yokosuka, Japan to Oceanside, CA in 1983. In 1998 Michiyo moved with her family to Miami, Florida. Michiyo recruits and manages our student volunteer program. She also provides traditional Japanese cooking demonstrations, coordinates the Children’s educational and cultural activities and manages the Food concession stand.

History: In 2000, a massive boulder of Jade was discovered in the arctic circle of Canada. Consisting of 18 tons of gemstone quality jade, it was called “the find of the millennium” and was given the name “Polar Pride.” Over the next five years professional carvers and artists sculpted and hand-carved the 5-ton Jade boulder into a spectacular 7-foot high Buddha, including the lotus and throne. Today, the magnificent and spiritual icon is honored as a wonder in the present-day world. Green Tara unveiled for her first showing in USA via @JadeBuddhaPeace ChakraSamvara , Unity is Change and the City of Miami are honored to host the 2014 Tour of the Jade Buddha for Universal Peace.

      "text": "Miami Friends of the Japanese Garden   » • History of the Garden Miami Friends of the Japanese Garden Ichimura Miami-Japan Garden • History of the Garden In 1957, Mr. Kiyoshi Ichimura, Founder of Ricoh Corporation of Japan, attended a camera exhibition and show in the United States. On his way from Japan to the exhibition, he stopped in Miami. Looking east from his hotel room, he was stunned by the beauty of the city.  He noticed one nearby area of land that appeared vacant and idle. Mr. Ichimura remarked to the American gentleman standing next to him that it would be wonderful if hundreds of cherry trees could be planted there with a great number of standing lanterns interspersed among them. The American gentleman, who happened to be a Miami city commissioner, responded to the remark with a question, “Are you willing to donate them?” Mr. Ichimura answered without hesitation,”Yes, any time, if you wish.” Soon after, Mr. Ichimura received a phone call from the Mayor of Miami inquiring about the seriousness of his remarks. The Mayor reportedly said, “We will accept your gift wholeheartedly; however, we will need some preparation time to be ready to accept such a generous gift.” The following year, when Mr. Ichimura attended the camera show, he again stopped in Miami and took the opportunity to present to the City of Miami an intended list of gifts. Sadly, it was determined that the climate in Miami was unsuited for cherry trees and furthermore that cherry trees could possibly carry a bacteria that prohibited their importation. Mr. Ichimura immediately offered to donate 300 orchid trees which grew in Central China. These trees, after being accepted by the City of Miami, were planted along “Ichimura Road” which runs parallel to the MacArthur Causeway. Following this donation, he sent an 8-foot-tall Kasuga Stone Lantern and a 15- foot tall Hotei statue. Finally, he sent 10 Japanese carpenters and numerous Japanese gardeners.  The building of the authentic Japanese Garden began in earnest. On this little piece of land, Mr. Ichimura wanted to infuse an authentic Japanese cultural atmosphere and thus built a no-nail Azumaya (resting spot) as well as a teahouse named SAN-AI-AN. All work was completed in November of 1961. The garden was named SAN-AI-EN, “Three Loves Garden.” The Gift Commemorative Ceremony was attended by both Mr. and Mrs. Kiyoshi Ichimura after the completion of the Garden in 1961.  At the Gift Commemorative Ceremony, a congratulatory message from President Kennedy was conveyed and Mr. Ichimura was made an honorary Citizen of the City of Miami. On that occasion, Mr. Ichimura expressed his most sincere feeling of satisfaction that he had been fortunate enough to be able to contribute in a small way to the friendship between the United States  and Japan. By 1984, twenty-three years after that memorable day in the life of the Garden, SAN-AI-EN had spiraled into total disrepair and neglect. At this time, circumstances brought the Vice President of Ricoh Americas, Mr. Hiroshi Inouye, to Miami. At a luncheon, he met the Director of the City of Miami Department of Parks and Recreation and Mrs. Agnes Youngblood, President of the Friends of the Japanese Garden. Mrs. Youngblood explained the recent development of the non-profit organization, Friends of the Japanese Garden, to Mr. Inouye, who relayed the details to Mr. Hideo Yoshida, the Director of the General Secretariat of SAN-AI-KAI (the office which oversees the subsidiaries and all Ricoh-related companies).  Mr. Hideo Yoshida, in turn, informed Shin-ichi Miyoshi, the Chairman of the Board, and thus began an enduring relationship between Mr. Miyoshi and the Friends of the Japanese Garden. In 1987, Chairman Miyoshi visited Miami to initiate the conversation for a joint project to rebuild the Garden. The project was completed in December of 1988. On August 24, 1992, category 5 Hurricane Andrew devastated Miami Dade County and destroyed the Japanese Garden along with over 250,000 homes and businesses throughout the county.   It took 3 years to restore everything in the Garden. On April 21, 1995, the Mayor of Miami, Chairman of the Board of SAN-AI-KAI, Vice President Mr. Inouye, and about 100 members from the City of Miami and Japan attended the celebration of the completion of the restoration of the SAN-AI-EN. This event was written up in the local newspapers and viewed on the local television stations. In 1996, the City of Miami Commission voted to approve the permanent move of Parrot Jungle to Watson Island. This decision necessitated the move of the Japanese Garden to a new location, east of Parrot Jungle. The construction of the new Garden took several years. Finally, April 29, 2004, witnessed the official opening of the new Japanese Garden, renamed ICHIMURA-EN. The official complete name is now ICHIMURA MIAMI JAPAN GARDEN. April 29th is Green Day in the United States.  This opening date for the Garden was chosen to celebrate the natural beauty of the Garden, the value of green in our lives, and also the birthday of the Japanese Emperor Showa. Since then, the Friends of the Japanese Garden celebrate Green Day/Spring Festival every year at the Garden. ICHIMURA-EN is administered by the City of Miami Department of Parks and Recreation. The Friends of the Japanese Garden is the official Advisory Body that works closely with the City Department of Parks and also oversees the appropriateness of the Garden’s maintenance. The Friends of the Japanese Garden are constantly looking for ways to bring more Japanese elements to this beloved Garden. Almost 50 years have passed since the opening of the Garden. The Garden, which bears the name of the Founder of Ricoh Corporation, still exists and is well cared for. RICOH / SAN-AI GROUP expresses deep appreciation to those members of the Friends of the Japanese Garden who show continued support and dedication.
