Thank you to everyone who joined us—industry leaders, change-makers and managers alike—and shared insights that helped us tackle the biggest challenges facing pubs, restaurants and bars today.\n\nOur conversations highlighted the pressures on hospitality, but more importantly, they ignited fresh thinking around the creation of new opportunities, innovation and strategies to keep doors open and profits healthy. Insights from Mark Smith from Zonal , Eloise Mayer of AB InBev and Sandra Kelly of UKHospitality provided much-needed awareness from cross-sections of the industry. We were also pleased to host Christopher Hinchliff (MP). It is reassuring to note that industry discussions such as these are on the radar of those who can help make the changes. \n\nCollaboration—from country pubs and small-town bars to restaurants, EPOS providers and distilleries—will be crucial if we want to adapt and thrive in these uncertain times. To keep the momentum going, we encourage you to follow UKHospitality and stay connected to the initiatives they champion. As one of the UK’s largest employment sectors, our collective voice must be heard by those making long-term decisions.\n\nWe’re excited to continue this dialogue and explore new partnerships that will help us beat the trend and shape the future of hospitality. Please share your key takeaways or upcoming projects in the comments—we’d love to hear how you’re driving change in your corner of the industry!
