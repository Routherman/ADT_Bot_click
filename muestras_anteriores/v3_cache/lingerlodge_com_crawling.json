Linger Lodge’s history has been in the making for 76 years (since 1945!). It has withstood many owners, each adding their own charm to create the special place we call the Linger Lodge today. The original cabin (and its original owners behind the counter) in 1951. 1945 Linger Lodge is founded by the Parvin family, starting out as a two-story log cabin overlooking the Braden River, surrounded by 100 acres of land fit for fishing, canoeing and camping. The original cabin burns down in the late 1950s. 1968 Linger Lodge is bought by Frank and Elaine Gamsky, a couple from Milwaukee, WI. Frank, a veterinarian, begins decorating the Lodge with taxidermied wild game and roadkill from around the grounds. 2016 Linger Lodge is bought in 2016 by the Hartl Family from Austria, after falling in love with the property’s unique charm. Since then, they have been investing in improving the grounds to preserve and enhance the Lodge’s Old Florida appeal. 2022 The Linger Lodge RV Park opens after 2 years of renovations with new amenities & features, but with the same Old Florida feel.

Big thanks to the Linger Lodge RV Team, you do an excellent job! Everything is so clean and everybody is so friendly!  We stayed at Linger Lodge RV Park for the first time and will definitely be back! We enjoyed every minute. The place was very clean, we loved the pool. The management was very accommodating and helpful. It was very nice to chat with him, he helped us find our lot and accommodate our trailer. We came late and he checked on us several times to make sure that we had everything we needed. We stayed on a River Site#37. Just be aware you are next to the River, there will be mosquitos at night.

My husband enjoyed the pool table in the Clubhouse. And we loved the restaurant on site, great food and a wonderful view. We will definitely be back! What a treasure! Month of Visit May Share Report Kathryn H. Traveler Reviewed Jun. 29, 2023 A TON OF MONEY, LACKING EXECUTION I really dislike it when people give our country a bad rap for capitalism, though it is not perfect, things like reviews can help others as a social currency. Linger Lodge RV Park lost my review on Google and has engaged in extreme market exploitation through falsely advertising their campground and even acting as customers themselves online. So here my review is again. A summary for my long review of Linger Lodge RV Park and our 5 month experience there is: A TON OF MONEY, LACKING EXECUTION. That being said, they obviously thought about the market, as they were able to take advantage of the demand for a campground in the area, exploiting it through ridiculously high pricing. We stayed 5 months through peak season, which cost us$18k. That's a$3600/mo/avg. We chose a\"river site\" over a\"jungle site.\" This was a mistake, as it cost more, and there was absolutely no river view. It was 30 ft of overgrown, what I would call\"jungle,\" to the water. The jungle spots, closely located across the road as all the sites are smashed together, had maybe 2 palms a piece. How misleading, we had no view, lots of insects, our neighbors had a rattler in their yard one day, and then the jungle spots had no shade with some of the spots even facing each other(better like your neighbor because you are grilling with them!). Management was ok, but the one everyone called the owner, Fritz, was not and gave us the run around about everything. He gets upset if you can't understand his broken English and is very dismissive at times. At one point, as the season was winding down and leaving a lot of open spaces, he told me,\"Look, what am I supposed to do? I can't kick someone out,\" whilst pointing at the many vacant spots. We had a problem with some trashy neighbors who the manager even said was reported a few times. When asked about why some people were getting their river site cleared and we weren't, after supporting them for 3 months, we got the answer that\"it was a process\" and I bet it is still grown over. The better half of management seemed a little more level-headed and thoughtful. Even with that, while I have a feeling most of the following issues were not the purview of the before mentioned better half, we found gross mismanagement everywhere. I am not normally this picky, but we were paying good money for a supposed resort! Anyways, many trees are dead or dying around the campground. The bathroom was hastily constructed, possibly giving someone in need of support terrible problems. The few washers, which you had to pay for, were often broken and wouldn't come close to supporting the whole campground(picture). There was never enough dumpsters, even though they only used 1 of 2 designated spots, even when at capacity in peak season(picture). The pads for the sites are set up for Class As, with the little pad towards the front of the spot, not lining up with most other camper doors. There was no room for vehicles, not even barely enough for your pulling rig. The campground is tight, and many people had to find their way into their spots by going through other sites, something that could not be done at full capacity(picture). Oftentimes, no one would be escorting campers either. The pool was often unkempt with trash around. The workout area lacked equipment and was not clean. The dog park has unsafe conditions, only remedied with a laughable picnic table solution(picture). The older grounds keeper would mow without any regard for what he was running over or shooting across the campground. Something that actually favored us, as we had a canopy up and rugs down is the rules are many, but many are not enforced. It seems to be one if those things that can work for you or against you, so deal with that how you will. One thing I will say, this younger guy, Daniel, is why this review is even 3 stars. MANAGEMENT needs to know who they have there. Guy spoke well with me about concerns, and we always saw him working. He will make this park better. Now, most of the staff was friendly. Most eveything is new and hopefully will be kept up. It was nice to use the pool and half gym. We will never come back here again. With the poor management, lack of customer care, false representation, and pricing for subpar grounds, I hope others leave more honest reviews, as many of these better reviews are for shorts stays.

Your RV is a great option if you bring your friends or family along. RV campers help you enjoy the comfort of private space as you explore some of Florida's unique landscapes. Most people enjoy driving on the open road on their vacation. Likewise, traveling in an RV with your family gives you a chance to get more spontaneous. A night in the woods can be fun for you and the kids as you watch the beautiful Florida night sky. What Should You Consider When Finding an RV Park? Planning is one of the most important aspects of any trip, and finding an RV resort can make or break your adventure. In most cases, campers have to compromise comforts to enjoy some important amenities on vacation. You must keep a few things in mind when looking for a campsite in Bradenton. Choose the Right Location Are you looking for easy access to the town or city? Most RV parks are located on the outskirts of suburban areas. Though going out of town is ideal for most outdoor lovers, it can be inconvenient if you need to refuel or stock up on groceries. It is always important to find an RV resort destination with easy access to explore Bradenton during the day. Likewise, if you want to get in touch with nature, you must find a park that lets you enjoy basic amenities. Electricity, water, and bathroom facilities are important to enhance your camping experience. Linger Lodge RV Park is located a few minutes' drive from Bradenton. The short trip lets you see some of the town's best sites. After a fun-filled day of exploring, you can always head to the park to relax in wild Florida. What is Your Personal Preference? Everyone has their taste. For outdoor adventurers, getting the raw feeling of nature is crucial for their extended stay in the woods. However, this is not always the case for newbies. If you have a large RV, you need a campsite that offers considerable parking for your vehicle. In addition, you also need space to set up your camp without getting into anyone's space. Always check to see if the park offers ample RV accommodation before heading to Bradenton. In addition, you might be looking for a little alone time with your family. Crowded parks can be uncomfortable for people looking for privacy. Huge RV parks are ideal for vacationers looking for some seclusion. What is Your Budget? How much are you willing to pay during the trip? Vacationing can be expensive if you consider all the activities and exploring you will be doing. First, traveling in an RV is always cheaper than checking into a hotel for any long-term period. However, finding an affordable resort can help reduce your expenses. Likewise, finding a campsite that offers different activities and amenities will also save on the overall cost of your trip to Bradenton. Our RV Park offers affordable prices for any RVers looking to spend a few weeks in Florida. Contact us to get an estimated cost of your vacation cost. We currently allow stays for up to 6 months at one time! What Kind of Amenities Do You Find in The Park? If you want to stay in the Florida woods for a few days or weeks, you need to find an RV camp with proper amenities and facilities. Clubhouses or restaurants are excellent places to enjoy a meal and relax after a long day of excursion in Bradenton. You get to enjoy some tasty delights, freshly prepaid to your liking. You can also enjoy some drinks as you wait. Hygiene is also important to consider if you will stay long in the camp. You need a proper bathhouse that provides clean and individual washrooms and showers to freshen up after an excursion. Linger Lodge is the place to go if you own an RV or want to rent one for a trip to Bradenton. We offer services for short-term and long-term campers who want to experience Florida's calm and quiet life. Is the Park Family and Pet Friendly? A safe and secure environment is important if you plan to camp with your kids and pets. In addition, you might prefer a little privacy to commune with nature. Whichever your preference, you need an RV park that has a safe and private community. Huge playing grounds allow your kids to socialize. Under supervision, they can roam around the park and visit some breathtaking sceneries along the Braden River. Campfires and get-togethers are also a nice way for parents to create a network across the country. You get to interact with people when the park has social events freely. There is no need to leave your pets at home. Pet-friendly RV parks provide a safe environment for your cat or dog to roam around without a leash. Interacting with other people and pets helps improve your pet's personality and confidence. The resort you choose should be able to fulfill all these social needs you need for your long-term stay in Bradenton. Fun Activities to Do Your RV camp should also have recreational activities for you and your family. Some resorts have a variety of fun-filled activities that you can take advantage of. Whether you prefer hiking, canoeing, or biking, you have various options that can enhance your experience during your long vacation. Likewise, some RV parks provide fun learning activities that long-term campers enjoy. Social events, travel lectures, or puzzle games are excellent ways to keep your mind distracted after a long day in the summer weather. Exercising is also a fun activity to do as a family. Some RV parks offer exercise classes like yoga for anyone willing to try it. If you are lucky enough, you can also find a gym in the resort that can help you improve your fitness when you decide to extend your vacation trip to Bradenton. Linger Lodge offers these and more.

Not a lick of shade to be had which sucks because this whole area used to be covered in trees. They bulldozed a whole bunch of old Florida to make an RV parking lot baking in the sun. No thanks.

It is an old but updated fishing camp with a restaurant that is museum quality and the food is second to none in the restaurant (price is equal to every where else).  The camp accepts a wide range of campers and units. They do not cull you if your unit is not glass shinny brand new. NOTE:  They will be closing May 2019 for a  $1.5 million upgrade including pools, new pads and meeting places and bath houses. They are planning on leaving nature along and working around her. I like that. Prices will have to double but they will still be the less expensive in the area. RV parks in the area are not worth $160 a night. Anyway, we loved our stay and the folks there. Please check ahead because the upgrading will take 10 to 12 months.

This was after calling a few other places who laughed at me and told me they were booked solid until April. But this place is actually, the sites are nice and spacious and there’s a feeling of nature surrounding you rather than a parking lot. There’s access to the river where you can rent kayaks and there’s a restaurant with pretty good food and regular entertainment. Turns out they had availability because they were planning to close for renovations but the permits didn’t come through in time so they reopened the calendar last minute. The bathrooms were being renovated so they had a trailer in the parking lot instead. You are close to stores and shopping (and the family we were there to visit) but a good 30-45 minutes from the beach. No issues with cell service on AT&T so we never checked Verizon- but you’re in the middle of suburbia so I would assume all carriers with fine.

The warm weather and nature give it a remarkable ambiance, making it the best vacation destination for you and your family. The Braden River is within the Manatee River Watershed. Located between Bradenton and Sarasota, the river is home to various plant life and animals native to Florida. In the nice summer Florida weather, you will be thrilled to find the little hidden gems and treasures of the Braden River. From the spectacular landscape to the serene waters, let us look at some of the fun activities you can experience on your vacation. Boat Tours The scenic river offers breath-taking views that you can only experience in the comfort of a boat. Paddling upstream on the Braden River will take you to our doorstep, the Linger Lodge. The boat ride is smooth and should take about two hours to complete. If this is something right up your alley, contact us for inquiries about our boating adventures. Dining Experience If you enjoy a fun meal under Bradenton's thick, untamed trees, then the Linger Lodge Restaurant and Clubhouse is a good place to start. The restaurant offers a spectacular experience for outdoor enthusiasts. With a charming view of the wild landscape, you enjoy some of Sarasota and Bradenton's signature dishes. We have many dishes, including seafood, frog legs, and smoked meat, all prepared for your ideal dining experience. If you feel audacious, you should try our perfectly grilled alligator meat. Get to enjoy a romantic summer night outside as you take advantage of all our menu servings made just for you. Kayaking Kayaking is a popular sport in Florida. It also offers a different opportunity to explore the Braden River if you are not into boat rides. Some areas along the river might be impossible to walk through, and the kayak is an ideal solution to the problem. Many tourists find it easier to visit the Linger Lodge Restaurant while having a kayak adventure. The long river stretch offers a perfect opportunity to get paddling exercise while watching some of the most scenic vegetation along the river. Furthermore, the river has little current, making it easy to maneuver your way around the thick mangrove tunnels of the river stretch. Wildlife and Bird Watching The Braden River is a hot spot for wildlife and birds. It is a popular site for wildlife lovers, bird watchers, and photographers. You will enjoy the quiet ambiance of nature while seeing some of the river's iconic mangrove tunnels and birds singing through the trees. You might also see a few turtles on your way to the lodge if you are fortunate. RV Camping A camping experience is always a nice way to enjoy your trip around the Braden River. And if you are planning a long family vacation, bring your RV. The Linger Lodge RV Park is a one-stop camping site for RV campers. The site has a shaded parking space for your mobile home and adequate security for the ultimate camping experience. The calm and serene surroundings make it ideal for any family camping activity without the worry of renting rooms. Furthermore, the site also offers state-of-the-art facilities and amenities for a better camping experience. The Linger Lodge bathhouse has individual restrooms, showers, and changing and laundry facilities, all for your convenience.

Ride safe and have a blast at Idaho Dunes RV! Meet the Team Mike McGroarty Owner Mike McGroarty has been an off-road, aviation, and outdoor enthusiast his entire life.  At the age of 15, Mike earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America and by that time had over 300 nights of wilderness camping experience.  His love for the outdoors turned into a passion for off-roading as soon as his first job earned him enough income to purchase his first sport ATV.  This first ATV started an addiction for rock crawling, trail riding and sand duning that still occupies 100% of Mike’s interest to this day. Garrett McGroarty Manager Garrett McGroarty was born into the “Idaho Dunes Way of Life”.  At 3 years old, Garrett started his off-road passion on a Kawasaki KFX 50.  Garrett has logged more trail miles between Idaho Dunes RV and West Yellowstone than anyone in the area.  At a young age, Garrett developed a passion for helicopters and aviation.  Before graduating from high school, Garrett earned both his private helicopter license (PPL-H) and commercial helicopter license (CPL-H).  With advanced pilot training from the best instructors in the industry at Helisafe in Southern California, Garrett has mastered the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopters flight systems and emergency procedures.  If you have questions about the campground, dunes, local area, trail rides, or helicopter tours Garrett is your best bet to get the answers you are looking for.

Network Management. Spectrum uses a variety of reasonable network management tools and practices consistent with industry standards. In the event the periods of congestion necessitate such management, Spectrum has available the following tools and practices (without limitation and as may be adjusted over time): (i) Subscriber Traffic Management (STM) technology to temporarily lower the priority of traffic with the greatest impact on peak congestion; (ii) spam filtering and detection techniques; and (iii) measures to protect the security and integrity of its network, resources and subscribers (e.g., IP reputation services from multiple sources to deny mail relay to suspect IPs of Charter IP space, real-time IP block lists to determine whether to accept a connection to inbound mail servers, port security techniques such as encryption and authentication, and email server- to-server traffic monitoring). In limited instances if employed, these techniques may affect the throughput rate at which subscribers may send and receive data, the ability of users to establish session connections within the network, or result in the delay of certain traffic during times of peak congestion.

The Linger Lodge Restaurant is housed in a cottage building with a screened porch that offers beautiful views of the Braden River. It’s accessible by car, bike, or boat and they have a courtesy dock for those arriving from the river. Inside the cottage, you will find a main dining area, a bar area, and the screened porch. The main dining area (and almost every other part of the building) is adorned with a huge collection of preserved local wildlife including elks, snakes, armadillos, and more. This was the contribution of the lodge’s second owner, Dr. Frank Gamsky, who was a veterinarian from Milwaukee and practiced taxidermy. The bar area also has quite a unique collection of vintage beer cans displayed on the back wall. When the weather is nice, I recommend dining out on the screened porch that overlooks the river. Not only does it offer the perfect atmosphere, but there’s also a good chance you’ll get to enjoy some live music while you’re there. Seafood Bloody Mary Live Music on the Screened Porch View of the Braden River The menu is mostly southern grub and includes a few uncommon menu items such as Fresh Frog Legs and Alligator Bites . Don’t forget to order their colossal Seafood Bloody Mary if you’re there for brunch. They will ask you if that’s your meal or a drink – it’s that big. The one we tried came out with three skewers, one with gator, chicken, and catfish. The second is grilled shrimp, and the third has fried vegetables. Some other popular appetizers include the Fried Green Tomatoes and Hush Puppies . I suggest getting the River Sampler Platter if you want to try a bit of everything, but if you want to do this, you must arrive hungry. Frog’s Legs Seafood Scampi Baby Back Ribs There are a few selections for salads and soups. Both the Linger Lodge Gumbo and the Alligator Chowder are served by the cup or bowl. Among the sandwiches and burgers, you will find a Gator Burger with a 100% wild alligator patty and roasted red pepper sauce; the Linger Burger which is a half pound of their special blend of ground brisket and short rib; and the Catfish Reuben which is fresh Louisiana catfish with sauerkraut, melted Swiss cheese and Thousand Island dressing. Entrées like Florida Gator , Louisiana Catfish , New England Crab Cakes, and N.C Cheshire Pork Baby Back Ribs are served with two sides. On the dessert list, you can choose from the River Bottom Pie , Florida Key Lime Pie, or Peanut Butter Pie . The River Bottom Pie is their signature dessert and consists of coffee ice cream topped with Oreo crumbles, fudge sauce, and chopped walnuts. The restaurant is very busy with good reason! I recommend making a reservation if you can. Large groups gather there and the dining rooms fill up quickly. The restaurant is open Wednesday through Sunday from 11:30 am – 9:00 pm and is closed Mondays and Tuesdays. You can reserve a table via email restaurant@lingerlodge.com or by calling 941-755-2757 . History of the Campsite The Linger Lodge is a newly renovated RV park with all the modern facilities for utilities and 77 years of history. The property consisted of over 100 acres when it was first recorded in 1945 by the Parvin family. At that time, the park included amenities like fishing, canoeing, and camping. The cabin served as a lodge and served food on the ground floor (see historic pictures below). The second owners, Dr. Frank and Elaine Gamsky, purchased the property in 1968. It was not until 2016 that the Hartl Family from Austria fell in love with the park and purchased it. Their commitment since that day has been to preserve and enhance the Old Florida character of this site. Today’s RV park offers many of the same amenities as the original campgrounds plus an indoor pool, a clubhouse, laundry facilities, and RV pads. The Linger Lodge is located at 7116 85th Street Court East Bradenton, FL 34202. Check out their menu and be sure to follow them on Facebook so you can keep up with all the specials, live music schedule, and more! About the Author Jean Totti has spent a lifetime traveling and eating to satisfy his curiosity and learn about food. After many years of an Ivy League career in Architecture, he went back to school in 2014 and completed another master’s degree, this time in Journalism and Food Writing at USF. That also led him to open his own restaurant which he ran for a number of years until he retired. Today he takes his writing and passion for food to several publications around the Tampa Bay Area and North Carolina. Did you enjoy this article? Share it on your favorite social media platform!
