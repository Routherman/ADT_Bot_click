West Coast Harley Davidson are based in Hillington Park and service the whole of Scotland providing all things Harley Davidson, from new and used bikes to clothing and even an onsite café. From their online store westcoastharley.com you can view the full range of bikes and accessories on offer. Name: West Coast Harley Davidson Sector: Retail Client since: 2019 The Challenge West Coast Harley have consistently outsourced their IT Support to a managed service provider. As a business that is constantly busy and heavily dependent on its IT infrastructure, they decided to review their IT Services provision due to some ongoing issues they were experiencing. They wanted to ensure that going forward their network would function in a reliable and secure way. At the same time, they also wanted to modernise their systems in order to stay ahead of the curve with technology and find reliable solutions that would allow their employees to quickly and efficiently collaborate with each other. How We Helped Certum were chosen due to our talented technical team, proven through our multiple Microsoft Gold Partner accreditations, references and the fact we were the only provider to demonstrate an ISO 27001 security certification. We quickly implemented their Flexible Managed IT Support Service, ensuring that West Coast Harley had access to our Glasgow based team, comprising of a Service Desk with monitoring, reporting, Microsoft qualified Systems Administrators, project services, procurement services, and an experienced technical account manager. With the existing on-premise servers approaching their natural end of life and the business growth meaning that its IT requirements were becoming increasingly complex we advised moving to Microsoft Office 365 in order to fulfil the requirements for enhanced collaboration, security and data storage. “Certum have been instrumental in bringing West Coast’s IT up to date so we can offer our customers the best possible service. They have given us confidence with their proactive approach ensuring problems are dealt with quickly and efficiently, sometimes even before we know about them. From initial contact with Brian to on boarding and migration with Gavin and the guys on the service desk nothing has been too much trouble.” – Lesley Breen, Operations manager The Results Certum’s Managed IT Support Service resulted in increased confidence for the team now that it has access to Certum’s entire technical expertise should it be required and that any future issues would be dealt with quickly and professionally, allowing them to concentrate on their core business goals. Office 365 has proven popular with staff, they are now utilising Teams, OneDrive and SharePoint and making the most of their 100GB mailboxes for closer communication and collaboration between teams. Their link up with Azure AD means they get the benefits of increased security and reporting. Moving forward they are well placed to take advantage of the scalability, services and resilient security that Microsoft’s cloud platform provides. Is it worth 5 minutes of your time?
