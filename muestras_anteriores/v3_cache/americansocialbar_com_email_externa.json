To that end, we have taken steps to maximize the accessibility of our website to work with industry-standard screen reading software. We have also upgraded the site to include contrast and font adjustments to make each page more easily navigable for our visually impaired guests. We completely understand that not everyone is similarly suited; there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will guarantee a flawless user experience for everyone or the computer hardware/software used to access this website. American Social, therefore, believes that communication with its guests is of paramount importance to enable us to appropriately respond to each guest’s unique circumstances.

Please rest assured that American Social is ready, willing, and able to offer auxiliary aids and services to all of our guests for the purpose of allowing them full and equal access to our website. For example, upon request we will have any portion of our website read aloud to our guests by a qualified reader to the extent such guests are otherwise unable to access the website. Our staff is also happy to assist guests with making reservations to the extent such guests encounter difficulty in scheduling a reservation through our website. Please use the “CONTACT” link at the top of this page to advise American Social of any accessibility barriers encountered by our guests.
