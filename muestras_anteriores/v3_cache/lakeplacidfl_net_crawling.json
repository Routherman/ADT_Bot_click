Other improvements would include upgraded bleachers at the ballfields and restrooms for the park. COURTESY/TOURIST DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL-VISIT SEBRING Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The Town of Lake Placid wants help from Visit Florida to improve Lake June Park. Recently, Town Administrator Charlette Rodriguez and Town Engineer Dennis Murray spoke to the Tourist Development Council Board of Directors, asking for their support to get a sport facility improvement grant. They want to upgrade the parking, boat ramps and amenities at Lake June Park to make it more feasible for big events. According to the application, the reimbursable grant would refund the town up to 75% of the maximum funding of $30,000, once work has been completed. The list of events already taking place at Lake June Park includes the Lake June Boat races, accounting for more than 200 room-nights for that weekend and up to 1,300 spectators and 20 food and merchandise vendors. Murray told the TDC Board how the park has approximately 15 acres of space to build. It currently has parking, picnic tables, ball fields, soccer fields, a boat ramp and dock, restrooms, playground equipment and a large grassy area. However, as Rodriguez and Murray pointed out, the town needs to have a study done for a master plan to enhance the facility and make Lake Placid more of a sports tourism destination. Right now, parking only consists of grass and shell surface with no lined spaces. Town officials want to see paved parking and a larger boat dock. They also want to see overhead lighting, improved restrooms and at least eight pickleball courts. Debra Worley, representative on the Board for Lake Placid, said the last master plan for this park dates back to 2006, almost 20 years ago. Town staff, she said, have been working on upgrades to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. With some orange groves being sold off around the park, she said this is a chance to expand it. “It’s time to do it,” Worley said. “Different sports have come into play. We haven’t had a plan in a long time. We need professional advice.” In the grant application, town staff stated that a master plan would provide clear vision and a structured approach to improvements, as well as a means to foster and increase community involvement in the process and the park itself. The plan could help them better allocate funds and resources for improvements, the grant application states, and would provide a long-term plan to sustain growth and improvements at the site. Recently, the town hosted the Southern Outlaw Drag Boat Association, from Sept. 7-8, 2024. It brought in more than 100 visitors and overnight guests, the grant application states. Plans in place now would bring the race back this year (2025) and in 2026. Other plans will bring a paddleboard endurance race to Lake June in December 2025. Right now, Lake June Park can park 100 trailers and vehicles for 40-foot-long boats on a temporary basis, on the grass. The drag boat event also needs a 10,000-square-foot staging area for vendors and food trucks, the grant application states. Right now, the park has just one boat launch, no overhead lights and no hookups on site for power. Improving the boat launch area would be the first phase, with an additional launch ramp and a larger dock, approximately 5,000 square feet, as well as lighting and restroom expansion. The second phase would involve reconditioning the ball fields, further lighting improvements and improving the concession stand and bleachers, as outlined in the application.

The Loop is a premium vacation destination for recreation, not just in Summer and Winter, but all year long. Offering four distinct seasons, most visitors to June Lake are outdoor enthusiasts seeking activities in the Great Outdoors. Winter recreation in The Loop includes downhill skiing and snowboarding on June Mountain, also known as “California’s Family Mountain” where kids as young as 12-years and under can ski or snowboard for FREE! There is also cross country skiing and snowmobile groomed trails available nearby. In the warmer months, the snow-capped mountains melt away, transforming our lakes and valleys into a summer playground for recreation enthusiasts who enjoy camping, RVing, hiking, biking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing and boating. The Loop, with its four pristine alpine lakes is a fishermen’s paradise! Fishing season opener, known as Fishmas happens on the last Saturday in April. There are four Marinas in the Loop with boat rentals and launches. There are six trailheads in the Loop with varying distances and levels of difficulty so there is something for everyone.
