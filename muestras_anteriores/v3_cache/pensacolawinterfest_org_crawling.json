LOUIS, MO TWIN CITIES, MN FAQ APPLAUSE PARTNERSHIPS EMAIL LISTS COMING SOON CONTACT US About Spreading cheer is our favorite holiday tradition Founded in 2014, Holiday Lights Trolley LLC is the original producer of the BYOB Holiday Lights Trolley Tours. Our founder, Molly Shaheen has always had a love and passion for the holidays, especially the many iconic holiday lights displays. As a seasoned event planner, she hoped to introduce a new experience that would spread holiday cheer with others in a unique way. She realized the holidays, lights, and festive drinks were the perfect combination for an unforgettable evening in Chicago. The BYOB Holiday Lights Trolley Tours were born. Over the years, she has tweaked and refined the tours across the midwest, adding stops, bars, and various partnerships to offer the best experiences for our guests and make their seasons bright. But, what Molly was most excited about was the opportunity to give back to local charities during the Season of Giving. Each year, city managers select a local charity to donate a portion of the trolley tour proceeds to. It’s a small way to pay it forward during the holiday season. Now in our eleventh year of service, our public trolley tours will be available for the 2025 season in nine different cities: Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Grand Rapids,  Kansas City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh & St. Louis for guests 21 and older. We also offer private tours in all cities (some of which allow little ones to join with certain restrictions). What are you waiting for? Gather your \"deerest\" friends and family and eat, drink, and be merry with us this holiday season. Contact us TOUR LOCATIONS FAQs Contact Parnterships Powered by Squarespace"

With boundless enthusiasm and unwavering professionalism, we take immense joy in unveiling the breathtaking beauty of our state and imparting our insider insights as proud locals. But our commitment doesn’t end there. We are deeply dedicated to uplifting our community, tirelessly championing all things Alaska throughout our tours and interactions. From musicians to doctors, the Anchorage Trolley Family embraces a rich tapestry of aspiring young adults, university scholars, and local Alaskans. Here, teamwork isn’t just a concept – it’s our way of life. Even as our family members venture forth, they remain cherished parts of our close-knit community, and we couldn’t be prouder to have played a role in their journeys. Contact Us ANCHORAGE TROLLEY TOURS When Fred Rodgers created Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood, he probably had no idea that his dream would inspire a tour company that has helped thousands see the beauty that Anchorage has to offer. Nor did Cyrus Aldeman, as a child of only 4, realize that watching it would shape his family and future, but it did! Anchorage Trolley was born from a child’s fascination with every child’s favorite show and a father hoping to provide for his family. After some time operating tours solely in the family minivan, Anchorage Trolley experienced its’ origin when Cyrus Aldeman , four years old at the time, became inspired by the famous TV show, Mr. Rogers. Enamored with a certain unique vehicle featured on Mr. Rogers, Cyrus ran over to Caleb Aldeman, his father, to show him the vehicle that would soon become their future. It was a trolley! Caleb instantly fell in love with the Trolley, calling out to his wife, “Hey Barb, what do you think if we offer our tours in a trolley instead of a van?” She replied, “Cute idea, Caleb, but how will we pay for this trolley? I’m sure they are expensive.” Caleb tentatively responded, ”…a loan?” She replied, “Absolutely not. We will not go into debt; we’re selling your airplane.” The rest, is history. On May 4th, 1995, Anchorage Trolley began- first operating out of the historical 4th Avenue Theater, and then home in the Log Cabin Visitor Center on the corner 4th and F St. For 25 years, we have been showing visitors from all over the world why Anchorage is the most beloved city in Alaska and the highlight of our state. From history to local stories, we are proud to show visitors the highlights of life in the biggest city in Alaska. Cyrus Aldeman has been Anchorage Trolley’s acting CEO (Chief Experience Officer) for the past 17 years. To date, we have five trolleys, all named after friends and family members who have had great significance to each trolley. With the help of the McCarrey family, we have amassed a team of amazing storytellers, with a burning passion for sharing our city’s past, present, and all the many reasons why we love to share Anchorage with all of our guests. Anchorage Trolley Tours is a family-owned and operated company with a strong sense of community. In the last 25 years, we have employed dozens of fellow Alaskans as they worked their way through college, created a high school scholarship benefitting dozens of Alaskan students, and countless sponsorships in the community. We love our business and stand by our motto, “It’s not just a tour, it’s an experience!” ADDRESS 546 West 4th Avenue\nAnchorage, AK 99516 PHONE +1 (907) 276 - 5603 EMAIL Book@AnchorageTrolley.com CONTACT US +1 907 276 5603 book@anchoragetrolley.com PICK UP ADDRESS: 546 W. 4TH AVENUE ANCHORAGE, AK 99501 QUICK LINKS HOME TOURS BLOG CONTACT US FAQ'S RESOURCES TRAVEL AND TRADE MEDIA KIT FAQ'S ABOUT US OUR BROCHURE ©1995-2023 Anchorage Trolley Tours Cancellation Policy Instagram Facebook Twitter Tiktok Youtube Pinterest Tripadvisor Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy CONTACT US +1 907 276 5603 book@anchoragetrolley.com PICK UP ADDRESS: 546 W. 4TH AVENUE ANCHORAGE, AK 99501 QUICK LINKS HOME TOURS BLOG CONTACT US FAQ'S RESOURCES TRAVEL AND TRADE MEDIA KIT FAQ'S ABOUT US OUR BROCHURE Privacy Policy Cancellation Policy Terms & Conditions ©1995-2023 Anchorage Trolley Tours Instagram Facebook Twitter Tiktok Youtube Pinterest Tripadvisor"
