Check-in was a breeze, our room was so much more than expected; finding out beach towels, chairs and umbrellas on the beach, as well as paddle boards, bicycles, and kayaks were all included was an added bonus.” “We were so impressed with the amenities, the staff, the food, the grounds, the cleanliness, and the activities that were available! We truly enjoyed our stay & will return again in the near future!!!!” “We enjoyed every minute of our visit to Sundial Beach Resort & Spa. The staff was incredible and the service was amazing.” “All the amenities allowed for a super relaxing week with young children. The room was fully equipped with everything that we needed to conduct our lives just as we do at home. Complimentary bike rentals, beach and pool toys, towels, etc. made it so simple… Will definitely be back” “What an excellent place to stay! This wasn’t the first time we stayed there nor will it be the last! The customer service is over the top!” “Best beach vaca on the island! Great pool bar. Excellent food. Terrific staff. Lots to do. Beach. Bikes. Kayak. Paddle Board. Shell. Swim. Good times with friends, family or as a couple. Can’t wait to come back!” “We greatly enjoyed our Sundial vacation. We stayed in a lovely, spotlessly-clean oceanfront condo, and the waves lulled us to sleep each night. The team Sundial has assembled tops even the view. From the reservation desk to housekeeping to the wait staff to the activity desk, all went above and beyond to provide world-class customer service.” “My family and I have been enjoying the Sundial for almost 20 years. Our first stay was in 1998! It is our home away from home for a few days every year and we really don’t want to leave. It is very family-friendly, has excellent proximity to the beach, lots of pools and there are many amenities to choose from. So relaxing! We are already looking to our next visit!” “A wonderful place to rest, relax, rejuvenate and re-connect with yourself and your family. The natural setting is so peaceful. The staff were great, activities plentiful and the location was perfect. We will definitely be back! Thanks.” “The location and service are amazing. Basically they provide everything you need for a relaxing and most enjoyable vacation! The pools are beautiful, the beach pristine and the staff is very helpful. The restaurants are conveniently located and the food is top-notch.” “This place was better than anything I expected. It was very clean, the staff was nice and friendly. It was located right on the beach and was close to all the major shopping and activities located on Sanibel Island. I highly recommend it.” “We had a wonderful weekend stay at Sundial Beach Resort. The service, room, resort facilities were top-notch and, of course, the beach-front is superb. The food at both the cocktail reception on Friday and wedding dinner on Saturday was delicious. Of course, the wonderful sunset for the wedding was spectacular.” “Loved this place because of the great location and amenities they have to offer. You get great service and lots of things to do while staying there. All in our family had a great time, the rooms were super clean, the pool was great and the staff was very friendly! Will recommend to all my friends and will come back again!” Join The Club!

We spoke with Avery about her and Eddie’s big day and the special touches that made the day perfect. All photos by @taylornicollephoto How did you meet? Eddie and I met while I was doing an internship in Hawaii! He was stationed there with the Army, and it was the summer before my senior year of college. After I graduated, I moved out to be with him in Hawaii, and eventually, Florida, which is where we were engaged in July of 2020! How did he propose? I always tease Eddie about not being able to plan anything, but for this, he was able to sneak my best friends and family all to Destin to propose to me on a Friday evening after work. He forced me to get ready for a date night and dragged me over to the beach by our house for a glass of wine before we went to dinner. I even jokingly patted him down saying, “you better not be proposing!” When we got there, there was a photographer blatantly perched up next to us (ironically, he was there on unrelated business) but I laughed and thought, “if he were proposing, there’s no way it would be this blatant. He said some very sweet words and then got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. After I enthusiastically said, “YES!”  he told me to turn around, and all of my favorite people were there waiting on me! We celebrated all weekend, and it was a blast! I couldn’t believe he pulled that off without me having any idea… I am VERY nosy! What were some of your favorite details about your wedding? I loved all of the amazing Sundial food and staff; it truly went off without a hitch! We had an appetizer bar for our rehearsal, a late-night snack bar added to the reception after our dinner, and a breakfast buffet for the next morning. All weekend, my guests raved about the food! I also loved my pampas grass backdrops made by Something Bloomed and the amazing groomsmen cake! Lady Cakes executed my design perfectly and was so up for the challenge! Not to mention, their cakes are delish! What were some memorable moments from your wedding day? Some of the most memorable moments were the surprises my mom and friends worked on for me, coupled with the laughs I shared with my new husband and guests at the reception. Getting those intimate moments with the ones you love, is so important. It really does make the whole day. Some of my favorites were getting to see my photographer, Taylor, a friend from college, laughing about hauling my dress through the sand, my first look with my brother, and dinner with my honey! Would you recommend Sundial Resort to other couples? Why? OF COURSE! Sundial is not only in a beautiful setting with delicious food, but is staffed by some of the nicest, most professional people I’ve met. Tracy was my coordinator and was so hands-on and detail-oriented it was almost scary. She knew what was going on better than I did. All our guests were able to stay on-site and were able to enjoy their free time on the property. Everyone loved it just as much as I did, and it was the best weekend ever! What advice would you give to future bride and grooms? I would say, lay out a timeline and keep a planner. That way you stay on track. Also, knock out your big stuff first! Then you can start to relax more. Don’t wait until the last few months or weeks to get your projects done. Next would be to keep it realistic. No one cares about a guest favor (especially for a destination wedding). Save your money there and put it towards something more important. Also, leave time to enjoy yourself! Whether that manifests itself as time off before the wedding, during that weekend, or after, don’t forget about what YOU want! Your wedding is your day, have fun!

Find out more about their love story and the process of planning a wedding at Sundial. How did you meet? We met at a mutual friend’s Ugly Christmas Sweater Party. Ed already knew he wanted to meet me because he looked at the guest list on the Facebook invite prior to the party. He reached out to me the day after the party and the rest is history. How did he propose? Ed proposed on Christmas Eve of last year. He waited until we got home from our family gatherings. We continued the fun and had our two-man party, as we call it, and he got down on one knee, gave a little speech and popped the question. I could not even tell you what he said, I was so in shock! What were some of your favorite details about the wedding? Only everything! Honestly, I was blown away by how everything came together. The resort itself is gorgeous with tons of amenities. The food was delicious. The customer service was all around outstanding. All my vendors greatly surpassed my expectations. My florals were stunning. Just everything! Why did you choose Sundial as your wedding venue? I chose Sundial as my wedding venue because I knew I wanted to get married in Southern Florida on the beach. After doing a lot of research, I narrowed it down to Sanibel Island because I’ve heard great things and it’s very conveniently located near Fort Myers airport. From there I searched venues in Sanibel and Sundial was a clear choice. Would you recommend Sundial Resort to other couples? If so, why? Yes! If you haven’t already figured out by now, I’m so thankful we chose Sundial! Aside from the fact that this resort has anything you could ever want for a wedding getaway, the people who work there are truly amazing. Planning my wedding was honestly a stress-free process because of how great the event coordinators are. Also, every single staff member that we met during our wedding weekend was incredibly accommodating and kind. That’s a bold statement but it’s true. What advice would you give to future brides and grooms? Stay true to what you want for your wedding day. Don’t let other people’s opinions influence your wedding planning. It’s impossible to please everyone and, as long as you stay true to what you and your future spouse imagined for your special day, you will have no regrets. Looking to plan your own wedding?

As you know, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Southwest Florida and caused devastating damage to Sanibel Island and the surrounding areas. The island was not accessible for a period of time as the focus was on rescue and recovery missions; in addition, the causeway was damaged in several areas making it impassable. Amazingly, a temporary causeway was up and running by day 15! Inspections and clean-up are underway at the resort and we hope to have a repair timeline soon. (We have canceled reservations until we can announce a reopening date.) Our mission is to rebuild and come back as the best version of Sundial that we can be! Sincerely, Becky Miller Sundial Beach Resort & Spa General Manager HURRICANE DAMAGE The resort received varying degrees of damage. Turtle’s Tiki Bar was a victim of the surge and was washed away. The Fitness Center, Turtle Scouts and Slice of Paradice were also casualties of the flooding, as were the marketplace and office annex. Our lobby level experienced some damage while the third floor sustained minimal damage. The accommodations on the east and west sides sustained damage ranging from minimal to substantial. The tennis and pickleball courts were damaged although most of the new pickleball fencing remained intact. And, for all the kids asking: Yes! The pool slide is still standing! AROUND THE ISLAND A temporary causeway structure makes the island accessible during certain hours, however, entry is limited to residents, business owners, emergency teams, and select others with permits. No one can drive to the island without a special city-issued permit and enforcement is stringent. Please note that the island is NOT open to the public at this time and there is a curfew in place. The Sanibel Lighthouse and its outbuildings were heavily hit by the storm. The historic outbuildings were washed away but the lighthouse remained standing as a beacon of hope. A few weeks following the storm, the lighthouse’s missing leg was recovered, and teams are working on a plan to repair the structure. Damage to island homes, businesses, and attractions was wide-spread and varied based on location and structure type. OUR SUNDIAL TEAM MEMBERS While we work to rebuild, Sundial’s management company has been diligently searching to find opportunities for our displaced workers at our sister properties including DeRomo’s Gourmet Market and Restaurant in Bonita Springs, World Equestrian Center in Ocala, and other locations from Arizona to Ohio. Pictured above are some familiar faces you may recognize, now at DeRomo’s. A core team of dedicated employees has been working to assess, clean up and clear debris from the resort; they are our unsung heroes. Several others are working remotely from our reservations center.  We look forward to the time when we can reunite and welcome our team back home to Sundial. We will continue to post updates and photos on social media as they are available. Follow @sundialresort on Facebook and Instagram to see our progress.

It’s been a joy watching the teams working to protect the nests and monitor hatchings. As a part of the Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation Adopt A Beach Program , we promise to make our beach sea turtle and sea life-friendly and, in return, enjoy an annual report of all of the documented nesting activity and rare bird sighting on our beaches. In honor of this landmark season, we wanted to share more turtle insight with all of you. Kelly Sloan of the SCCF was kind enough to be our turtle guide. What types of sea turtles nest on Sanibel? Loggerheads are the most common and we have been seeing increasing numbers of Green Turtles in recent years. However, very rarely, we will see a Kemp’s Ridley or Leatherback nest. How long does it take a mother turtle to make and lay her nest? Is it true that turtles return to where they were born to lay their nests, year after year? It takes a loggerhead hatchling around 25-30 years to reach maturity. They use the Earth’s magnetic field to return to the same general region where they were born to nest. Interestingly, an individual female doesn’t typically nest in two consecutive years – she takes a year or two off in between nesting seasons. Do nests always hatch at night? Why? Yes. Nests typically hatch at night when it’s not as easy to get dehydrated from the hot sun and there are fewer predators. This is an evolutionary trick that gives the hatchlings the best chance at survival. What % of hatchlings make it to maturity? Sea turtles face a lot of threats and only about 1 in 1,000, 0.1%, make it to adulthood. What obstacles do hatchlings have to overcome? One of the biggest threats to hatchlings in Florida is artificial lighting. When hatchlings emerge from the sand, they naturally crawl towards the brightest point on the horizon, which has historically been the reflection of the moon and stars off the sea. With coastal development, there has been an increase in artificial lights, which can cause hatchlings to go landward and become dehydrated, taken by predators, or even attempt to cross busy roads. Even headed in the right direction, hatchlings run the risk of falling into holes or getting trapped in garbage left on the beach. Every beachgoer can help by filling in holes at the end of the day, removing furniture and trash at night, and turning the lights out after dark! After they hatch and get into the sea, what do they do? These were once referred to as the “lost years” because so little was known about what they do when the hatchlings reach the open ocean. However, researchers have discovered a way to track these little turtles and learn more about their behavior. The basic picture is this: Loggerhead hatchlings head out to sea to avoid fish, sharks, and other predators. Once off the continental shelf, they eventually end up in a current, called the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. As they mature, their focus becomes on feeding and they’ll eat a variety of prey, such as mollusks and crustaceans, hydrozoans, sargassum ( sea weed), jellyfish and fish eggs. Why is protecting nests so important? How does SCCF help to assure nests are protected? Can individuals adopt a stretch of beach and how can they do that? Sea turtles are some of the most charismatic species on the planet and their population is considered vulnerable. Healthy oceans need sea turtles. Sea turtles are a “keystone species”, which means they are an important part of their environment and influence other species around them. SCCF monitors the beaches of Sanibel and Captiva every morning during sea turtle season to look for new nesting activity. Our team of volunteers mark the nests and cover the eggs with screens to prevent depredation. We have several research projects aimed at learning more about the turtles on our beaches so we can better protect them. We share the beach with sea turtles and every single person can make a difference by turning off the lights, filling in holes at the end of the day, and removing any furniture and trash from the beach. We also offer an Adopt A Beach program that allows people to become actively involved in sea turtle and shorebird conservation. Learn more today!

Beyond the beach, pool, daily children’s activities and wide variety of amenities, it’s the Sundial Team that keeps families returning time after time. Some members of the Sundial Team were once guests themselves, like Marina and Mary Beth. Marina Bloetz is the Front Office Manager that everyone is always raving about. She grew up in Munich, Germany but spent many a family vacation on our little island of Sanibel! Following her luxury hotel training with Hilton in Munich, she returned to Sundial in 2009 as a member of the staff and has risen to her current position, taking on the important task of making every Sundial guest feel warmly welcomed. Just like Marina, Mary Beth made that childhood fantasy a reality by creating a life in the place that had played host to so many family vacations and wonderful memories. As the Catering Sales Manager, it is up to Mary Beth to not just assist brides and hosts in organizing their events but to help them make lasting memories. I believe that having their own fond memories of time spent with family and friends at Sundial provides Mary Beth and Marina with a unique perspective and makes them all the more relatable to every visitor and guest. Proof that I’m not the only one that thinks the staff at Sundial is top shelf can be found in online reviews. These are just some of the quotes about Sundial staff from reviews posted on Trip Advisor within just the last month: All the staff were VERY friendly and helpful. The staff is amazing and the place is great. We had a great stay; the staff was very helpful. The front desk had a very friendly staff. Staff at the front desk was EXCELLENT, always helpful and very knowledgeable about the island. Staff is friendly and on the ball …Tiki bar staff is nice and accommodating The best bartenders are Jason, Justin, and Jim. The head staff and manager are fabulous. Wonderful front desk service- very attentive. …The employees were terrific (helpful and friendly), and the rooms were very spacious…The staff was efficient and prompt as anytime we called for something (and believe me we did our share of calling) someone was at our door in moments. I would highly recommend this resort, and I am looking forward to my next visit. The kids club got a new Director this year. Her name is Carly. She was very involved. She was at every kids activity. Anything you needed, she made sure you received it and always made sure you were happy and most of all that the kids were happy. Jader and Claude also help with the kids club and they are great too. Thanks to David for making sure that the group accommodations were handled with exceptional ease. The cheerful and friendly meeting room staff was always prepared for breaks, bringing cookies fresh from the oven and a nice assortment of soda and water.

We’re certainly staying busy at Sundial Beach Resort & Spa! I’ll get into more detail about everything you can expect from Sundial in 2017 later, but first I want to take this opportunity to review some of the exciting things that happened at the resort last year: We opened Shima Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi Bar, which has already won awards for Best New Restaurant and Best Sushi on Sanibel and Captiva Islands. Due to the success of Shima, we’re now offering sushi at Sea Breeze Café. 2016 was a record turtle nesting season for our end of the island. For the fourth year in a row, Sundial was recognized by the News-Press out of Fort Myers as the best place to Staycation in Southwest Florida. Sanibel and Captiva residents and visitors also voted us Best Full-Service Resort, Best Tiki Bar, Best Tennis and Best Event Facilities. Good Morning America filmed a special National Seashell Day segment, where Ginger Zee broadcast live right from Sundial. We installed a beach cam for guests missing the Sanibel sunshine. Check it out by clicking here . We hosted our first USTA-sanctioned tennis tournament, drawing a talented crowd of players from all over. We added Ladies Night to Sea Breeze Café’s weekly lineup. From 5-7PM, ladies drink for free with any sushi or menu purchase. Rental cabanas were added to our main pool deck. Be sure to check out our Made in the Shade package – you’ll get your third night free, plus a $50 restaurant credit and a one-day cabana rental! As of last year, you’ll find a Sundial Shelling Bag in each of our guest rooms upon check-in. Our guests took home tens of thousands of souvenirs last year. Bailey’s Marketplace began offering a grocery delivery service. Now, you can pre-order groceries online or over the phone and they’ll be put away in your condo before your arrival. So far this year, we’ve added colorful new kayaks to our fleet and we began selling logoed apparel in our activities department. Our state-of-the-art pickleball courts are under construction and the area’s largest pickleball facility will open this spring at Sundial. The courts are right on the other side of Middle Gulf Drive and will offer lakefront views. We’ve got one more construction surprise that you’ll have to stay tuned for, but know that we’ve got something new coming to the lobby later this year. At Sundial, our team is continually striving to improve your guest experience. We’re thankful to you for continuing to choose us as your vacation destination. Hope to see you soon!
