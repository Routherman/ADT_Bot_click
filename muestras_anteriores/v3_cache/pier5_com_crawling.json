(Daniel Urie, PennLive) By Daniel Urie | durie@pennlive.com Pier 1 Imports is back. Well sort of. The new Pier1 will operate as an e-commerce business. Retail Ecommerce Ventures , the investment firm that acquired the rights to Pier 1′s trademark name, intellectual property, data and various ecommerce-related assets for $31 million in July relaunched Pier1.com on Thursday. Pier 1 Imports filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year and closed all of its stores including locations at the Colonial Commons shopping center in Lower Paxton Township and at the Camp Hill shopping center in Camp Hill before the Retail Ecommerce Ventures acquisition. The new owner hired about 15 of Pier 1′s buying, marketing and customer-support personnel. The new 30-person Pier 1 team is now located in Dallas, Texas. “Central to our playbook is retaining the brand’s strengths,” Tai Lopez, executive chairman and co-founder of Retail Ecommerce Ventures said in a press release. “It’s why we retained veteran buyers from Pier 1 to reengage with vendors and bring back the merchandise our customers know and love.” The relaunched online store offers holiday and seasonal items, furniture, pillows and cushions, dining and entertaining items, décor, lighting and candles, rugs, curtains, bed and bath items, and outdoor items. So far this year, Retail Ecommerce Ventures has also acquired the brand assets and ecommerce businesses of Linens 'n Things, Franklin Mint and Modell’s Sporting Goods. Last year, the investment firm purchased the brand assets and ecommerce business of Dressbarn from the Ascena Retail Group. Retail Ecommerce Ventures was founded last year by Lopez and Alex Mehr. -- Business Buzz You can follow Daniel Urie on twitter @DanielUrie2018 and you can like PennLive’s business page on Facebook at @PennLiveBusiness If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

We are honored to have the opportunity to breathe new life into Bayside Marketplace and look forward to welcoming guests soon.” Named after South Florida’s most renowned fishing pier, the history of PIER 5 dates back to the early 1900s as it played a vital role as a fish market, tourist attraction and prime location for some of the best sport fishing in the area. The area hosted Miami’s most popular sport fishing competitions and served as a breeding ground for incredible innovation and development in fishing, including the invention of kite fishing. Today, Bayside Marketplace is still a launching point for sports fishermen and provides proximity for visitors to the Port of Miami and Miami International Airport. “PIER 5 is a representation of our commitment to celebrating Miami’s energetic culture by bringing people together and creating lasting memories. As Miami locals, we’re ready to reinvigorate Bayside Marketplace with PIER 5 as a destination for all to enjoy with creative event programming, delicious drinks and food on the bayfront,” says Alex Mantecon, co-founder of Breakwater Hospitality Group. Crafted by Saladino Design Studios , the venue’s design is a nod to Miami’s fishing culture with an elevated, contemporary tropical influence. The floor pattern pays homage to a ship’s journey from coast to coast, while the main bar front mirrors vintage boats with smooth curves and brass detailing. The second bar boasts glossy deep blue elements and ribbing details, offering a modern tribute to maritime aesthetics. The venue masterfully blends nostalgia with a sense of excitement about the present and future. PIER 5 represents a modernized take on an art-deco inspired brand, seamlessly incorporating marine elements such as nautical flags spelling out “PIER.” Upon entering, visitors immediately sense the feeling of being on a ship, with meticulously crafted woodwork defining the main bar front and custom furniture.
