She loves constantly expanding her musical repertoire and promoting great independent artists. When she's not on the clock, she enjoys films (that make her uncomfortable), dancing, experimenting with flavors in the kitchen with her daughter and husband and finding hidden gems while traveling. While it may be exhausting, she never gets tired of high-speed walking around big cities.

Jared Hemming Event Manager/Volunteer Coordinator jhemming@thecedar.org READ BIO Volunteer Coordinator/ Events Assistant volunteer@thecedar.org / jhemming@thecedar.org Pronouns: He/Him Background: As a biracial kid growing up in Coon Rapids and Pequot Lakes, Minnesota, Jared has always understood music is vital. Playing percussion and drums in various school bands kept him out of trouble (surprisingly) and helped him realize our differences bond us. Desperate for diversity, he moved to Minneapolis in 2012. He dove into the Twin Cities music community immediately, attending and playing shows with glee. His first show at The Cedar was of Montreal, a perfect entry into the colorful world existing inside this old movie theater. In 2016, he joined the Cedar as a house manager, and he’s thrilled to work closer with The Cedar’s amazing volunteers as Volunteer Coordinator and Events Assistant. He previously worked as a special education teaching assistant at Saint Paul Public Schools, assisting special needs students as they learned how to produce music. He earned his BA in journalism from the University of Minnesota in 2016, and has written for City Pages, MPR News and the Minnesota Daily. When he’s not attending, working or drumming at shows, he likes to write, joke around and get tattoos. Contact Jared about: How to become a volunteer House Managers Patrick Larkin House Manager READ BIO Pronouns: He/Him Patrick joined the Cedar as an office assistant working 3 hours a day five days a week in 2011, before transitioning into a House Manager position the following year. In addition to working as a House Manger, he is currently working as an Associate Librarian in Hennepin County Libraries at a very loud and lively library. In the past, he's worked as a gas station attendant, flower waterer, personal care assistant, and a newspaper editor at the East Side Review in St. Paul. When he's not working, he endures to do home improvement, and enjoys curating music events and playing in longtime band the Miami Dolphins, or solo under the moniker P. Larkin, which is pretty much just the first initial of his first name and then his last name. He also likes to fish. Sam Ray House Manager READ BIO Mollierae miller House Manager READ BIO Pronouns: They/She MollieRae moved to Minneapolis in 2012 to study art and quickly found their unique passions for the live music to be found in the Twin Cities. While growing up they were lucky enough to be exposed to all kinds of folk music and trade craft scenes while tagging along with their folk artist parents. Having gone to school for art and returning again to study library science has accelerated MollieRae’s quest for all sorts of knowledge and creative expression. The Cedar is a space where they could find the kinds of music and dance they love as well as revisit favorite musicians they fell for years ago. Having been working in Minneapolis nonprofits for years, they carry a constant excitement to help the community become engaged with the gift of the Cedar as well as with the beauty of the Twin Cities’ arts and culture. Currently an acrylic painter and a student, MollieRae can also be found biking through the city, reading, dancing, cooking and laughing while telling long stories. Matt “doc” jones House Manager READ BIO Pronouns: He/Him Matt \"Doc\" is an eager but profoundly mediocre guitarist who moved to the Twin Cities in 1989 to continue his medical training just in time for the birth of The Cedar as a live music venue. He discovered it fortuitously en route to the Cabooze one night and since has logged 100+ nights of communal aural bliss in the venue that, in his opinion, has a sacred, loving vibe that is unmatched on this planet. Now semi-retired, he finally has time to devote to the staff side of The Cedar experience, enjoying it tremendously. In the world beyond The Cedar, Doc basks in the warm glow of tube amps while spinning all-genre vinyl for anyone who visits his audio lair. He loves his wife and children, critters Althea, Cirrus, and Sahil, hiking, biking, skiing, and travel, volunteers for local and international medical projects, and teaches high performance driving. Jacob strauss House Manager READ BIO Pronouns: He/Him Jacob started volunteering at the Cedar in 2018 shortly after moving to the area for graduate school. He joined the Cedar staff in the fall of 2020 as a house manager. When he's not working, Jacob enjoys attending shows, playing with his cat, and hanging out at Palmers. drey darst kereakos House Manager READ BIO Pronouns: They/Them Drey is a long-time music player, writer, and enjoyer, as well as soon-to-be Augsburg University grad through the Music Business program (Spring 2022). After graduating from the music department at Perpich Center for Arts Education in 2017, and into their start at Augsburg the following Fall, Drey began performing and releasing music independently under the name \"drey dk\", where they write, record, produce, mix/master their work as well. Their first globally distributed single \"Pity Party\" was released in early September of 2019. As a Seward resident of many years, they recently joined the House Manager team at the Cedar in December 2021, and hope to build on and expand their knowledge within multiple facets of the Music Industry outside of performing. You may also spot them working over at Jack's Hardware and Farm Supply, and occasionally as a Camp counselor/music instructor for local non-profit She Rock She Rock over the summer. As much as Drey loves going to shows for fun, when not working, they likely are just eating copious amounts of pizza, shopping for vinyl, or snuggling with their cats. PAUL MCCOYER House Manager EMILY LAZEAR House Manager READ BIO Pronouns: She/Her Emily grew up in the Twin Cities and credits The Cedar for inspiring her to be a multi-instrumentalist, singer, and artist. She shadowed a Cedar employee for her 9th grade career day and is thrilled to be now working toward the Cedar’s mission of supporting local and international musicians and encouraging intercultural understanding through music.
