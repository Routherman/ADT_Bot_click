In 1989, the Florida Communities Trust was created to meet this need. The Trust was funded through the Preservation 2000 bond program until the Florida Forever program was approved by the Florida Legislature in 1999. The Parks and Open Space Florida Forever grant program provides funding to local governments and eligible nonprofit environmental organizations for acquisition of community-based parks, open space and greenways that further outdoor recreation and natural resource protection needs identified in local government comprehensive plans. The program provides local governments the opportunity to leverage local dollars with state dollars to optimize conservation benefits and encourages both public-private partnerships and land acquisition initiatives. The Parks and Open Space Florida Forever Grant Program requires local governments to provide a minimum 25% match, except for nonprofit environmental organizations and small local governments (defined as municipalities with a population less than 10,000 and counties with a population less than 75,000).

The land management activities prompting the trail closure have been completed. All Alachua County Preserves with public access are now open for public use. The nearly 6,000-acre Barr Hammock Preserve is actively managed through the Alachua County Forever Program, the voter-approved initiative to acquire, improve and manage environmentally sensitive lands to protect water resources, wildlife habitat, and natural areas suitable for resource-based recreation. The referendum was first passed in November 2000. It was funded again by the voters in 2008, 2016, and 2022 with the Wild Spaces and Public Places Referendum.

Photo by Seth Johnson From the Santa Fe River in the top spot to the Buda Sandhills and Beech Valley at the bottom, Alachua County’s strategic ecosystems protect paths for deer and bobcats, conserve nesting areas for herons and provide direct access to the Florida aquifer. Alachua County set apart 47 strategic ecosystems in 2006, providing extra screening for development on 165,000 acres that constitute 26% of the entire county. Identified in the KNB/ Golder Associates report, the ecosystems vary in size and character. The smallest, the 27-acre Buzzard’s Roost, lies close to Newberry Road near The Rock of Gainesville. The largest, Northeast Flatwoods, swallows 18,292 acres near Waldo. Become A Member Mainstreet does not have a paywall, but pavement-pounding journalism is not free. Join your neighbors who make this vital work possible. See Member Benefits Graphic by Camille Broadway Alachua’s strategic ecosystems The KBN report focused on private property. State and county preserves, like Paynes Prairie, were set aside from the strategic ecosystems since they already had protections in place. “These were sites that weren’t currently protected under public ownership,” said Stephen Hofstetter said. “The concept was to identify, locate, and describe these areas that are the most significant natural, biological communities both upland and wetland.” Hofstetter helped craft Alachua County’s 2006 Comprehensive Plan that first included the strategic ecosystems. He now serves as director of the county’s Environmental Protection Department. “There was a lot of concern, I think, for some property owners in the beginning,” Hofstetter said. Since their creation, the strategic ecosystem designation has changed nothing on the ground for most property owners. Hofstetter said some have even developed properties that touch or include portions of the 47 ecosystems through the county’s regular process without any extra hoops. “It’s a new concept; they weren’t sure how it was going to work. I think over time, we’ve adjusted and understood that it really isn’t that much different than our rural agriculture policies for anyone,” Hofstetter said. Development within strategic ecosystems Hofstetter said that property within strategic ecosystems can still be developed. The county even gives density bonuses identical to the rural agriculture bonus. Photo by Seth Johnson Alligator warning sign at Barr Hammock Preserve. But if a development will impact a significant part of the listed ecosystem, the owner needs to complete a special area study and plan. If a small part of the ecosystem is included but not impacted, the developer can run through the normal county route. Hofstetter said Celebration Pointe includes a section of Hogtown Creek. But the developer said they would leave the entire part untouched and avoid a special plan. The first owner-initiated study concluded this year with the Lee property on Parker Road, 122nd Street, about a mile south of SW 24th Avenue. Hofstetter said the county has done these studies before, but an owner has never started one. The Lee property includes around 66% of the Hickory Sink strategic ecosystem. The Hickory Sink ecosystem was ranked 29 in terms of ecological value in the KNB report. Unincorporated Alachua County contains 90% of the strategic ecosystems, and the city of Gainesville contains 6%, followed by other municipalities. Building in rural agricultural areas in the county requires the use of cluster developments. If an owner wants to build on 100 acres with a density allowance of 1-5 units per acre, the development could contain 100-500 units. But the county comprehensive plan requires that development be grouped together on only 50% of the available land. The cluster developments allow the other 50% to remain open. The same happens for strategic ecosystems in the county. The study identifies which areas should be included in the 50% open areas—which are protected from development—and which area can be built upon. Photo by Seth Johnson A trio of White Ibis perch at Barr Hammock Preserve. “The strategic ecosystem requires you to first make sure that the area you are setting aside for open space is what’s critical to protect that strategic ecosystem,” Hofstetter said. “So, it requires you to analyze the strategic ecosystem and identify that first, and then figure out how you’re going to develop.” These developments also get one extra unit above the zoning density for every 10 acres conserved. Factors that set aside these 47 areas The 1996 KBN report analyzed all properties based on 6 parameters and 12 subparameters. Each parameter scored between a 1 (low priority) and a 5 (high priority). The six main parameters are vegetation value, landscape ecology, hydrology, wildlife habitat value, endangered species habitat value and management potential. Hofstetter said a strategic ecosystem only needs a high score on one of the parameters to qualify, not a combination of medium or high scores. For example, a sinkhole with direct access to the aquifer needs protection regardless of any endangered species are found in the area. He also said that the original boundaries of the KNB report need updating when a study is conducted. The team that compiled the report used aerial and infrared imagery along with driving and getting access to the sites in person. The team used physical charts to map the boundaries, utilizing property lines, roads and natural features. When development takes place at a strategic ecosystem, the county checks the boundaries and resources on site, a process called ground truthing. Hofstetter said the ground truthing cleans up the 1996 boundaries and removes non-strategic areas. Putting people on the ground to recheck the boundaries also allows the county to ensure the land still has the ecological value that placed it on the list to start. Use of strategic ecosystems for conservation Because of their ecological value, Hofstetter said strategic ecosystems scored high for conservation by the county. Since 2000, Alachua County has protected 32,506 acres through the Alachua County Forever program. Hoffstetter said all sales are voluntary from the owners. Some strategic ecosystems, like the Santa Fe River, includes dozens of property owners. Others contain only one. The Weyerhaeuser Company owns thousands of acres of strategic ecosystems. Photo by Seth Johnson Trail at Barr Hammock South. “If the property owners are willing, those typically are our target areas to purchase,” Hofstetter said. The county has purchased parts of Watermelon Pond near Newberry and Barr Hammock Preserve by Micanopy. Other portions, like Bird Island, are under preservation through third parties. At its Nov. 8 meeting, the BOCC moved forward with two additional purchases along the Santa Fe River for a combined estimated cost of just over $1 million for around 263 acres. A county analysis from 2007 shows that 40% of the strategic ecosystems are wetlands. That status already prevents most development, and Hofstetter said purchasing these properties doesn’t hurt the tax roll. Most of the properties have little development potential and therefore small economic value, he said. However, preserving these lands can benefit private neighbors. “We’ve done reports that appear to show that actually the tax base increases as we buy these areas based on the increased land values,” Hofstetter said. Photo by Seth Johnson A dragonfly at Barr Hammock Preserve. Private property value increases nearby because the county’s land—often turned into public preserves—will never change into rows and rows of homes, guaranteeing scenic surroundings for the future. Hofstetter compares it to some of the most valuable real estate in the world: the buildings that front Central Park in New York. “I’m sure, in the past, someone was thinking, ‘why are we saving a park on the most valuable land in the world?’ Yet, that park is what made those properties that much more valuable,” Hofstetter said. At Barr Hammock Preserve, the county still manages the land. A timber harvest started in September, and Hofstetter said the goal is to return to a more natural environment. That means more spaced-out pines instead of dense silviculture and prescribed burning to tame the understories. Overall, he said the strategic ecosystems have helped the county protect resources while retaining options for owners. “I think it’s been an effective tool to protect those critical resources, while not removing property right value,” Hofstetter said.

The county and once upon a time the city as well made growth management and environmental protection high priorities. It’s good to revisit this approach now, in the face of the growthism that has ruined other places. 3 Reply Janice Garry 2 years ago Thank you, Seth, for this excellent article that lays out clearly some land management points that can be confusing. The proposed Lee property development at the Hickory Sink strategic ecosystem is a short-term focus on profit, rather than a long-term focus on preserving our water resources. With direct access to the aquifer in multiple places, this property would serve the current and future generations of humans and other life forms best by being managed without urban density. 1 Reply Featured Local Savings Sign Up Local news in your inbox.

Return to Top Alachua County Forever’s Sweetwater Preserve Clean up UF freshman in the College of Business enrolled in the summer Warrington Welcome class assisted Alachua County Forever (ACF) land managers with the maintenance of Sweetwater Preserve.  On the morning of Saturday July 25th twenty students were divided into two working groups so they were either knee deep in water cleaning trash from Sweetwater Branch or in the floodplain forest removing non-native invasive air potato plants. Because this was the student’s first semester attending UF, this event was for many, their first exposure to a natural area in Alachua County. These events are a win/win activity: the students are introduced to the local ecology and some environmental issues, while the ACF program gains needed assistance managing its preserves. Invasive Plant Control: It takes years of effort to remove invasive species from natural areas using a combination of selective herbicide treatment, manual removal and public education.  Business students that worked with ACF’s Sandra Vardaman learned some of air potato’s history, identification techniques and how it is best removed from natural areas.  They pulled up the plants by the tuber and disposed of them in bags.  Air potato is native to tropical Asia, but was introduced to the America’s via Africa through the slave trade.  It was first introduced to Florida in 1905 and has become one of Florida’s most invasive plants because it grows so quickly and out competes many of our native plants. Cleaning Urban Creeks: Since the upper section of Sweetwater Branch flows through downtown Gainesville it acquires a lot of trash that eventually makes it to Sweetwater Preserve and Paynes Prairie which are downstream.  The students working with ACF’s Kevin Ratkus waded through the water to collect 500 pounds of trash and several car tires from the creek section within the preserve’s boundary.   It was the largest quantity of trash collected in July’s creek & river clean-ups organized by Current Problems Inc. for UF’s College of Business.  The City of Gainesville has installed a few trash traps in the stormwater drains to reduce trash getting in the urban creeks, but littering is still too common for these traps to eliminate waste into our surface waters.  While removing trash the students learned about water quality issues, freshwater ecosystems and regional efforts to protect our local water resources. Events like this are already scheduled for the students enrolled in the fall term Warrington Welcome class, thus keeping ACF Preserves in good condition and exposing incoming students to natural areas and issues in their new hometown.  Alachua County Forever appreciates the assistance that neighbors, friends and students donate to the County Preserves. Return to Top Hummingbirds in Your Garden The Alachua County Extension Office’s Master Gardeners Program invites the public to learn about the hummingbirds that visit Alachua County. Hummingbird expert and tagger Fred Bassett is giving a lecture on Friday, September 18, 2009, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Hilton Conference Center (1714 SW 34th St., Gainesville) Bassett will talk about the use of specific plants and other techniques for attracting hummingbirds to a backyard garden during winter and summer. “Many people are unaware that hummingbirds may spend the winter in their yards if conditions are right. Leave a feeder up all winter, and you may have a special hummer spend the winter with you,” says Bassett. “It’s very exciting to play host to a tiny bejeweled winter visitor.” Seating is limited. Free tickets are available prior to the event at either the Alachua County Extension Office (2800 NE 39th Avenue, Gainesville) or Wild Birds Unlimited (4215 NW 16th Blvd, Gainesville).

Return to Top Alachua County Purchases First Wild Spaces In July 2009, Alachua County purchased two environmentally significant properties using funds from the Wild Spaces and Public Places Local Government Infrastructure Surtax. The 40-acre Gladstone Property was jointly acquired with the St. John’s River Water Management District and closes a hole in the District’s 6,000-acre Newnans Lake and Gum Root Swamp Conservation Areas in eastern Alachua County. The 92-acre Edwards property is on the south rim of Paynes Prairie State Park and was part of a larger purchase of 280 acres involving the District, the State Recreation and Park Service and the City of Gainesville. Both tracts will be managed by the County’s acquisition partners as new units of their respective preserves. The Wild Spaces and Public Places Surtax was approved by the voters in the November 2008 elections, and creates an estimated $15 million to continue the efforts of the successful Alachua County Forever land conservation program. The remaining $15 million is earmarked for various Municipal recreation projects and a senior center. “We are fortunate to have a community that recognizes the important role that green spaces and recreational opportunities play in maintaining our quality of life,” said Ramesh Buch, Alachua County Forever Program Manager. “With the new conservation funds, we will be able to conserve and pass on to our children the best of our natural heritage that will not only protect habitats for wildlife, but also preserve the ecological functions that sustains our human community.” Alachua County Forever was created by the voters in 2000. It was initially funded through a 0.25 mill property tax capped at a total of $29 million.  To date the County has used $27 million of local dollars to leverage $52 million of federal, State and private funds to protect 17,400 acres of property. For more information, contact Ramesh Buch at (352) 264-6800, or visit http://www.alachuacountyforever.us .

The Alachua County Environmental Protection Department invites residents to participate in an ecologist-led, family-friendly hike at Barr Hammock Preserve. The hike is on Sunday, October 29, 2023, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Hikers will meet by the informational kiosk at the Barr Hammock Preserve South Trailhead (300 S.E. 175th Ave, Micanopy). The event is free, but participants must register by calling 352-451-7818 or email mneelands@alachuacounty.us . Space is limited to 20 people. Many of Florida’s native plants flower in autumn, and visitors can expect to see a variety of colorful blooms. The terrain of this three-mile hike is flat, but there is very little shade. Participants should bring comfortable walking shoes, sun protection, and drinking water. The nearly 6,000-acre Barr Hammock Preserve is actively managed through the Alachua County Forever Program. Alachua County Forever is the voter-approved initiative to acquire, improve, and manage environmentally sensitive lands to protect water resources, wildlife habitat, and natural areas suitable for resource-based recreation. The referendum was first passed in November 2000. It was funded again by the voters in 2008, 2016, and 2022 with the Wild Spaces and Public Places Referendum.

It was a gorgeous day and over 150 people attended the event on Saturday. Thank you to Ramesh Buch, Kelly McPherson and Sandra Vardaman of the Alachua County Forever program for all of their hard work in preparing for the opening of the preserve. Cutting the Ribbon! Chris Bird, Alachua County Environmental Protection Director; Alachua Co. Commissioner Robert Hutchinson; Alachua Co. Commission Chair Mike Byerly; Alachua Co. Forever Program Manager Ramesh Buch; Alachua Co. Commissioner Lee Pinkoson, NRCS representative, and Interim Alachua Co. Manager Rick Drummond. Photo by Mark Sexton. Overall, there are 5,719 acres to the preserve, making it the largest of the county’s conservation acquisitions. The majority of its landscape is marsh and wet prairie that is hydrologically tied to Paynes Prairie; all part of a larger greenway system that connects conservation areas together throughout Florida. The Barr Hammock Levy Prairie Preserve is part of the greenway that connects the Ocala National Forest to the Goethe State Forest. The Conservation Trust was a partner in the grant applications and has agreed to assist Alachua County with field trips and educational programs at the Preserve.Attendees at the Grand Opening learned all about the preserve at information exhibits and then went off on foot, bicycle, or on a hayride to see the lands and their flora and fauna firsthand. Terri Mashour,  Gator Glob Nature Contributor, shared highlights from the event on-line: “The comissioners described the property and it’s karst characteristics, very thin limestone that allows rain water to seep directly into the Floridan Aquifer, our drinking water. They explained the greenway connection that Barr Hammock Preserve fills in, allowing linkages for our Florida black bears (YES! There are black bears in our county!), our deer, our birds to move about the area without being blocked by development. They explained the importance of the partnerships that gathered to find funding to purchase this great expanse of open space, in a time when funding for purchasing conservation lands is scarce.”Terri also operates Gainesville Ecotours, which hosted a hike during the event. Gainesville Ecotours will be working with CTF to bring 12 hikes to the public in the coming year. Thanks to Terri for sharing the photos from the event. The grand opening was covered by TV 20.

Policy 1.1.6 Alachua County shall participate with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation Planning Organization to protect historic resources and properties during right-of-way acquisition, construction, operation, and maintenance of the roadway system in Alachua County. OBJECTIVE 2.1 Conserve and extend the useful life of historic resources and properties through the identification, protection and/or rehabilitation of properties significant on a national, regional, or local level consistent with preserving their historic or archaeological character and value.  Strategies for preservation of historic resources and properties shall include: · Incentives for maintenance, restoration and rehabilitation, and stabilization. · Incentives for productive and adaptive reuse. · Incentives for private ownership and responsible stewardship. · Opportunity for acquisition/conservation by governmental entities, private interests, or not-for-profit organizations. · Establishment of historic and/or archaeological districts. Policy 2.1.1 Alachua County shall maintain and update, on an annual basis, an inventory of historic resources and properties listed, eligible, or potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or listed, eligible, or potentially eligible for listing in regional or local registers. Policy 2.1.2 By 2002, Alachua County shall contact owners of historic resources and properties eligible or potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places to encourage nomination of such properties to the National Register and to offer assistance in the preparation of applications to the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Review Board for inclusion in the National Register. Policy 2.1.3 Historic Districts shall, where appropriate, be established by the Board of County Commissioners through a public hearing process.  Land development regulations including the establishment of overlay zoning for Historic Preservation shall be established to preserve and protect these areas from the encroachment of incompatible land uses.  Complimentary environmental, natural, and other features may be used as factors for determining the boundaries of potential historical or archaeological districts of national, regional or local significance. Policy 2.1.4 The County shall provide assistance to individuals, organizations, and other entities to preserve, restore, or establish historic landmarks. County funds may be spent for the acquisition or preservation, restoration, or establishment of landmarks where archeological, architectural or historic merit has been adequately established.

Policy 2.1.8 Alachua County shall assist, as appropriate, in the redevelopment and adaptive reuse of historically significant structures through such programs as the Ad Valorem Tax Exemption.  This shall include assisting private property owners of historically significant structures in applying for and utilizing state and federal assistance programs as appropriate. OBJECTIVE 3.1 Evaluate and, where appropriate, conserve, protect, or acquire sites and areas of archaeological significance. Policy 3.1.1 The County, by 2001, shall initiate a research project to identify and model areas of potential archaeological significance.

Policy 3.1.3 The Land Development Regulations and the Development Review Committee shall provide for analysis of resources, and avoidance, minimization, and mitigation (in that order of preference) of adverse impacts when development involves properties that contain, or have reasonable potential to harbor, resources of archaeological significance. When proposed developments are located in such areas, the County or the applicant shall contact the Florida Department of State Division of Historical Resources for a recommendation on the need to conduct an assessment survey for potentially archaeological resources.  When such survey is recommended, the County shall require the same. Following completion of the archaeological survey project identified in Policy 3.1.1 the Development Review Committee may require an assessment survey and related analyses for developments proposed in identified sensitivity zones without recommendation of the Division of Historical Resources.  The Development Review Committee also may require surveys and analyses outside of identified sensitivity zones, but only upon recommendation of the Division of Historical Resources. Development orders for such areas shall be conditioned, where appropriate, to accomplish the following: (a) Insure proper archeological investigation prior to construction and where appropriate, avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of impacts; and (b) Preserve and provide perimeter buffering around outstanding archeological sites.

Such requirement is enforced under Florida Statutes, sections 872.02 and 872.05. OBJECTIVE 4.1 Evaluate and, where appropriate, conserve, protect or acquire sites and areas of paleontological significance. Policy 4.1.1 The County, by 2001, shall contact the Florida Museum of Natural History for recommendations on areas of known or potential paleontological significance pursuant to FS. 240.516. Policy 4.1.2 Significant paleontological sites shall be protected from destruction in the absence of appropriate analysis and mitigation. Policy 4.1.3 The Land Development Regulations and the Development Review Committee shall provide for analysis of resources, and avoidance, minimization, and mitigation (in that order of preference) of adverse impacts when development review involves properties that contain, or have a reasonable potential to harbor, resources of paleontological  significance. When proposed developments are located in such areas, the County or the applicant shall contact the Florida Museum of Natural History, as appropriate, for a recommendation on the need to conduct an assessment survey for potentially significant paleontological resources. Development orders for such areas shall be conditioned, where appropriate, to accomplish the following: (a) Insure proper paleontological investigation prior to construction and, where appropriate, avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of impacts. (b) Preserve and provide perimeter buffering around and paleontological sites. This may include, if necessary, alteration to the proposed or originally approved development plan to accommodate preservation of such sites. Where paleontological sites are to be preserved, incentives to encourage retention of these areas may be provided.

The trails will be closed beginning Monday, September 19, 2022. Depending on the weather, the closure is expected to remain in effect for three months. During this time, a timber harvest will occur over 311 acres of the Preserve. In addition to heavy logging equipment operating in the woods and trees falling, there will be logging trucks on the service roads, which partially overlap with the trail system. Trail closure was identified as the best way to protect public safety during the timber sale operation. Visit the Barr Hammock Preserve webpage for specific dates for trail closure. For visitor safety, the public is expected to observe all closure signs. Unauthorized persons may be cited for trespass. When work is completed, the County will remove the closure signs and advise the public that the trails are open again. The Barr Hammock- Levy Loop trailhead remains closed through Friday, September 16, 2022, for habitat restoration activities. The Levy Loop trailhead is located at 14920 S.E. 11th Drive, Micanopy. The nearly 6,000-acre Barr Hammock Preserve is actively managed through the Alachua County Forever Program, the voter-approved initiative to acquire, improve and manage environmentally sensitive lands to protect water resources, wildlife habitat, and natural areas suitable for resource-based recreation. The referendum was first passed in November 2000. It was again funded by the voters in 2008 and 2016 with the Wild Spaces and Public Places Referendum. Learn more about Alachua County Forever .

      "text": "County adds 2,800 acres to wish list News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Guardian Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals LOCAL County adds 2,800 acres to wish list Cleveland Tinker cleveland.tinker@gvillesun.com Five properties — totaling nearly 2,800 acres — have been added to the Alachua County conservation lands' wish list. County Commissioners added the properties to the Alachua County Forever acquisition list Tuesday, and will use Wild Spaces Public Places money to buy them. The properties' estimated value is $5.2 million, according to the Alachua County Property Appraiser's office. \"They (the five properties) were nominated by citizens of Alachua County and reviewed by the (Alachua County) Land Conservation Board who found the lands had resources worthy of conservation,\" said Charlie Houder, county director of Parks and Conservation Lands. \"It’s the Land Conservation Board’s responsibility to determine if the lands meet the goals of Alachua County Forever.\" Alachua County Forever was approved by voters in 2000, and succeeded by Wild Spaces Public Places. Wild Spaces Public Places is a half-cent tax Alachua County voters adopted during the November 2016 general election. The funds go toward conservation and improvements to parks throughout the county and are expected to generate about $130 million over the tax's eight-year life span, ending in 2025. The properties added to the list are worthy, Commissioner Robert Hutchinson said. \"The county's continued focus is on lands that are big, wild and connected,\" Hutchinson said. \"They're getting harder to find, so these particular parcels are a good addition.\" The process to buy environmentally sensitive lands include citizens nominating lands to the Alachua County Forever Program that are evaluated and then recommended to the county commission by the Land Conservation Board. Once the commission determines it’s possible to get a contract to purchase a property, two appraisals and title searches are done. The property is surveyed after the county has a contract to buy a property. The properties added to the list include 28.63 acres near Barr Hammock in southwest Gainesville, which, if bought by the county, will be a key component of an ecological and recreational corridor between Barr Hammock Preserve and Price’s Scrub State Park in Marion County. The property has forest lands with hardwood, messic and pine hammocks that surround two wetland areas. Another is a 42.21-acre property between Little Lake Santa Fe and Hickory Pond, just south of the Santa Fe Swamp Conservation Area owned by the Suwannee River Water Management District. The property includes a hardwood forest and basin swamp, and would be managed as part of the Lake Alto Preserve. Another is a 317-acre piece of property on the northwest shore of Lake Alto that shares its boundary with the Santa Fe Swamp Conservation Area and the city of Waldo’s Boat Ramp Park. The property is an important connector because of its proximity to conservation and recreational lands and surface water, county officials say. Another is a 2,168-acre conservation easement that’s 3.5 miles long and connects the Santa Fe River to the county’s Mill Creek Preserve. Also, it’s adjacent to the Alachua County Forever and Suwannee River Water Management District’s Santa Fe Ranch properties. Mostly cattle pasture, the property supports at least 13 karst features, including seeps, sinkholes and springs, as well as forests, ponds and creeks. The property buffers 2,400 feet of the Santa Fe River. The other property is 15 acres on Watermelon Pond, and is adjacent to a property already on the list. The property includes sand hills and a xeric hammock, which is an evergreen forest on well-drained sandy soil. Negotiations will soon begin with landowners, and if it looks like deals are possible, the county will verify the titles to the properties and get fair market appraisals for them, Houder said. \"We will first find out who is the real owner of the property, and see if anybody has mineral rights to the property and things of that nature,\" he said. Including the properties just added to the acquisition list, the county is looking to buy about a dozen properties through Alachua County Forever, Houder said. \"About 100 properties have been placed on the list over the years, most of which are on hold,\" Houder said.
