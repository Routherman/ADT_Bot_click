      "text": "Sarasota building official resigns amid turmoil over medieval fair News Sports Ticket Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals SARASOTA Sarasota building official resigns amid turmoil over Sarasota Medieval Fair work Timothy Fanning Sarasota Herald-Tribune SARASOTA COUNTY — Sarasota County’s top building official, under investigation by various agencies for her involvement in developing a new home for the Sarasota Medieval Fair , has resigned. The Planning and Development Services department accepted Kathleen Croteau’s resignation on May 12. Neither Croteau or her supervisor explained the reason for her departure, though it appears that she was forced out. “Per our discussion, I am resigning my position effective today,” Croteau told Planning and Development Services director Matt Osterhoudt in a May 12 letter. Croteau’s involvement with the new 50-acre site for the Sarasota Medieval Fair off State Road 70 in Myakka City has drawn scrutiny from both the Florida Department of Transportation and the Manatee County Inspector General’s Office. In case you missed it: Sarasota Medieval Fair moving to Manatee County In other news: Sarasota County board gets earful over voter-approved election initiative Records also show that Croteau routinely performed work duties associated with the massive land clearing and construction project at 29641 State Road 70. She reportedly used her county-issued vehicle to travel to and from the project while on the clock, which is against county policy. Croteau did not respond to phone calls requesting comment. A county spokeswoman declined to make Osterhoudt available for an interview or respond to questions about the resignation. “Sarasota County does not comment on employees' personal matters,” said spokeswoman Brianne Grant. Croteau replaced Greg Yantorno in 2011 after the Herald-Tribune revealed that he illegally waived fees that cost the government at least $7.4 million in uncollected revenue. She earned $111,800 annually. Guy McCauley, the deputy building inspector, will lead the department on an interim basis. Construction on the Medieval Fair site began last fall. Michael Gallen, the general counsel for the Manatee County Inspector General’s Office, said he could not comment about the investigation because it is still active. He said the probe began in late March in response to complaints from residents and reporting by the Bradenton Herald . The newspaper reported how investigators are looking into how Manatee’s code enforcement office did not properly investigate complaints about construction on the property. Because the property owners are family members of Croteau and her son Jeremy Croteau, code enforcement officials allegedly ignored un-permitted work. Kathleen Croteau’s name is on driveway permits submitted to FDOT, records show. In April, FDOT began investigating how a permit was issued for minor improvements to the fair’s entrance off SR 70. Croteau, whose name is on the permit, reportedly withheld the true scope of work on the driveway, telling the state transportation agency that the narrow driveway would be used for residential purposes. The fair typically draws about 20,000 people a year. The investigation that concluded earlier this month said that she would have to submit a new permit application, according to an agency spokesman. After being held for 15 years in the Ringling Woods behind the Sarasota Fairgrounds, the annual Sarasota Medieval Fair announced in October that it found a permanent home at the newly named “Woods of Mallaranny.” That’s the name of the 50-acre SR 70 property owned by Mallaranny LLC . Jeremy Croteau manages the company and is the president of the fair. The property was purchased in September, records show. Construction, which began in the fall, is to create a permanent home that will create “an entire medieval village that’s only limited by our imaginations and dreams,” according to a news release about the project.
