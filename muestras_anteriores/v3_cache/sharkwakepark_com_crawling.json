That’s why we’re committed to building and operating some of the best family-friendly outdoor entertainment centers in the world. Since opening the North Myrtle Beach location in 2016, our founder Greg Norman Jr. – son of World Golf Hall of Fame member Greg Norman – has continued to expand his vision.  In 2019, he unveiled our new flagship location in West Palm Beach, adding a second park for those young and young at heart to enjoy cable watersports and unforgettable memories on the Obstacle Island—one of the largest floating playgrounds on the East Coast. After a long day on the water, guests can relax at the Shark Shack and enjoy a cold one on the viewing deck while they watch friends and family ride. Who We Are Greg Norman, Jr. Founder & CEO Growing up with a passion for watersports, Greg Norman Jr. spent 15 years traveling the world as a professional kiteboarder and wakeboarder. After graduating from the University of Miami with a degree in Business Management, Greg joined his father, Hall of Fame golfer Greg Norman, at the family business working as part of the Business Development team at Great White Shark Enterprises. Inspired by his father to combine his personal passion and entrepreneurial drive, Greg decided to utilize his extensive experience in both the wakeboarding and business realms to open Shark Wake Park.
