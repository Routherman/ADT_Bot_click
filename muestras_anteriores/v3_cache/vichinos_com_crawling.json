Dwayne “The Broc” Johnson features roasted broccoli, Catalpa Farm’s sausage, artichoke hearts, mozzarella, cherry pepper aioli and marinara. Additional Menu items include house-made Garlic Bread (that is made from their flavorful, signature pizza dough) soup and salads (featuring their delicious local Chop Salad), Sharables (house-made Meatballs, organic amish Chicken Wings) and Sandwiches (Roasted Pork Sandwich featuring Catalpa Farm’s Pork, Burger featuring Perkins Farm’s angus beef) The well-rounded drink menu offers a selection of draft beers, red and white wine and inventive signature cocktails, such as Vinny’s Drink featuring Jack Daniels Rye, amaro and an orange peel served over a large ice cube. During the week, Vinny's offers Happy Hour specials Monday through Friday from 3 to 6 p.m. Guests can sip on Local Craft Draft, Glass of Wine and a Beer & Garlic Bread combo for a discounted price.
