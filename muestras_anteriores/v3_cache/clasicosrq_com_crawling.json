Customer Reviews: “We had an excellent experience dining here for an early dinner. The place was nicely decorated and had a great ambiance. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. Drinks were ordered and arrived quickly. They were also very accommodating with some special requests we had with our baby. We started off by ordering a small plate of meatballs, as well as a wedge salad. They were delicious. The entrees we ordered were the bolognese, chicken Parmesan, pork chop and chicken pesto pasta. Everything was fantastic! Even the kids pizza was large and tasty. Our entire party enjoyed all of the food and had no complaints at all. The service was excellent throughout. We can’t wait to go back and would definitely recommend Clasico for a wonderful meal!” – Tee O. “We had the most amazing dinner at Clasico last night. Our server, Jade, was EXCELLENT. She was so kind, so engaged, and even got us a champagne toast to celebrate our bride-to-be. The hosts were very gracious as well, accommodating our table change. The food was so good, I had the steak tips Gorgonzola gnocchi which was absolutely incredible. I would go back for just that dish. Drinks, food, and service were all superb. Can’t recommend it enough!” – Valerie and Jaden Robideau “This is a regular stop for us, we love the food and the service is great. My favorite is the salmon, cooked medium to perfection and served over asparagus and mashed potatoes but I ordered it with the lemon risotto instead, it has great flavor. My husband enjoys their bucatini and meatballs. The inside is warm, comfortable and inviting and the outside seating provides the feeling of being seated on the streets of Italy due to the foliage and people passing by.” – Michelle S.

Kaess brings over 30 years of experience in the restaurant and hospitality industry to Clasico while Locke has been a chef for 10 years. Originally from Alabama, Kaess began his career in New York scooping ice cream. Kaess also worked as an Assistant Wine Buyer, Food and Beverage Manager and Executive Chef throughout his extensive career. He spent eight years as a Culinary Partner with PF Chang’s and was selected to be the opening Executive Chef for “international” expansion in Puerto Rico where he opened two restaurants for the brand. Prior to joining Clasico, Kaess was the General Manager for a fine dining establishment in Orlando for the last three years. Locke hails from Gainesville and began his culinary career by watching cooking shows as a child with his grandmother, replicating the dishes they saw on TV in her kitchen. As he got older his family opened a BBQ restaurant in Auburndale. They participated in Florida’s competitive BBQ circuit which yielded numerous accolades, particularly in categories such as pulled pork, ribs, and the quintessential BBQ cut, brisket. Locke’s journey continued with time spent as a chef for the esteemed Levy Restaurants as well as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Orlando Magic and Walt Disney World. “Adding Matt and David to the Clasico family is tremendous,” said Clasico Director of Operations Matt Goldstein. “The experience and expertise they each bring to the table will be greatly beneficial to the growth and success of our restaurant.” Clasico Chophouse and Taproom is located at 775 Brandon Town Center Drive, Brandon.
