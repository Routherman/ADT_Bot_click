WRONG ORDER AGAIN 1.0 I just received the WRONG order AGAIN. Customer service sucks. No real person who can solve the problem Service wants a review, then sends verifying number through ANOTHER email, which causes me to lose connection. BOO!!! Read full review Patricia F Taj Apr 17, 2025 I lost the person In was speaking to. Instead of trying again to get problem resolved. I tried getting back on Grove site to place order. I was able to do so quickly. 5.0 I would much rather actually speak to a person instead of having to type everything out. I am not the fastest typer and it is just so aggravating to not be able to speak to someone! Read full review Annastacia Zev Apr 8, 2025 Missing Item 1.0 I ordered from Grove Collaborative and was really excited. Once my order arrived, it was missing an item I'd already been charged for. There was no information about the missing item. They didn't email to say the item was out of stock, just left it to me to try to contact them. No one answered the phone and they said I'd hear back in about a week. I emailed through their website and someone did respond, but they did not credit me back the money to my credit card, they put it on account with Grove. Forcing me to shop there again. Additionally, when I said I didn't want a credit, I wanted a refund, they stopped answering my emails. Awful customer service. I'm going to look for another site for my shopping.

Learn more or close to accept. × Skip to content Stories Guides Events Shop About Stories Guides Events Shop About Search Search COMMUNITY PARTNER So Tampa Grove SOHO debuts new tiki bar in South Tampa January 23, 2023 • By Andrew Harlan Grove SOHO brings wild tiki flavors to Tampa January 23, 2023 • By Andrew Harlan 843 SHARES Facebook Twitter It’s alway a party at Grove SOHO. The vibrant energy of the owners is matched by the highly photogenic tropical oasis they’ve built in South Tampa. Grove’s new tiki bar held its grand opening on January 21. That party included a pig roast and an array of the most Instagrammable, TikTok-able cocktails we’ve ever seen. The drink that clearly stole the show is Joe vs The Volcano, a massive concoction for at least four drinkers served in a specialty glass. It’s made with light rum, dark rum, house-made orgeat, house made lavender syrup, pineapple juice, and grenadine. It’s all served with a flaming lime boat. Located at 406 S Howard Ave, Grove is far more than just a cocktail hub. The menu includes light delights such as Szechuan tofu salad, coco veggie noodles with buffalo cauliflower, tropical buffalo pork, and mojo edamame. Diners can also build their own Hawaiian bowls, or order something sweet like the pineapple brioche bread pudding. ADVERTISEMENT Saturn’s Ring: A gin based Tiki cocktail featuring house made orgeat, passion fruit, orange, and lime juices There are a huge number of tropical cocktails to choose from, so we’re just going to list a few that caught our attention: An Ode to Donn: Specialty Glass. Iconic Tiki cocktail made with Bacardi 4 year, Havana Club Anejo, orange liqueur, and fresh citrus juices. Agave Colada: Specialty Glass. A smoky riff on a Pina Colada featuring coconut tequila, mezcal, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. Honolulu Hangover: Help make the pain go away with dark rum, over proof rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, and coconut cream. Hawayee 5-0: A 50’s classic featuring coconut rum, blue curacao, orange juice, and pineapple juice. Patio Pounder: Peach & rosemary vodka, lemonade, lavender simple syrup, pea flower extract. Extremely crushable. Ghost Ship: Grove’s take on the Fog Cutter, combining rum, gin, brandy, lime juice, orange juice, lavender syrup, and sherry cream. Grove offers two mocktails: a lavender orgeat lemonade, and a nada colada. Keep up with the newest tiki hangout in Tampa on Instagram .

On stage. On tour. Online. Welcome to Soho Theatre, London’s most vibrant producer for new theatre, comedy and cabaret. A charity and social enterprise, we are driven by a passion for the work we produce, the artists we work with and the audiences we attract. We own our own home, Soho Theatre in the heart of London’s West End. A former Synagogue, we raised funds, purchased and redeveloped it, opening it in March 2000. Today it is one of the capital’s busiest theatre and comedy venues, with a year-round festival programme and a buzzing bar. Our roots date back to the early 1970s at the Soho Poly Theatre. Small but influential, Soho Poly was radical and relevant, capturing the excitement and innovation of its time. Today our work is wide-ranging, drawing from this fringe heritage, and adding a queer, punk, counter-culture flavour. We champion voices that challenge from outside of the mainstream, and sometimes from within it too. We value entertainment and a great night out. We produce and co-produce new plays, work with associate artists and present the best new emerging theatre companies and comedians. We present the early work of countless UK artists (many who become industry giants), and we present many international artists’ London debuts. We have a thriving variety of artist and talent development programmes, artists under commission and in development, and two new writing awards including the national Verity Bargate Award for new playwrights. Work extends far beyond our Dean Street home, with a UK and international touring programme and connections. We present shows and scout talent at Edinburgh Festival Fringe and are the UK’s leading presenter of Indian comedians and regularly present work there. We film shows and create our own digital work seen across our social platforms and inflight. Currently we are expanding our team as we have recently opened our exciting new second venue in London, Soho Theatre Walthamstow. A culmination of many years of Soho’s work, in collaboration with a grassroots local campaign, to save a glorious, 1930s art deco venue with an incredible heritage. Reinvented as a 1,000-capacity venue for world-class comedy, panto, performance and participation – a ‘local theatre with a national profile’, Soho Theatre Walthamstow opened in May 2025 to great acclaim. Led by a collaborative and diverse senior team and board, Soho Theatre is an exciting place to work with a strong team ethic, fast paced, and with opportunities and intent for staff development and progression.
