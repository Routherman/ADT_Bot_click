Founded in 1850 and then called only \"Fieldhouse\" , the club was originally located at John Bright's Fieldhouse Mill off Whitworth Road in Rochdale. In 1895 the club played competitive cricket in what was then known as the South East Lancashire League and after a break for the first world war the club began playing competitive cricket again in 1921 in the South Lancashire cricket league where it remained until 1994 From left to right: The original \"fieldhouse\" gate that the players still walk through to take to the field, the fire damaged clubhouse, the beautiful outside terrace area and finally the stunning view of ground and clubhouse In 1982 the club relocated to its current home on Hollin Lane in Bamford Rochdale, where it is still situated today. In 1994 the club joined the Saddleworth and District Cricket League and at the same time additional investment was made into the club infrastructure. The last ten years of competitive matches in this league brought with it over seven regional cup winners' trophies and six first division championships combined with many trophies for the juniors. In September 2008 the club received a major setback when, despite the best attempts of four teams of firefighters, the club was ravaged by fire after an arson attack and the club yet again had to begin the process of not only rebuilding the clubhouse but also trying to find the revenues to replace those that were lost through the lack of events through 2008 and 2009. Despite this huge setback the process of rebuilding began and since then the club has never looked back. It now boasts argueably the best cricket facilities and function room in the locality. The club is particularly proud of its junior teams and coaching sessions with under 9s, 11s, and 13s, with an under 15s side also planned for next year.The development of our junior section is at the very heart of what the club looks to achieve.\n\n\t\t\t\t  Our objectives are clear â we want to foster a happy, safe and unpressurised environment where children can develop a love for the game that they can take through life and along the way, produce the next generation of cricketers. The club has SKY TV, shows live football, cricket and major sporting events and is the perfect place to enjoy a drink in a cosy relaxed atmosphere Our clubhouse is available for hire to the local community and we believe it is an ideal venue to host your private function. Whether it be a Birthday or Special Occasion that you are having, our function room is perfect.It has a capacity of 150+ people and there is a fully licensed bar. Being a sports and social club our drink prices are very reasonable and we will also try our best to cater for any special requests that you may have, just make sure you let us know in advance.
