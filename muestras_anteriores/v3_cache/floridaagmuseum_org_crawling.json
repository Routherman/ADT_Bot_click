GCREC has been at its present location since 2005, after over 80 years of existence at two previous sites in Bradenton and Dover.  The centers were previously established because of particular agronomic needs in the region.  Historically, the Bradenton location focused on vegetable and cut-flower ornamental production.  In recent years, environmental issues, protection of natural resources, as well as urban landscape and land use changes, have become important.  The merger of location sites, identification of new research thrust areas and the addition of a teaching program with faculty located at Hillsborough Community College in Plant City, have given the faculty of GCREC many challenges and opportunities to meet the needs of Floridians. The vision and mission of the center have been consistent throughout its nearly 100 years of existence and are in concert with the land-grant mission of service to the state of Florida.  Specifically, the center developes and disseminates new scientific knowledge and technology that will assist Florida's producers to be competitive, both nationally and in the world economy.  Key elements of the center's research mission are to develop low-input horticultural crop production and pest management systems, to develop conservation strategies to improve the sustainability of agriculture and urban landscape, to improve the genetics of commercially important horticultural crops, and to address major economic challenges to increase the profitability and sustainability of Florida agriculture.  The faculty also excel in the teaching and extension functions of UF/IFAS. GCREC strives to support all of its faculty, staff, students, and postdocs. In addition, the community and its engagement remains a priority to the center. The GCREC for All group was established to help support endeavors that engage all stakeholders, and is comprised of faculty, staff, students, and postdocs. Through development of recruitment, outreach and mentoring programs, we hope to provide resources, tools and support for all who are a part of and interact with the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center. We are also very fortunate to have the support and guidance of our Gulf Coast Council, comprised of leaders from the private sector, commodity-related organizations and state officials.  The purpose of the council is to assist in identifying needs related to the agricultural industries in the region and state.  Their input is invaluable in helping set research priorities, so GCREC my continue to provide new solutions and innovations for the agricultural community. Core Programs of the Future: Genetic improvement and cultivar development (disease and nematode resistance, improved horticultural characteristics) of tomato, strawberry, emerging crops, landscape and ornamental crops. Development of alternative crops for Florida production (i.e. hops, artichokes,pomegranates, blackberries, hemp). Sustainable and integrated biological, chemical and cultural pest management systems (diseases, nematodes, insects, and weeds), including the development and use of disease forecasting or decision support systems. Best management practices for sustainable crop and ornamental production systems, and urban tree and landscape management that conserve and protect soil and water resources. Environmental impact of known and emerging contaminants on surface and groundwater. Economic for profitable vegetable, fruit and ornamental production.  Analyze labor and trade issues to address industry sustainability. Remote sensing applications for agricultural and environmental monitoring Use of artificial intelligence to enhance horticultural production with an emphasis on phenomics in plant breeding, precision pest management, and mechanical harvesting. The UF/IFAS Gulf Coast Research and Education Center has proudly served Floridians for nearly 100 years, and we look forward to being around for decades to come. Jack Rechcigl Center Director and Professor General Information The University of Florida/IFAS Gulf Coast Research and Education Center is a 475-acre facility located in the heart of Hillsborough County.  GCREC features working research fields and state-of-the-art clean housing and laboratory facilities.

Testimonial Cultivating opportunity The Urban Ag Internship has been transformative, teaching me practical skills while fostering a sense of community with the people I work with. I’m grateful for the support and opportunities it has provided as I’m able to learn day by day and meet great people along the way. Hana Yang, 18 | Sacramento Sending Enrique, one of our most respected employees, through the Apprenticeship Program was one of the best decisions for our farm. Enrique not only learned new techniques and grew his personal network that he still uses today, more importantly, he built up his confidence in himself.  He learned how to question the status quo and find ways to make influential changes on our farm.  Through his experience in the Apprenticeship Program, he has become an invaluable manager on our farm managing our shop. This program doesn’t just train future farmers, it builds stronger, more innovative agricultural leaders. David Ogilvie | Wilson Vineyards The Explorer Course did not shy away from sharing the risks, challenges, and hardships that small farmers face, and it was designed to really make us think about our values and goals and where we wanted to take our farm journey, whether that was moving on to start a farm business, work on a farm, or be involved with farming in some other way. Every risk, every challenge, every opportunity that we discussed in class really sparked my interest and I came to realize that, yes, that is what I want for my life, and ultimately it led me to continue my farm journey with CLBL.

In a region of constant change due to sea-level rise and continued population growth, FLREC scientists research multiple aspects of natural, agricultural, and highly urbanized tropical and subtropical landscape systems to develop management strategies to reduce the economic and ecological impacts of invasive plants, animals, and microorganisms at different spatial scales from the microscopic to the global. The program focuses at UF IFAS FLREC include urban and landscape ecology, landscape and turfgrass management, urban pest ecology and management, invasive wildlife issues, aquatic plant management, geospatial analysis, and biodiversity of insects and nematodes.  FLREC has added faculty strength in microbial ecology, nutrient cycling, applied phycology, palm pathology, and palm management since 2020.  The 18 tenure-track faculty members, including the center director, are the best at addressing issues related to the urban/natural interface presented by our proximity to the Everglades. FLREC is recognized nationally and internationally for termite control and ecology as well as a national leader in aquatic plant management, invasive wildlife management, and turfgrass and palm management. Vision, Mission and Values Vision To be the leader in addressing emerging and persistent ecological issues in tropical systems. Mission To develop and provide science-based solutions to agricultural, environmental, and urban challenges. History FLREC was established in 1953 at the current location of Heritage Park in Plantation, FL (Broward County). The program was relocated to Forman Field, a Naval Air Training Facility (3205 College Avenue) in 1968. In 1942 the Forman family allowed the Navy to build a training field for pilots. When the Navy left, the Forman family decided the land would be used to create an educational complex.  In 1962 Nova High School was built followed by the UF FLREC in 1968. In the last decade, the acreage at the center has been reduced by ~35 acres (down to 65 total acres). About 20 acres were transferred (not sold) to Florida Atlantic University, which resulted in a new greenhouse/shadehouse/headhouse complex for the FLREC plus occupation of ca 12,000 ft 2 in the FAU Davie West building (3233 College Avenue) with a 50-year sublease agreement (May 2011-May 2061). Subsequently, the Town of Davie bought 15 acres of FLREC land for a new Water and Sewage Treatment Facility (completed in Nov. 2013). A quarter of those funds (ca $1.4 million) were used to renovate the east wing of the original FLREC 5001 building (30,000 ft 2 built/expanded in 1968/1981), the teaching building (5002), and to add a new pavilion in 2011. 1942-1945 Forman Field was leased to the US Navy as a training base for torpedo bomber pilots. It was operated from 1942 -1945 training thousands of US Navy aviators. During June-August 1943 Ensign George H.W. Bush trained to fly Avengers at the Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale After the Navy was finished with the land, they gave it back to the Forman family who gave it to the town of Davie – with one stipulation – that the land had to be used for educational purposes. Remnants of the original runway from this time can still be seen in aerial photos. The only original runway markings in this area are visible at the current UF IFAS FLREC site. 1953 -1968 FLREC started at 5305 Peters Road​ Plantation, Florida​ “A field laboratory, as part of the Everglades Station system, and called Old (sic) Plantation Field Laboratory, was established near Ft. Lauderdale for research with vegetables, grasses, and other crops of the area.  The land for this unit, approximately 80 acres, was made available on a long-term lease basis through the Board of Commissioners of Broward County .”​ June 30, 1953 The eastern area of Plantation Heritage Park has a rare plant collection.  These trees were initially planted as part of a UF program on new crop evaluation and remained on the site after the move. After the center moved, this site became a regional park in the Broward County Parks Systems ​1968-present The center moved to what was then called Forman Field in July 1968 - 3205 College Ave Davie FL 33314 1953-1970 we were called the Plantation Field Laboratory 1971-1980 our name was changed to Agricultural Research Center, Fort Lauderdale 1981-1983 we were called Agricultural Research and Education Center, Fort Lauderdale 1984 – our name changed for the last time to Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center ​ In 1968, the center was focused on veterinary research on equine piroplasmosis​. The current teaching building is a converted horse barn that was a remnant of this time and some entrances to labs have 48-inch-wide doorways which were used to bring horses into the labs for bloodwork while on the opposite side was a normal doorway for the technician to enter. In 1969, research programs were reoriented to turfgrass and ornamental plant production and management.   Vegetable crop research and agronomic crop research were transferred to other UF/IFAS facilities.​ Aquatic plant management research programs started in 1969​ with a partnership with the USDA. During 1974-76, new faculty were hired to work on emerging issues specifically Citrus black fly and lethal yellowing on palms. 1981 - The original building was expanded to add more labs and office space​. The 1970s and 1980s witnessed an increased emphasis on programs aimed at problems and opportunities in rapidly urbanizing southern Florida. ​ Aquatic plant management research in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture grew as did outreach programs. Aquatic Weed Short Course - invasive aquatic plant control and the introduction and use of native aquatic plants; annual event offered every year. The Urban Entomology program has made tremendous progress in developing new and improved control strategies for termites and other insect pests​ (nematodes, ants, bees) School of Structural Fumigation (offered twice a year) Termite Class The Sentricon baiting system was designed at FLREC by Dr. Nan Yao Su (Invented the first commercial termite bait product. Commercialized as the Sentricon system, the product has been marketed in 32 countries since 1995 to protect over four million homes, and reduced pesticide use by > 10,000 metric tons) Largest termite collection in the world Turf and ornamentals Turf Field Day – an annual event at the center in March 1984 - Academic Programs at FLREC​ started. FLREC was the first off-campus program to offer classes towards a BS degree in CALS. The original program motto was “You don’t have to go to Gainesville to be a Gator.” 2000- Online graduate education and student dormitories (houses) were added. 2001 – Undergraduate courses moved to online delivery​ in 2001 with onsite laboratories. Added undergraduate and graduate programs in Geomatics to current (undergraduate and/or graduate) programs in Plant Science (horticulture), Entomology and Nematology, Plant Pathology, Agronomy, and Wildlife 1990 – 2022 (urban invasive plant/animal issues) Bees Africanized Bee programs aimed at training first responders. South Florida Bee College Caribbean Bee College Orchid Bee Monitoring Palm School – how to grow and use palms in the landscape.

From the sandy southern tip of the peninsula to the more subtropical panhandle, Florida hosts over 1.7 million head of beef cattle, over 125,000 dairy cows, and approximately 500,000 horses in over 3.2 million acres of pastureland and 1.3 million acres of grazed woodland. Besides being home to five out of the 10 largest cow-calf outfits in the country, there are almost 18,500 beef cattle ranchers, producing over 800,000 calves being shipped out west every year. This represents over $1.7 billion annually in revenue from livestock products for the state (USDA NASS 2016), helping to make Florida the 7th state in agricultural exports. The beauty of this: it is mostly produced on strong, forage-based production systems. Recently, forages (re)gained new horizons, with the increased use of cover crops and great potential for integrated livestock-cropping systems. Regained because those practices remount back to the primordium of agriculture. New horizons because the diversification of production systems, increased cost of production, and increased focus on environmental aspects have placed forages on the main stage for sustainable agriculture. Forages are important providers of ecosystem services, being a habitat for wildlife, securing atmospheric carbon in biomass and soil organic matter, regulating nutrient fluxes, and conserving soil and water. The very productive Forage Breeding program at the University of Florida has released over 47 cultivars in the past several years, not including biofuel and turfgrasses. The Forage Team has been an important ally of Florida’s farmers and ranchers, a partnership and a legacy transcendent beyond generations of faculty and producers. In Florida, it is possible to grow a myriad of forage species: from tropical C4 grasses to subtropical legumes, going through high productivity, bioenergy-type canes to brassicas for small ruminants. The very productive Forage Breeding program at the University of Florida has released over 47 cultivars in the past several years, not including biofuel and turfgrasses. Those releases range from more reliable bahiagrass and bermudagrass cultivars to nematode-resistant clovers and tetraploid ryegrasses, reducing costs and increasing productivity. Rust-resistant small grains helped producers by reducing the need for supplemental feed and creating a new niche for beef cattle producers: backgrounding stockers in integrated livestock-cropping systems. Hay is also an important crop in Florida, with around 300,000 acres being harvested annually. High-quality rhizoma peanut hay has also gained space among horse owners and small ruminant producers as an alternative to imported alfalfa hay. Contact Feedback UF/IFAS Forage Program P.O.
