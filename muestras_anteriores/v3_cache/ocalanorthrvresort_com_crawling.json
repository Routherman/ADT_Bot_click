Park staff made sure we had a shaded site in the front of the park. The park is very clean and well cared for. Staff is very attentive. Location is convenient to Gainesville or Ocala, and the park is next to a beautiful horse farm with curious, friendly horses. Great pool and fitness center. Very pet friendly!! We’ve already booked our next stay Site 107 Month of Visit August (4) View All Share Report Lisa D. Scout Reviewed Dec. 7, 2023 Never to return The new corporate owners suck! We and many others were here when it sold and got totally screwed on costs! We were told we could leave our camper for the summer and paid the 75.00 a month for storage in advance. We were held up till Dec 5 due to medical reasons and now it cost 350.00 for the month of November?!?! No loyalty to the people that have been here for years! Corporations suck! I asked 3 times what the monthly cost would be to stay here and not 1 person gave me a price! Wth! All past campers are being blackballed!! What a f...ing Horrible campground this has become! Share Report K Kathryn Scout Reviewed Mar. 1, 2023 Very Good for the Big Guys Staff is very friendly.  Showers are very clean.  Dog Park is nice.  The Dyrt info needs to be updated however.  No tents, no pop-ups allowed.  We are a Ford Transit Conversion Camper built in 2022 and we're allowed a short stay only.  That was what we were looking for so it suited us but we are by far the smallest rig in the place. Site 206 Month of Visit March Share Report Michael J.

Site 115 Month of Visit February Share Report Kaitlynn B. Guide Reviewed Jun. 5, 2022 Great pull throughs! A bit unlevel but I was too amazed by the number of open pull through spots. Site 202 Month of Visit June Share Report J John Scout Reviewed Dec. 28, 2021 Great place to stop in central Florida Stopped here on the way north to get out of the Florida Keys. Stayed 2 nights and used the laundry(wash was 1.50 per load, and 25 cents per 18min for drying). It was very affordable. Very large dog park for off-leash. One weird quirk we noticed was not all sites had a picnic table. Ours was one of those. Here are some notes for data for people interested in staying here and needing connectivity. They have an amazing campground WiFi deployment. I was getting about 15mbs down and 6mbs up. Obviously depending on when people are using it all that can change. I have a Pepwave Max Transit CAT18 modem paired up with a Parsec Husky Pro 7-in-1 4x4 MIMO antenna mounted on our travel trailer. I ran a speedtest from Ookla on my laptop three times per provider while I was deciding which connection to use. I ended up leveraging Speedfusion on my router to bond my best connection with the campground WiFi Verizon LTE Band 66(AWS 1700/2100 MHz) RSSI:-77dBm SINR: 12.7dB RSRP:-108dBm RSRQ:-10.0dB 9.40ms down| 5.03mbs up| 39ms ping AT&T LTE Band 14(700 MHz) RSSI:-53dBm SINR: 20.7dB RSRP:-81dBm RSRQ:-10.0dB 8.51mbs down| 5.53mbs up| 43ms ping Read More Site 173 Month of Visit December Share Report Ellen L. Scout Reviewed Jul. 27, 2021 Country setting close to Gainesville and Ocala Ocala North RV Resort is in horse country, yet convenient to both Gainesville and Ocala. We stayed here last June and came back for the winter. Now we are staying indefinitely and loving it. There is mature landscaping in the original part of the resort. New heated saline pool opened last February. They are expanding with 200 more sites set to open in the late summer. Great place for a short stay or long vacation. Friendly people! Month of Visit June Share Report Donni D. Traveler Reviewed Dec. 9, 2020 Business Getaway I have stayed at Ocala North a lot over the past couple of years when I go to Gainesville for business. A lot of changes have taken place during this time. They are expanding the number of spaces they currently have, the pool was being  resurfaced when I was there last. A new, larger dog park has added, shuffle board courts, bocci balls, pond with fountain light show and ducks. Not too far from society and shopping. At night I can see some stars. This is a very nice, friendly, resort, I enjoy staying here. Share Report Donni D. Traveler Reviewed May. 30, 2020 Enjoyable I have stayed here a few times. Very enjoyable and I always look forward to coming back. It's going through some renovations. New owners have paved all the spaces, the shower house has been redone, they are digging a beautiful pond in front. They have a little dog park, walking trails, off property is a nice bike ride, huge swimming pool, activities, laundry room and friendly people. At night the stars are amazing. Close to 1-75 and reasonable rates. This is a good place to stay. Share Report Showing results 1- 9 of 9 reviews For information regarding reservations, contact this campground directly.

The Ocala North RV Resort, spanning 73 acres in the heart of central Florida’s horse country, consists of 385 sites for RVs and cottages. Ocala is a pristine area known as having one of the most prolific equine industries in the world, with 600+ thoroughbred farms and training centers, as well as featuring Ocala National Forest, which has hundreds of lakes, rivers, and freshwater springs that serve as home to manatees and hundreds of other wildlife species. The region is an increasingly popular natural playground for RV enthusiasts and vacationers, with DLP Capital investing in the resort at a time when RVs are more popular than ever. More than 11.2 million households in the US own an RV, up 62 percent from 20 years ago, with a significant increase among 18- to 34-year-olds, who now make up nearly a quarter of the market.* DLP Capital’s acquisition of the RV resort follows on the heels of its development of Island Oaks RV Resort in north Florida near Jacksonville, which opened in 2022 and includes 385 RV pads. “RV resorts are an emerging asset class for investment. with tremendous untapped value given prolific growth in the RV leisure market,” said Don Wenner, Founder and CEO of DLP Capital. “America has changed the way it travels with the return of the road trip becoming increasingly popular, without the hassles of planes and trains. RV resorts are especially appealing to those interested in active outdoor getaways, and DLP Capital is refining the RV experience with amenity-driven resorts. It’s a new generation of RV resorts that are a far cry from prior generations of barebone parks.” Ocala is located approximately 20 miles south of Gainesville and 90 miles northwest of Orlando. The Ocala North RV Resort is easily accessible, featuring frontage along I-75 (exit 368), a major north-south interstate that connects the Southeast to the Great Lakes. The resort features a clubhouse, exercise center, saline swimming pool, pickleball, shuffleboard, and bocce ball courts, and Florida’s largest groomed dog park. DLP Capital will upgrade some amenities and may add more cottage accommodations. Plans also include development of a resort restaurant and general store and an outdoor community kitchen and fireplace. The resort also hosts special events and social activities throughout the year. More than 50 percent of the RV sites at the resort are “pull-throughs”—a highly desirable RV park feature, allowing easy maneuverability of recreational vehicles. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Ocala metro area is among the top 25 fastest-growing metro areas in the US. The Ocala region also features the largest equestrian complex in the US, the World Equestrian Center, with multi indoor/outdoor arenas hosting Olympic-caliber competitions. *RV Owner Demographic Profile Study, 2021 by Go Rving with Ipsos More about DLP Capital DLP Capital is a private real estate investment company focused on making an impact on four major crises in America: Affordable Housing, Jobs, Legacy and Happiness.

There's something for everybody here, including a duck pond with duck food if you choose to feed the ducks. The swimming pool & pool deck are the nicest I've seen in an RV campground at this price point. The ONLY thing I scored lower than 5 stars was the condition of the shower house near the back of the property. The people who clean it are supposedly there between 8:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m... but I always found them just starting to clean it at 10:00, which was very inconvenient for those of us needing to shower earlier in the morning so we could be dressed & ready for work or other scheduled commitments happening before noon. If I wanted to shower before 10:30 or 11:00 a.m., it was usually in a dirty shower room. Other than that, my husband said the exercise room has minimal equipment for anyone serious about working out. Even so, we both love this place enough to have already scheduled another month there next year. Read Less Helpful 3 Own this park?

We checked in to this RV campground and there were 4 employees in the office. None were wearing masks. They escort you to your campsite and that gentlemen was not wearing a mask either. The first campers we saw walked up to us from site 38 ( no masks) and told us the campground was having an outbreak of covid. Their neighbors at site 58 had been sick over 10 days. I overheard the woman in the site across from us describing her symptoms to another camper ( no mask) and then went to laundry in the public laundry. Bottom line- we did not go there to get sick and the campers with covid were not quarantined or wearing masks. We asked the management why we had not been told and they had no response.  We left early with no compensation to the days we had paid for.\r\nYou should also be aware that they are adding over 200 new campsites. Construction noises and beeping machinery starts at 7:30 am and ends at 6:00pm. Even on Christmas Eve- there was noise until 3pm.\r\nThey have removed so many trees you can hear I-75 traffic 24 hours a day.\r\nThe pool has been closed for construction fir several months.

The 6 month old workmanship is so flawed that the concrete pads are crumbling under medium size rigs and water pressure fails regularly with no communication from staff.  There are large cables running outside all over the road (a real hazard for us old folks) and the cable tv doesn't even work.  \r\n\r\nWe were thinking of coming back for another winter but with the clear cutting of trees, smoke & ash in the air from burning the tree debris, airboats trying to hide the smoke, the constant high speed heavy machinery running around, we found better accommodations for a better price.  This will be an \"express\" type of RV park (nothing resort about it) where you just roll thru for one night on their way to a real resort. \r\n\r\nThe new managements lipstick is already wearing off this quick flip \"investment opportunity\" Read Less Helpful 2 Own this park?

Also the bathrooms near our rig were closed the entire time for maintenance . The grounds were kept clean. However for two days we heard blowers  and lawn mowers from about 9 am and continuing most of the day.While we enjoyed our stay we will definitely not return here during the football season.

It's perfectly located between Ocala & Gainesville, close to several beautiful horse farms with easy access to I-75 & Hwy 441. The RV park is clean & beautiful with plenty of activities in which to participate (themed holiday parties & dances, card games & classes, shuffleboard, bocce ball, pickle ball, food trucks that come 5-6 days a week, Bible study, water aerobics, & line dance classes)....

There's something for everybody here, including a duck pond with duck food if you choose to feed the ducks. The swimming pool & pool deck are the nicest I've seen in an RV campground at this price point. The ONLY thing I scored lower than 5 stars was the condition of the shower house near the back of the property. The people who clean it are supposedly there between 8:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m... but I always found them just starting to clean it at 10:00, which was very inconvenient for those of us needing to shower earlier in the morning so we could be dressed & ready for work or other scheduled commitments happening before noon. If I wanted to shower before 10:30 or 11:00 a.m., it was usually in a dirty shower room. Other than that, my husband said the exercise room has minimal equipment for anyone serious about working out. Even so, we both love this place enough to have already scheduled another month there next year. Read Less Helpful 3 Own this park?

The first campers we saw walked up to us from site 38 ( no masks) and told us the campground was having an outbreak of covid. Their neighbors at site 58 had been sick over 10 days. I overheard the woman in the site across from us describing her symptoms to another camper ( no mask) and then went to laundry in the public laundry. Bottom line- we did not go there to get sick and the campers with covid were not quarantined or wearing masks. We asked the management why we had not been told and they had no response.  We left early with no compensation to the days we had paid for.\r\nYou should also be aware that they are adding over 200 new campsites. Construction noises and beeping machinery starts at 7:30 am and ends at 6:00pm. Even on Christmas Eve- there was noise until 3pm.\r\nThey have removed so many trees you can hear I-75 traffic 24 hours a day.\r\nThe pool has been closed for construction fir several months.

The 6 month old workmanship is so flawed that the concrete pads are crumbling under medium size rigs and water pressure fails regularly with no communication from staff.  There are large cables running outside all over the road (a real hazard for us old folks) and the cable tv doesn't even work.  \r\n\r\nWe were thinking of coming back for another winter but with the clear cutting of trees, smoke & ash in the air from burning the tree debris, airboats trying to hide the smoke, the constant high speed heavy machinery running around, we found better accommodations for a better price.  This will be an \"express\" type of RV park (nothing resort about it) where you just roll thru for one night on their way to a real resort. \r\n\r\nThe new managements lipstick is already wearing off this quick flip \"investment opportunity\" Read Less Helpful 2 Own this park?

Also the bathrooms near our rig were closed the entire time for maintenance . The grounds were kept clean. However for two days we heard blowers  and lawn mowers from about 9 am and continuing most of the day.While we enjoyed our stay we will definitely not return here during the football season.

Within just a 30 minute drive in any direction you have access to SO MANY fun places to see & do…from jaw-dropping world class horse farms, to quaint restaurants with outside seating, quirky antique stores, historical towns and historic landmarks…not to mention bats, elephants, butterflies and alligators! Let our staff members suggest their favorite places recommended to family and friends when they come to visit. Each location will show distance from Ocala North RV resort and the general direction, along with a link to their website for further information. You’ll DEFINITELY want to stay with us at the resort for a few days just to visit them all! HERE’S OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS… CEDAR LAKES & WOODS 23 minutes West in Williston. Expect to spend a couple hours exploring the top AND bottom of the quarry…it’s so interesting that the time will go by very quickly. You’ll definitely want to be sure your camera is charged for taking pictures! For more information CLICK HERE TWO TAILS RANCH 25 minutes West in Williston. This elephant preserve has been in the family for seven generations! Limited number of visitors so we recommend you call & reserve your place a couple days in advance. Great presentation on elephants. Other animals there to see. Very little walking involved. For more information CLICK HERE TWO HAWK HAMMOCK 22 minutes West in Williston. Every Sat 4p-8p is Happy Hour in the barnyard. Live music. ($5/person). Great for the entire family! Bring a lawn chair. Trapeze flights with Gainesville Circus Center. Lots of fun! For more information CLICK HERE DEVIL'S DEN 22 minutes West in Williston. Great place to snorkel or scuba dive. Expect to spend 1-2 hrs. They rent snorkel gear if you don’t have your own. Close to Two Tails, Two Hawk Hammock and Cedar Lakes & Woods. It can get pretty busy so we recommend you go early. Two hidden gems for food in Williston are Sister’s Cafe for lunch and Flamingo Freeze for dessert. CLICK HERE HISTORIC MICANOPY 12 minutes North. Fun short visit with antique shops, historic museum, and the Herlong Mansion. Our staff recommends having a light lunch (and most definitely dessert) at Coffee ‘n Cream right there in town. For more information on Historic Micanopy (pronounced mick-an-o’-pee) CLICK HERE PAYNES PRAIRIE STATE PARK 14 minutes North in Micanopy. Expect to spend about an hour unless you decide to hike some of the trails or picnic by the lake. Perfect for combining with Historic Micanopy. Paved trails to ranger station, washroom facilities, and 3-story tower overlooking Paynes Prairie. Bring field glasses with you as there’s a chance you’ll see wild horses and other animals roaming the prairies. For more information CLICK HERE LA CHUA TRAIL 28 minutes North in Gainesvile. While it’s a bit further to go it’s highly recommended. Rarely have we found this hidden gem busy, yet on a hot sunny day it’s THE best place to see alligators in their natural habitat lining the river banks. Summer rains may result in closing the walk beyond the boardwalk due to flood conditions. No dogs allowed and highly recommended small children are not left on their own. (top photo of alligators was taken at La Chua Trail) CLICK HERE DEPOT PARK 26 minutes North in Gainesvile. Perfect in combination with a trip to La Chua Trail and right next door to the Cade Museum. A fun place to take the kids for fun & arcade games but great for adults as well. Both food and liquor venues here with a nice outdoor open pavillion for eating. For more information CLICK HERE ANTIQUE EMPORIUM Only a 3 minute drive from the RV resort and open daily from 10am-6pm. You would have passed the Antique Emporium as you turned onto Hwy 225 after exiting I-75. Lots of fun things to see throughout the 17,000 square foot facility! For more information CLICK HERE ANTIQUE CITY MALL 9 minutes North in Micanopy. Good in combination with a trip to Historic Micanopy or Paynes Prairie State Park. If you enjoy antiques, you’ll find a wide vaiety of them and a great colection of items not normally found in your traditional antique store. For more information CLICK HERE ZIP THE CANYONS 15 minutes South in Ocala. If ziplining is your thing, then Zip the Canyons is a fantastic experience! Highlight is the Big Cliff Canyon taking you on an 1,100’ zip across Lost Spring Lake! You wouldn’t think you’d find quarry cliffs this high in Florida, but you’ll be amazed!
