While the exact cost will depend on the nature of the screening, we’re proud to provide pre-employment evaluations at a fair price for your requirement/market industry. From federal and local background checks to a variety of different drug testing options, we administer a multiple of evaluations to give you the peace of mind you need to make a great hire. bubble_chart I’m an employer looking to make a direct hire or temporary one. If you’re an employer looking to fill mostly leadership or administration roles, a direct hire may be the best way to go. It will give you access to a larger network of potential candidates and a talent pool that includes both passive and active job seekers. Alternatively, if you know a vacancy will only last for a short amount of time – e.g. annual leave, long service leave, maternity leave or preparing for a season of increased demand – a temp or temp-to-hire placement would be suitable. This allows you more time to evaluate a candidate to see if they are the right fit for your team before making a lasting commitment. bubble_chart I’m looking for an immediate start for a shift cover or temporary cover in my facility.
