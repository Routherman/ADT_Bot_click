Christopher Sciortino 3 min read · Jan 21, 2024 -- 1 Listen Share The Wet Whistle Co. is not a new coffee shop to me in the slightest. Since the beginning of my Sophomore year in college, The Wet Whistle Co. has been one of my all-time favorite places to study and crank out homework each and every time. From the staff to the themes, and of course, the coffee, another day at The Wet Whistle Co. has me ready for work and brings a comfortable feeling to settle down. For some context, I have always fancied the idea of visiting coffee shops and cafes since my Freshman year in college. The idea that I could unwind whether in a local establishment meant for some light-weighted work was always fascinating to me. Even the music was a core feature of cafes as I was always a fan of jazz music during my studies and coffee shops only made such music all the more enjoyable. Nonetheless, The Wet Whistle Co. leaves me to believe that this is the best coffee shop I could visit no matter the occasion. Press enter or click to view image in full size The Wet Whistle Co. Upon entering The Wet Whistle Co. I am greeted by one of their common themes as well as mascot, the skeleton. The Wet Whistle Co. gives off a unique theme of “life and death,” nothing too symbolic but something to think about nonetheless. Their walls alternate from green to purple, creating a very enchanting atmosphere with simple, yet stylish furniture to comfort their guests. Everywhere you look, The Wet Whistle Co. decorates its surroundings with unique liquor brands they wish to advertise to appropriate customers. I appreciate the aesthetic The Wet Whistle Co. offers and always find myself intrigued with how they present the layout of the store. As for The Wet Whistle Co.’s staff, they feature a lively group of people behind the counter always engaging in conversation. Their apparel is vibrant and casual, as well as complements the theme of their brand. Who I would assume is the manager for The Wet Whistle Co. is a very cheerful woman who does not seem to forget a face. Even after a full two months upon returning from the Winter Break, she recognized me and even remembered which university I belonged to in the area. I always feel very welcomed after interacting with any staff at The Wet Whistle Co. and am reminded of their constant hospitality as their staff checks up on their customers every once and a while. To save the best for last, today’s visit at The Wet Whistle Co. offers a variety of Valentine’s Day-themed beverages as well as their standard coffee brews. From coffees to teas to even milkshakes, The Wet Whistle Co. details its menu on three, colorful chalkboards that bring out some originality in their drinks. They even assort subtle pastries across the counter, grabbing the attention of hungry customers like myself and adding to the variety of their menu. Today I decided to give a shot to their Valentine’s Day menu and energize myself with some caffeine as I attend to some projects assigned to me for the week. In all, I will always appreciate how comforting it is to visit The Wet Whistle Co. and be greeted by their amazing staff. I look forward to many more opportunities that await me, potentially stumbling across a new menu theme every once in a while. However, what I look forward to the most is seeing that skeleton by the counter, enjoying a cup of coffee just like me. Who: A curious college student. Where: Archdale in downtown High Point, North Carolina. When: An early Saturday evening. What: Mr. Sandman (Honey and Vanilla Latte).
