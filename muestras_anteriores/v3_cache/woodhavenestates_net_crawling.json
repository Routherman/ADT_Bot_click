We help our clients to achieve breakthrough impact in their businesses, their teams and their lives. We believe that each of us possesses unique potential to learn, to create and to achieve lasting impact. We envision a world in which we all learn from one another to be thoughtful listeners and courageous leaders. Areas of Expertise Leadership & Career Development Transition Management Organizational Effectiveness Performance Management Strategic Planning & Organizational Development Business & Product Strategy Audience Research & Insights What We Do Individual Coaching Group Coaching Team Training & Facilitation Consulting Services Letter from the Founder To those leading others — and shaping what’s next: Years ago, I was leading a billion-dollar business at Microsoft. Our team was growing fast, managing global operations, scaling systems, and navigating constant change. It was high-impact, high-pressure work. What surprised me most wasn’t the complexity of the business — it was how often the real challenge was human. A reorg that created confusion. A talented manager in over their head. A strategic pivot that strained trust. Again and again, the moments that mattered most weren’t about KPIs. They were about people. That realization didn’t just shape how I led. It shaped why I eventually walked away — to help others lead differently. I started Woodhaven Advisors to create the kind of support I wish I’d had more of: a thought partner who understands the stakes, who’s been in the room, and who can help leaders navigate growth with clarity, confidence, and care. Today, Woodhaven Advisors works with executives, team managers, and HR leaders who are committed to building something meaningful. Sometimes that means 1:1 coaching. Sometimes it means designing a leadership development program or guiding an executive team through a strategic reset. Our clients range from startups to Fortune 100s. Across all of it, we bring experience leading at scale — and the coaching mindset needed to go deeper than surface solutions. In addition to advising companies across industries, I’ve spent over a decade designing award-winning leadership programs for mid-career professionals in product, tech, and business roles. My personal approach blends real-world credibility with an educator’s clarity — because skill-building should be both rigorous and practical. If you're leading people through growth, transition, or complexity, you're doing hard and important work. I’d be honored for Woodhaven to support you — and to help make your next chapter not just manageable, but transformative. Warmly, Adam Grupp Founder, Woodhaven Advisors Join Us!

It all started in 1963 when an eleven-year-old boy named Brad received a gift that would shape his future—a router. Overcome with excitement, young Brad hurried home to try his new power tool. But what began as joy quickly turned into shock as the router came to life with an unexpected jolt. Determined to master it, Brad mounted the router in a table, taming its wild nature and sparking a lifelong passion for woodworking. Fast forward to 1983, Brad turned that passion into Woodhaven—a woodworking haven offering tools, classes, and DIY experiences. It didn’t take long for customers to request their own router tables, and Brad happily began making them. Before long, Woodhaven transitioned into a full-fledged manufacturer of innovative woodworking tools and accessories. In 2021, Brad passed the torch, retiring after decades of dedication to the craft. Today, we continue to honor his legacy by offering superior products and pushing the boundaries of what woodworking tools can do. At Woodhaven, we don’t just sell tools; we empower creativity and precision. We’re deeply committed to listening to our customers, because your ideas inspire us to innovate and grow. Got a suggestion or an idea for a tool you'd like to see? Reach out—we’d love to hear from you. Thank you for being a part of the Woodhaven journey. Here’s to making sawdust and memories! Doug Fett - Woodhaven, LLC Guarantee: All items we manufacture have a lifetime guarantee against defects in materials or workmanship to the original owner. Items we don't manufacture are covered by the manufacturers warranty.
