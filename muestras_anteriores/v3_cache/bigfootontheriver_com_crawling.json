This was our family first rafting adventure and so glad we went with Bigfoot! The staff was so knowledgable of the area and the water was so clean and fun to get right in! It was so nice to see the native Americans also working on the river to preserve its natural and pristine quality. I would definitely do this again. Dannielle F. Tripadvisor Super fun trip. It was our first time rafting and we had a blast. I chose this company because it had good reviews and it was right next door to the cottages we were staying in. Our guide was awesome. Sam was so nice and made us feel at ease. We felt safe with him. We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this company. Tommy L. Tripadvisor This was a first time for some and a repeat for others, and everyone had an amazing experience. Our guide, Alex, made sure that all 7 of us(regardless of skill level) thoroughly enjoyed our trip. Great rapids with plenty of down time in between for swimming and cliff jumping. Wow, can't rate it high enough. Thank you Alex- hope your arm is okay! See you next time. Lawrence B.

When I was a kid, I remember going through a massive phase where all I wanted to talk about was the Loch Ness monster. My teacher had read the class a book about Nessie and I was hooked. Looking back, it's clear (at least for me) that this giant sea creature doesn't actually exist and is just a fun legend. So, I'm not normally one to believe in the existence of these strange beings, but one video that was taken in Colorado definitely peaked my interest. Get our free mobile app Viral Video Claims to Show Bigfoot in Colorado I was scrolling through social media the other night, when I came across a video that had me make a double take. An Instagram account called @_colorado_river_expeditions_ posted the video online and it is blowing up on social media. Where Was the Bigfoot Video Filmed? According to a report from the Daily Mail , the video was taken along the Upper Colorado River on May 24th. About a dozen people were whitewater rafting with the Colorado River Expedition when they decided to pull over to have lunch. One of the people in the group pulled out their phone and captured a brief video of something strange in the woods. A hairy, and pretty tall figure appeared to be lurking around between the trees. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Colorado River Expeditions (@_colorado_river_expeditions_) In the clip, it seems to be walking on two legs. It's unclear if the figure actually saw the travelers or not. However, from the brief clip that was recorded, whatever this thing is seems pretty harmless. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Colorado River Expeditions (@_colorado_river_expeditions_) What People Are Saying About the Colorado Bigfoot Sighting Logan Kirk , one of the guides on this trip confirmed in a report that the crew was about 500 yards away from the creature. At first glance, this looks like something right out of a Sci-Fi movie like 'Rise of the Planet Apes.' The witnesses who captured the video and saw this creature in person are confident that it's Bigfoot. Staff from Colorado River Expeditions say they are going to go back out to that area soon and see if they can find this creature again.
