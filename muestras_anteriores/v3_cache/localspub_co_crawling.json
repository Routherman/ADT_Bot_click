      "text": "Who we are - The Pub People Company We are excited to announce the re-opening of the Hand & Heart in Nottingham following a major refurbishment! We are proud to announce the completion of the £1.6m refurbishment of The Dukeries Lodge in Edwinstowe We have completed the acquisition of our latest freehold - the Cross Keys in Belper - significant investment to follow Work with us Application Form Run your own pub Operations & Support Training Pub Vacancies Who we are ESG Investments in our pubs Who we work with Our Pubs Selling Your Pub Get in touch Giving Feedback Work with us Application Form Run your own pub Operations & Support Training Pub Vacancies Who we are ESG Investments in our pubs Who we work with Our Pubs Selling Your Pub Get in touch Giving Feedback The Pub People Company owns and operates pubs in the East Midlands The Pub People Company have been operating pubs in the East Midlands since 1993. All of our pubs are run by people who are self employed and want the support of a head office and business development function. Our pubs are established and are well invested to compete effectively in their local markets. Where we can, local microbrewers and food suppliers are used extensively. We have pubs in city centres, canal side locations but most often in local communities and neighbourhoods Pub People was Established over 30 years Ago The Company was formed in 1993, changing its name to Pub People in 1999. Initially the business focused on temporary holding contracts. This developed into permanent leases, some of which were then purchased as freeholds. Significantly, the originators invested into the Company infrastructure which enabled the growth to be steady and controlled, taking advantage of opportunities but also able to weather harder times such as the smoking ban, the financial crisis of 2008 and more recently COVID 19. Since the pandemic the ownership of Pub People has changed with the private equity firm, Downing, buying a majority share. This has resulted in a rapid growth phase as a number of new freehold pubs have been identified for acquisition and further investment is earmarked to exploit potential within the existing estate. Our Values Safe and friendly We are passionately committed to providing a safe and friendly work place for all head office and pub based staff, where they feel challenged but empowered to “do the right thing” for the Company. We would like all our customers to experience a safe, friendly and time in our pubs enjoying consistently high quality food and drink at a fair price,  in surroundings that are maintained to the best standards. Our suppliers In terms of our suppliers, we value them highly and want to develop long term sustainable relationships based upon a negotiated price – quality – service ratio Optimize profit Our business ethos seeks to optimize profit and manage finances professionally and accurately alongside compliance with the law at all levels Whilst sometimes we don't get it right, it is very important to us that our customers, our staff and our suppliers are treated in a courteous and friendly manner in every situation. Like many things we were told along time ago, the old adage “the customer is always right” rings hollow today. The relationship between the pub staff, customers and others who come into contact with the pub from time to time can be very fluid and fast moving. Whilst It is important that difficult and volatile situations are handled with care and sensitivity.

It’s unfortunate that many owners regard pubs primarily as property assets which are more valuable if their use can be changed to something else like a house or shop. However, all across the country, communities are fighting back. Sometimes effective campaigning is sufficient to see off an unwanted planning application. In some cases, though, the best way forward for local people has been to buy the pub themselves. As of April 2025, 217 pubs are community-owned with another 28 community-run and some 78 active campaigns under way . Needless to say, as champions of Britain’s pub-goers, CAMRA is hugely in favour of these developments and we are keen to help communities interested in going down this road. We are, though, far from being the only body which can assist.  Please download Community Owned Pubs – A CAMRA Guide for information about other sources of advice and, in some cases, funding. A remarkable statistic around community owned pubs is that, to date, they have a 100% success rate. A few have been sold on to the private sector once the business was re-established but all the rest have survived and thrived. The reasons aren't, perhaps, hard to understand. People in the community with a direct stake in the business will obviously support it and encourage others to do so. More importantly, the whole community will see the pub as 'theirs' which generates levels of loyalty and commitment that other operating models can only dream of. Also, most businesses own the freehold of the pub outright so their outgoings during periods of restriction, like the recent one, are manageable compared with others. Simply put, this is a model that works. News The Radnor Arms, New Radnor, Powys reopened on 20/4/25. The Radnor Arms CBS bought the semi-derelict pub in 2022 and renovated the building with help from a Community Ownership Fund grant.More at facebook.com/radnorarmscbs With support from South of Scotland Enterprise, the Wigtown Community Inn CBS was able to purchase the Plough Inn, closed since 2022. It reopened as the Wigtown Ploughman on 28/3/25. More at www.wigtown-cbs.co.uk The Unicorn Inn, Bayford near Wincanton closed in April 2024. A CBS was formed and secured the premises at auction. Refurbishment is underway and the pub will reopen soon as the Bayford Inn, See www.bayfordinn.com In Whorlton, near Barnard Castle, Co.Durham, a group of residents is forming a CBS with the objective of buying the Bridge Inn, closed since 2021.

Crackers to break ground with fresher approach Previous Next Posted Thursday, September 28, 2023 12:04 pm By Lee Wardlaw lee@claytodayonline.com Brad Skwirsk purchased and remodeled the original Cheers on Wells Road in 2011, rebranding the Orange Park-based bar to Locals Pub. Now, he will seek to redesign another Clay County bar: Crackers Lounge & Package. The bar will keep the same name and atmosphere, continuing the tradition. But this time, it will offer a modern and more pleasing atmosphere. The walling is being completed, and liquor is on display, which used to be hidden in cabinets underneath during the bar’s former ownership. Soon, these tables and chairs will be replaced. Owner Brad Skwirsk is making an upgrade to new furniture. Just for that portion of the budget, the owner has spent $20,000. ORANGE PARK—Crackers Lounge and Package developed a rustic charm after serving Orange Park residents cold beer, live music and rowdy fun for more than 20 years. Brad Skwirsk was handed the keys to the bar on Aug. 1, and the new owner began renovations the next day, determined to give Crackers the facelift it needs to continue being a welcoming locale in Clay County. “It wasn’t bad, but it could be vastly improved, renovated and cleaned up,” he said. Initially opened for business where G’s Slow Cooked BBQ now stands, Crackers has found a home at its current location at 1241 Blanding Blvd. By Aug. 3, improvements were already noticeable. “We began by giving the place a thorough cleaning. The floors, the paint, the walls, everything,” he said. The brooding, dark paint was traded for a lighter, fresher color. This wasn’t Skwirsk’s first rodeo, either. His first “bar-flipping” enterprise was when he purchased Cheers in 2012. Skwirsk renovated, rebranded and turned the bar around, now known as Locals. Skwirsk intends to reinvigorate what makes Crackers beloved in the community. It will keep the same sign out front and the vintage cigarette machine by the front door. No smoking will be allowed inside, but will continue to be accommodated outside. Skwirsk wants to vitalize the so-called “hole in the wall” as an entertainment hub for the area. The goal is to keep the tradition alive with a modern touch. As progress is being made, a large conglomerate of cars has started to fill the parking line outside the Town Center, and that number grows daily. Business throughout the shopping center is booming. Skwirsk believes that Harbor Freight, the retail hardware store next door, could bring even more customers through the doors. When Skwirsk makes a purchase, he does so by betting on trends in the area and with a blueprint already in his mind. For Crackers, he saw a major county roadway between two towns surrounded by neatly planned suburbs that never seemed to quit growing. Skwirsk understood the community lacked a centralized, high-quality, clean nightlife attraction. “We want to be the go-to spot for a relaxing evening out. After 6 p.m., there’s not much happening south of here towards Middleburg. We aim to fill that void by providing a welcoming space to enjoy cocktails, beer, watch their favorite live sports or entertainment and socialize with their friends. We’re here for someone that wants to forget their problems and come inside to relax,” he said. A lack of significant competition in a two-mile radius made his “gamble” a no-brainer. The ongoing renovations at Crackers encompass a complete overhaul of the interior. Workers assemble a dazzling feature wall to showcase an immense, neatly displayed, high-class liquor selection with cabinetry. Crackers is working tirelessly to be ready for football season. Six 75-inch flat-screen TVs will be installed by the end of this week, and 10 more will be added by next year. “ “I just ordered $20,000 worth of furniture,” Skwirsk said. That investment entails new booths, barstools and antique-style tables. A refurbished stage will rekindle a passion for live music and an age-old tradition at Crackers – open mic night. On stage, local bands can practice and perform unreleased music. Perhaps the next Clay County musical sensation, a modern-day Lynyrd Skynyrd, will emerge from the establishment. Progress is being made every day, and renovations are hoped to be wrapped up in the next six to eight months. Once customers walk inside, Skwirsk envisions an experience they’ve never seen before. “When they walk through that door, I want them to say, ‘This isn’t the same place I remember from five or 10 years ago.’ It was not bad before, but I believe there will be a ‘wow’ factor about this place. It’s going to be special,” he said. The previous owner wanted him to continue the tradition and Skwirsk intends to, but he also sees an opportunity for growth. “I want to continue where she left off, but I want to make it better. Locals is thriving. I (believe) I can do this one more time,” he said.
