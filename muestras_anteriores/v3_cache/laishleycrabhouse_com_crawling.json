Now that view of Charlotte Harbor belongs to all who care to stroll through the well-manicured Laishley Park, motor up to the marina or dine at the recentlyopened Laishley Crab House, a sprawling restaurant and bar situated almost at the water’s edge. The new restaurant is yet another holding of Smuggler Enterprises, which also owns and operates Harpoon Harry’s and Captain’s Table at Fisherman’s Village. I suspect it will become a draw for boaters as well as those who love a water view with their crabs. Laishley Crab House has something for everyone — crab by the bucket, in cakes, salads and soft shells, along with sandwiches and salads, plus a full bar and even a cozy sushi bar tucked into a relatively quiet corner of the dining room. There’s a reasonably priced wine list, with two dozen varieties available by the glass. COURTESY PHOTO Above: Laishley Crab House Left: Custom woodwork inside the bar at Laishley Crab House Besides the large dining room there’s another room that can serve as extra dining space or as a banquet facility, plus a good-sized deck for al fresco dining that offers a prime view of the harbor. Although it’s too early for me to review it — the grand opening was Aug. 15 — I stopped by Sunday night to check things out. There were lots of people in the bar, which boasts rough-cut wood columns with carved critters atop them. A gigantic crab sculpture hangs from the high ceiling over the bar. The dining room also has a woodsy feel, with crab traps and other marine paraphernalia posted here and there. The crab house is at 150 Laishley Court in Punta Gorda. It’s open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday. Call 205-5566. Post-storm recipes sought As Pies and Plates owner Cindee Murphy prepared for a cooking demonstration at the recent Xtreme Makeover celebration commemorating the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Charley, inspiration struck. KAREN FELDMAN / FLORIDA WEEKLY Emmett Todd demonstrates how to cook ribs during the most recent session of his Backyard BBQ School at Lakes Park in Fort Myers. “People kept telling us what they made when they had no power, how they have a great recipe on a scrap of paper somewhere that they’d used during Charley. I realized there’s a great wealth of information we’ve gained as a community and we don’t want to lose it.” The result: She began a collection called “Recipes We Hope We Never HAVE to Use.” The name aside, Ms. Murphy believes the recipes for dishes made without electricity could be useful to boaters and campers even when disaster doesn’t strike. “We’re encouraging the whole community to contribute and we’re hoping to come up with a great collection of recipes,” she says. She’s set up her Web site so that it’s easy to enter the recipes online. Go to www.piesandplates.com , click on the recipe link, then click on the Hurricane Charley Recipe Collection Project. There’s a form there on which you can enter recipes. Ms. Murphy is also looking for recollections about what it was like to cook after to the storm, what happened to people’s kitchens and any lessons learned. Pies and Plates is at 2310 Tamiami Trail, Punta Gorda. Call 505-7437. A complete list of upcoming culinary academy classes as well as hours, directions, recipes and the restaurant’s menu can be found on the Web site. Food that comes to you Too busy to run out and pick up lunch? Too pooped to cook after a busy work day? If you live or work in Punta Gorda, Up the Street Gourmet has a tasty solution: Check out the menu, place your order online and a made-to-order meal will arrive on your doorstep. Up the Street is the brainchild of Linda Albanese and Ron Cocchi. The concept was born of their own need. “The idea came from being stranded here without a car and finding out there was no dinner deliver, with the exception of pizza,” Ms. Albanese says. “That’s not right. So we decided to create a delivery service that wasn’t pizza and wasn’t the same old sandwich.” She’s been in the restaurant business in some capacity since she was 12 years old, she says. The couple ran a restaurant on the New Jersey shore for a season and decided they enjoyed it enough to give it a try in Punta Gorda. A delivery business is the first step. “This is a compromise to get our feet wet in the area,” she says. “With the current economy, it didn’t seem the right time for a full-service restaurant.” That may come later. In the meantime, Up the Street has a few tables for those who want to get out of the office for lunch, but most of their business involves delivering food to offices or homes. The free delivery area encompasses Punta Gorda south to Burnt Store Isles and throughout Punta Gorda Isles. Lunch fare includes panini, hot dogs, muffaletas, sandwiches, salads, soups and chili. Prices run $3-$7. All the lunch items are available for dinner as well as various Italian fare, inspired by their annual trips to Italy. Choices include Tuscan roast shoulder of pork, steak pizzaiola and various pasta dishes that run $9-$11. The menu features “everything we like and that we want to share with other people,” Ms. Albanese says. “The food is very simple, everything is made fresh. I even make my own dressings. Everything made to order. We don’t even pre-slice cold cuts. It might take a little longer, but everything is done with highest quality and best intention. We want to really stand out.” Lunch is available 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays. Dinner is available 4 to 7:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Up the Street is at 329 E. Virginia Ave. in Punta Gorda. Call 639-2223 or visit online at www.upthestreettogo.com . Cooking expo set for Saturday The Summertime-Sizzle Food and Cooking Expo is set for 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 29, at the Charlotte Harbor Event and Conference Center. There will be lots of food and drink, a variety of cooking classes and demonstrations of a culinary nature. Call 639- 5833 for details. Grilling maestro gets people fired up about barbecue By day, Emmett Todd delivers packages for UPS around Fort Myers Beach. On weekends, he changes hats and becomes the guru of the grill, delivering lessons aimed at helping others become barbecue masters in their own right. Mr. Todd, with an assist from his wife, Jessica, teaches Backyard BBQ School. “I love the topic,” he says. “It’s my passion.” He holds class once a month at Lakes Park in south Fort Myers. Over five hours, students learn about tools and fuels and how to use them, the history and regional influences of barbecue, cuts of meat, basic sauces and rubs and proper cooking techniques. The day culminates with what Mr. Todd calls the “Q de gras” — a feast featuring the ribs and mojo chicken cooked during the class as well as traditional fixings, such as potato salad, cole slaw and baked beans. “We stuff you full of barbecue,” he says. According to Mr. Todd, his journey into barbecue mastery began by “suffering and humiliating myself and my family.” After a lot of trial and error, he started to get the hang of it, then attended a class. As he sat there, it occurred to him that he could do it better and offer people a less expensive cooker than those being sold there for upwards of $3,000. And so began Backyard BBQ School, which has been running since January 2008. The cost of the class is $65, including lunch. If they choose, students can also order custom-made barbecue pits, which Mr. Todd will create and install for about $1,000 each. Or, if you want him to do the cooking, too, he’s also a licensed caterer and can provide a grilled feast for up to 200 people. “There’s a special interaction, an intimacy involved when you have people sitting down and sharing a meal, especially if they can relate while cooking, too,” he says. “I believe it’s God given. It makes us feel a little better, makes problems go away for a while. I think it’s awesome. I’d like to see more people slow down, tend a fire and eat some barbecue.” The next class is Saturday, Sept. 26, and is limited to 16 participants.

THE SUSHI BAR AT LAISHLEY CRAB HOUSE Sun Choe - Sushi Chef at Laishley Crab House Sun Choe was born in South Korea and came to Honolulu at the age of eleven. His first job was at Sato’s Japanese Restaurant in Waikiki, where he worked for five years, learning and gaining more responsibility during that time. In 1985, Sun moved to California and became assistant sushi chef at Hoban Korean-Japanese Restaurant. He then went to Miami and took a job as assistant manager and chef at the Samurai Japanese Restaurant. One of the tasks he enjoyed about this job was his interaction with the customers, talking with them and making sure they were happy with both their dine-in and take-out food. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew forced Sun to find another job. He was fortunate to work at Sushin Japanese Restaurant, whose owner had opened Miami’s first sushi restaurant back in 1979. From him, Sun learned the passion behind making beautiful and delicious fresh sushi. “When you are passionate about your job, it takes you to higher ground again and again,” says Sun. He takes great pleasure in preparing the finest sushi for guests to enjoy. To contact Sun Choe – Sushi Chef at Laishley Crab House , please email sun@smugglers.com .
