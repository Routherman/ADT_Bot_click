Marketing strategies are targeted to encourage leisure and business travel, including individuals, families, group tours, meetings and conferences, weddings, reunions, sports competitions, special events and film projects. The Bureau's efforts generate revenue for resorts, hotels, condominiums and home rentals, as well as restaurants, retailers, attractions, recreational activities and supporting service companies. Marketing & Communications The Visitor & Convention Bureau's marketing efforts are designed to build top-of-mind awareness for the destination, develop a strong brand identity for the area, and create a unified presence in the marketplace through marketing initiatives that target specific travelers through multiple online and offline opportunities. Some of the marketing department's strategies include quarterly and annual research studies, production for an annual Visitor Guide and all sales collateral and brochures to support our activities. We also are responsible for developing and implementing the annual media plan that includes digital and print advertising for multiple audiences. We manage the websites and support functions, manage the customer relationship management (CRM) system, and manage all email communications to Partners and the public audiences. Sports & Events The Bureau's focus on sports utilizes sports as a vehicle to diversify Charlotte County's tourism appeal on a year-round basis. A number of high-quality sporting venues, combined with a picturesque natural destination and warm hospitality, allow the VCB to attract state, regional, national and international sporting events which contribute significantly to increased economic impact. Meetings & Conventions Professional sales staff promotes the Punta/Gorda/Englewood Beach, the Charlotte Harbor Gulf Island Coast as a group travel destination to consumers, travel agents, tour operators and small meeting and conference planners. The Bureau also participates in a series of carefully selected travel, trade, and consumer shows in key markets to meet with travel agents, tour operators, event organizers and meeting planners who sell the destination. Public Relations The public relations effort is designed to facilitate media awareness by building and strengthening relationships with travel editors, writers and other journalistic resources. The resulting articles and editorial coverage by travel media featuring Charlotte County's tourism opportunities provide exposure which the Bureau's advertising budget cannot otherwise support. The value of this publicity is further enhanced by professional travel writers' validations of Punta Gorda/Englewood Beach as a premier vacation destination. Film Development The Film staff promotes Charlotte County as a filming location by responding to leads and developing relationships with location scouts in the production industry. Film projects generate significant expenditures and destination awareness. The Bureau works to attract projects within the industry that include films, television, commercials, documentaries, catalog shoots, music videos and digital media/interactive entertainment. Advocacy By showcasing the natural beauty and vibrant community of Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, and Englewood Beach, the VCB helps shape a positive perception of our county. When people think of Florida’s Gulf Coast, they think of welcoming local businesses, the beautiful surroundings, and the hospitality that makes Charlotte County a destination of choice.
