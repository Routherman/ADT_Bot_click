People of Action We are proud to be a part of Rotary International. Over 1.2 million members worldwide share a common passion for Service Above Self. At weekly meetings, members catch up with friends, hear what’s happening in our communities, and share plans and exchange ideas for creating lasting change. A connection with Rotary gives members the chance to develop skills like public speaking, project management, and event planning. Rotarians meet interesting people from the community and around the world. We tackle local and international issues that are important to our fellow club members. We provide service opportunities, social events, and work together to make Nashville a stronger community. Since it’s founding, the Rotary Club of Nashville has hosted prominent speakers and engaging weekly programs. We are honored the Governor, the Mayor, and other leaders choose our venue to present their views on current issues. History The Rotary Club of Nashville was organized on November 19, 1913, when thirteen businessmen gathered at the office of James A. Cayce, President of B. H. Steif Jewelry Company. Charter Number 94 was granted to the Club on February 1, 1914. Today, more than 35,000 clubs comprise Rotary International with over 1,200,000 members in 200 geographical regions of the world. The Rotary Club of Nashville has proudly furnished one Rotary International President, Will R. Manier, and ten District Governors. Nashville Rotary Service Trust Since 1914, members of the Rotary Club of Nashville have shared a proud tradition of providing organized community service for those in need. Through the Nashville Rotary Service Trust, our members provide financial support and volunteer service to ensure the continued success of our humanitarian efforts. This member commitment is what makes Rotary unique.
