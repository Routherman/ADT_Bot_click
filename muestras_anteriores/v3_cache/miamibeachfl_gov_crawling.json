Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover lifestyle, art, and interior design. Follow Author Mar 16, 2021, 03:04pm EDT Apr 05, 2024, 06:19pm EDT Share Save Comment This article is more than 4 years old. The first recorded homes are relics of our human survival within nature. Structures born from necessity, Darwinian—if you will—in that the strongest ones kept us alive. If you take the romance we’ve placed on homes today out of the equation, perhaps not much has changed. For most of us, our homes still act as a disconnect from the natural world, separating us by inches of masonry or concrete or brick. Richard Christiansen, however, is not most of us. Christiansen has turned many-a-dream into reality. He’s founder of the renowned Chandelier Creative agency. He’s owner of the locally treasured art bookstore Owl Bureau . He took his roots growing up on a farm in the Australian Outback and brought them to the top of a hill in Los Angeles, where he has designed his home as an ode and connection to nature. Today, he’s turned his artful eye onto the worlds of vegetables and and other earthly pleasures as founder of Flamingo Estate . What started as a passion for growing and harvesting his seven-acre garden, has turned into a pandemic success story and brand of homemade bath and body products, tinctures, candles, fresh flowers, honey, oils, produce, bread, hand sanitizer and more that he plans to put in everyone’s homes. Richard Christiansen Courtesy of Flamingo Estate As I sat down to talk to Christiansen I’d imagined a story about a garden. Rather, what I got was a story about love, pleasure, and yes, psilocybin too. A story about how he’s created Flamingo Estate to bring natural treats back into our lives. Here, he gives insight on how we could all nurture our relationship with nature right at home. Natalie Stoclet: Let’s start with the Estate itself, what drew you to it? Richard Christiansen: The house has a really interesting history. It was this hedonistic playground on the top of a hill. Back in the 40s and 50s it was a porn studio—that part is easy to joke about but it was so much more than that. It was about sexual freedom, a lot of musicians and artists came here, legend has it that party’s here would go on for days. Back then the studios were not in Hollywood they were in Highland Park, and this was an escape up the hill for a lot of people who wanted a quiet enclave to have some mischief. When I started to understand it’s history I wanted to bring a lot of its former glory back. I spent years thinking about the house and planting the garden. Flamingo Estate Courtesy of Flamingo Estate MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor NS: How do you design a house in connection to nature? Richard: I designed the house with a company called Studio KO in Paris. We travelled to Morocco and Japan and around Europe. In Morocco, I loved that they made the garden the biggest room of the house. We’ve done that here but have also brought the garden inside. If you close your eyes and walk through the house, your fingertips will feel a lot of different things that are quite sensual. It’s different textures of raw stone, it’s a lot of wood. Even though you’re not in the garden you can walk around my house and feel as if you are in the garden. People get distracted by the way a house looks. It’s more interesting to think about the way a house feels. NS: When did your home turn into the Flamingo Estate brand? Richard: A year ago this week, my friend’s farm in LA was about to go bankrupt. All of her vegetables went to restaurants and hotels which halted because of the pandemic. My parents lost their farm when I was a kid so I knew really well what that would feel like. I was not going to let that happen. I told her that we’d try to sell her vegetables at Owl Bureau, my art bookstore. That very first Friday, we sold 400 boxes. The next Friday we sold 800. And then through various interesting adventures we now have 35 drivers delivering vegetables boxes around the city. We’ve accumulated all sorts of farmers. That’s how Flamingo Estate as a brand started. Vegetable Boxes by Flamingo Estate Courtesy of Flamingo Estate. NS: What did it mean to brand nature and vegetables? Richard: Before Flamingo Estate, I had all the excuses in the world why I hadn’t yet created a garden brand like I’d always wanted. Not enough time, not enough money, not enough people. Decades ago I founded a creative agency, Chandelier Creative, and all of a sudden because of the pandemic, all of the clients we spent 20 years courting and getting to know fell away. I had dozens and dozens of employees who now had nothing to do. Copywriters became in charge of stone fruit management. Art Directors started working on lettuce. It created another outlet for a big group of people who otherwise would have been furloughed. It was interesting to have a bunch of very fashion-forward art directors turn their attention to vegetables. We said that Flamingo Estate was going to be the Hermès of vegetables. NS: Beyond produce, how did you start creating Flamingo Estate products from your garden? Richard: I started making my own shampoo and body wash because my water at the estate ran directly into the garden. I didn’t want my bath water killing my plants. For the first time I realized that some of my favorite brands were full of chemicals. How was I rubbing products on my skin that were unhealthy for my plants? Long before I ever thought we’d start selling products we made them because we cared about my garden. Now my body wash is full of essential oils. The intention was not to start a brand, it was to save my trees. It’s just so funny how it all started. Bath Products by Flamingo Estate Courtesy of Flamingo Estate NS: Where did you learn how to cultivate a garden? Richard: I knew about gardening from growing up on my parent’s farm. But really I’ve just met some wonderful people along the way who gave me their knowledge. An amazing french landscape architect, Arnaud Casaus, did the original master plan for the Flamingo Estate garden. I also have a full-time horticulturist, Jeff Hutchison, as well as a few people who work under him. I just started to have a collection of people around me who are as passionate about nature as I am. NS: What was the first thing you planted when you got the Estate? Richard: My mom and I planted little spigots of rosemary all over a slope. Now it’s a sea of rosemary down one side of the hill. We also planted a mango tree together on my first Christmas here not long after I bought this place. Now it’s my official Christmas tree. I think about my parents and Christmas every time I see it sprouting another mango. NS: How many varieties of plants do you have now? Richard: Hundreds. Really. We have hundreds. The garden is seven acres. If people come here I say the only gift I ever want is something I can plant, or a record I can play. Many of my friends will come here with a plant or a tree and it makes me so happy because I can walk around the garden and be surrounded by my friends even when they’re not here. Flamingo Estate Garden Courtesy of Flamingo Estate. NS: How can those who don’t have a garden integrate nature into their homes? Richard: Bringing nature inside in any way possible is what keeps my heart racing. Everyone who lives in New York for example has lots of indoor plants, but it’s also about considering how nature touches your senses. It’s about bringing nature in for smell and sight and touch and taste. Consider candles, essential oils, bath products, natural materials and colors. NS: What effect do you think bringing nature inside has on our overall well being? Richard: There’s a lot of healing that can be felt in nature. I often say that mother nature is our best friend and our therapist and our doctor. And it’s really true. It also doesn’t require a seven acre garden to do that. It requires a really good hot bath, or a hot shower, and some great essential oils. This past year has made people anxious. People are looking inwards, asking all the right questions, but I think the next frontier is how do we heal with nature. I’m very excited about psilocybin and magic mushrooms. As we keep speaking of pleasure from the garden as our North Star, when laws change we definitely want to jump into magic mushrooms. Candles by Flamingo Estate Courtesy of Flamingo Estate NS: What resources can we give people who want to create their own earthly paradise? Richard: There are so many good books. One of my favorite books is by Ilse Crawford, she’s one of my heroes. She pioneered the movement around making a home feel special and not just look special. Her book Home is Where The Heart Is , is an amazing resource for how to make small changes to any space, even if you’re in a tiny apartment in New York, that makes it feel more warm and loving. It’s probably my favorite book. NS: What does it mean to brand your home and to live within that brand? Richard: I think anyone whose home feels like a thing of beauty, has probably guarded their choices closely. The first thing is just that edit. I got very diligent in making choices about who I spend my time with, the food we cook, the music we listen to. The fundamental things that bring you pleasure. Pleasure is a human right, and we have become distanced from that. I have created this beautiful garden that I’ve spent years building and I really just wanted to share that with people. I can’t think of anything I’d rather do. Flamingo Estate Courtesy of Flamingo Estate. NS: What’s growing next for Flamingo Estate? Richard: We have a whole bunch of new products coming out. We’re going to expand our vegetable delivery to New York this year. We’re meeting different farmers and growers in new cities as we start to really pull that web together. It’s about connecting these people who grow and make and harvest under one banner that supports what they’re doing but also has a really clear code of conduct and quality. It gives them another financial platform. Mostly, using all that goodness to cook nice meals and take baths and all that good stuff. Things that are fundamental human pleasures.

And then imagine that very same family business is Flamingo Land. ‌ That is exactly what happened to Gordon Gibb, and more than two decades later, the major Yorkshire tourist attraction has gone from strength to strength. ‌ Speaking about his arrival into the Flamingo Land business , Mr Gibb said: “It was a really complex time looking back at the start of my career. “Aside from the personal tragedy of losing my best friend, mentor and father, his right-hand man of 30 years died 18 months later at the age of 49. Gordon Gibb, CEO at Flamingo Land ‌ “The loss to the business was immense, but you can't feel sorry for yourself. “If I'm honest, fear of failure was the strongest motivation, and although we have achieved success along the way, surviving was our first objective.” Flamingo Land was founded by Mr Gibb’s father in 1977. ‌ READ MORE: Cruel Flamingo Land fraudster conned holidaymakers out of hundreds with 'caravan to rent' Originally called Flamingo Park, the founder bought the company from his employer and changed the name before his death in 1995. Then-18-year-old Gordon Gibb was well and truly thrown in at the deep end but, fast forward to today, and Flamingo Land employs 500 people, turns over £37m and attracts 1.5 million visitors a year. Mr Gibb took the reins at Flamingo Land when he was just 18 ‌ Mr Gibb said: “The biggest challenge over the last two decades has been developing and growing the business without borrowing. “This was particularly difficult when the economic environment is challenging, but we have managed to deliver a new project every year for our customers as well as breaking some records on the journey, like our record breaking roller coaster, the steepest coaster in the world.” Mr Gibb has five children – aged between 18 months and 13 – who are enjoying growing up in and around Flamingo Land and its animals. ‌ READ MORE: Terrible Tudors and Awful Egyptians are heading to Hull with Horrible Histories Conservation is a central part of the work Flamingo Land does. Mr Gibb said if it is impossible to properly recreate an animal’s natural habitat, then it is not kept at the park. Speaking about his children and their futures, the owner said: “Our five children are all too young to consider what career paths their lives may take. More than a million people visit Flamingo Land every year ‌ “All that we want is for them to find their passion. Animal conservation is my passion and I would hope that one of the children carry on my work in this field, but we would never force it on to them.” READ MORE: How Hull's big attractions helped Yorkshire claim top tourism spot in 2017 Flamingo Land continues to attract more than one million visitors every year, and is a popular destination for families across East Yorkshire. Mr Gibb said the park had “carved a niche out for itself.” ‌ Hull Daily Mail Icon Family news Hull kids absolutely owned Halloween New kids role play centre Magical Santa train Mums already done Christmas shopping He said: “Flamingo Land is unique in that we combine an animal collection, a theme park and a holiday resort within one operation. “We have carved a niche out for ourselves and have become known for amazing hospitality food and beverage as well as fantastic attractions. ‌ “This is why many customers decide to buy a holiday home on our resort. Being trusted with family days out and holidays is a responsibility which we take very seriously but we are very proud to do so.” Follow Hull Live Our daily newsletter - To get the latest headlines direct to your email inbox every day, click here .

Shop All Your Bag Subtotal $0 View Bag Check Out is currently empty Looks like there's nothing in your cart. We can help with that. Shop All Hi, we're Essential body hair and care tools, reimagined with your body in mind. Think: high performance and innovative design for every routine, all at a nice price. Social Impact We Support Since launching in 2018, Flamingo has supported and donated to nonprofit organizations that work to ensure women build healthy relationships with their bodies. Through a commitment to education and healing we hold our brand promise to champion women and their bodies. How We Do It Education: We work with partners to create open dialogue and easier access to information that has historically been taboo or gatekept from women about their bodies—because we know that getting access to accurate information about women's bodies is not easy. Healing: We support partners who are helping women to address their body trauma, mindset, and well-being because we believe that emotional healing is an important step to having a healthy relationship with your body. Girl Scouts mission is to build girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place. Girl Scouts and Flamingo are embarking on a two-year partnership to learn what girls need to develop a healthy relationship with their bodies. Together, we will create a program for Girl Scouts that addresses important topics like body confidence. Exhale to Inhale uses trauma informed yoga to empower survivors of sexual and domestic violence and help communities develop skills and knowledge to support them. With our support of the scholarship training program, Exhale to Inhale has trained over 265 individuals with a focus on equity, access and representation, creating pathways for healing for thousands more survivors this year. Black Girls Smile provides gender-responsive and culturally-affirming mental wellness education, resources, and support geared toward Black women and girls. In partnership with Flamingo, BGS will provide education and opportunities for community building through their Intersectionality Workshop series, helping BGS reach 2,000 Black women and girls this year. Girls on the Run (GOTR) inspires girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a fun, experience-based curriculum that creatively integrates running. With Flamingo’s support, GOTR will develop and launch an enhanced suite of curricula to help participants recognize their inner strength, build confidence, and centers key social-emotional learning themes. The new curricula will be released across their network of 171+ councils, reaching an estimated 200,000 girls through 50,000 trained volunteer coaches. AAKOMA believes that to meet the mental health needs of Youth of Color, we need to operate at three levels: raising consciousness, providing accessible tools, and changing systems to provide better care. With our support, AAKOMA will provide nearly 350 hours of free virtual therapy to intersectionally diverse Young People of Color (including young people who identify as LGBTQAI+ and those with disabilities) with a special focus on African American and Black women/femmes. With our support The Alliance will add 2 new free, weekly clinician-led support groups to expand access to effective, data-driven care: one specifically tailored for and by the BIPOC community and another for individuals in mid-life and beyond. As part of the partnership, The Alliance will also study the impact of these groups, ensuring there will be more robust data sets that shed light on this important issue going forward.
