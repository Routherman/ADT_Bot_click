Members Only Daytona 200 MC Club History Florida's \n\n\n\n                        oldest continually operating motorcycle club Founded in May of 1943, we are one of Florida's oldest established motorcycle clubs. The American Motorcyclist Association ( AMA ) has us chartered as number 421 in 1960, but a notice in the February 1947 AMA magazine says that the 'Daytona Beach Motorcycle Club' chartered with them that month, However the Building that the AMA Records were stored in had a Fire in 1960 and All Records prior to 1960 were lost. This early AMA number indicates that 1947 club was a sign of what was to become the Daytona 200. We believe that the First Signs of the Club began when the AMA asked for Local Riders to volunteer to be Flagmen for the Original Daytona 200 Motorcycle Race to be held on the Beach and Road Course. Those Riders met to help at the Race each year from 1937 through 1941. When the Race was suspended for Safety Sake after the 1941 Bombing at Pearl Harbor, there was no event in 1942, the Flagmen then decided to form The Daytona Beach Motorcycle Club in May of 1943 and the Parent Club of the Daytona 200 Motorcycle Club was born. We began life as a combination Dirt Bike and Road Riding Club. Riders from all over the world have come to Daytona to participate in our famous 'Alligator Enduro.' The enduro was founded in 1949, and we ran it for 30 years. However, in or about 1980-1981 the Club decided to Divide, and the Dirt Riders formed the Daytona Dirt Riders (who still run the Alligator Enduro) and the Daytona 200 MC began the 'Alligator Road Tour' that was now held in its place. The Road Tour was held every year during Bike Week and was continued through 2020, when it was discontinued during the Pandemic. Will it return? That is yet to be decided. For over 40 years we organized and hosted the famous 'Our Kids' charity run for\nthis area. This event was held in November every year and brought in a Nice Sized\nDonation for The Children's Home Society of Volusia, Flagler & Putnam Counties,\nOur Children First, and other local charities we supported over the years. We not only help the community, but we also find time to have fun! We host\nDinner Rides, Charity Poker Runs and hold Club Socials every month. We have also\nhad Overnight Rides where we have gone to visit unique places here in Florida\nsuch as Bok Tower Gardens and to ride the Ozella Trail. We also try to participate\nin the functions of other motorcycle organizations, especially those Local to the\nArea, and have donated funds to assist others that support Causes we believe in\nsuch as Veterans Groups. We host Riders from out of the area by offering Motorcycle Only Tent Camping on\nour grounds during the Bike Week and Biketoberfest Events. This helps to\ngenerate the funds we operate on and has allowed us to meet with Riders from\nall over the United States - as well as the World! We have had Campers that have stayed with us for over 20 years!! We have held\nWeddings here during Bike Week and Biketoberfest Events!! Campers from as far\naway as Swedeen, England, Italy, Brazil, Russia, Canada, and several South\nAmerican Countries have stayed with us to enjoy the Bike Week and Biketoberfest\nActivities. Anyone interested in joining the club or just joining us for a Ride is invited and\nwelcome to do so. Our Club motto is: 'We don't care what you ride, we care that\nyou ride.' We have had every make and model of all types of motorcycles. We\nwelcome Trikes, Sport Bikes, Touring Bikes, Cruisers, Spyder's, and Customs. If you\ncan keep up with our legal running speed, your Bike is welcome. Our members are good, hard-working folk, from all walks of life and all age\ngroups, but we all share one common interest...Motorcycling! Good, SAFE, FUN\nwith motorcycles. We meet the 3 rd Saturday of the Month- except for Special Occasions where we\nmove the Meeting to allow a Clean Up Day for the Camping Events, and No\nDecember Meeting where we host a Club Christmas Party in its place.

Coming off its first season of competition in the 2021 British Supersport Championship, the Triumph Street Triple RS wins its American debut at the World Center of Racing. The winning motorcycle was ridden by defending champion Brandon Paasch, who used his experience gained in the 2021 season with the Triumph Street Triple RS and his past success at the 200 to make the most of the 765 triple’s power around Daytona’s banking. Paasch started P4 and made it a Triumph 1 - 2 across the stripe first time around, and confidently keeping with the lead pack for the duration of the race. The Triumph 765 triple engine didn’t break a sweat as it endured the 57 lap, 200 mile, race to keep Paasch in the sweet spot. Coming out of the final pit-stop Paasch found himself in fourth, and a couple seconds outside of the lead pack. To catch-up with the front three, putting himself in position for the win, Paasch set the fastest lap of the race at 1:49:959. On the final turn of the final lap, Paasch who was patiently waiting for his opportunity, twisted the throttle and trusted the draft and the triple Triumph engine to power him to the win by 0.007 of a second at the chequers. Danny Eslick, who started P8, left the grid with a terrific start, and led the race by the end of the first lap. From there Eslick ran with the lead pack until the red flag. Mid-race, as a result of fighting the high-winds and spending a good amount of the race without the benefit of a draft, Eslick lost ground and his race-lead as he drifted into the pits on fumes. Coming out of the pit, Eslick was able to re-gain significant ground, ending the race with a 6th place finish. Jeremy Appleton – Global Racing Manager, Triumph Motorcycles : “The Street Triple RS proved its performance and reliability credentials with the win today. The unique nature of Daytona, with its long, high-speed banking and tight in-field showed our bike’s speed and handling abilities in Brandon’s capable hands. He had the race pace, race craft and great maturity today and this win was richly deserved. Danny also showed his class throughout the race and would, undoubtedly, have been right there at the end had the windy conditions running without a draft not slowed him on pit-road. On top of the performance from Brandon and Danny, the preparation, ability, and professionalism of the TOBC racing team cannot be over-stated. The effort and attention to detail that Michelle and her whole crew put into the build-up and execution of the race is a great example of single-minded dedication to winning. With the support of FreedomRoad Financial and all the team partners, Triumph is celebrating the biggest race win for the Street Triple RS to date. Michelle Lindsay – TOBC racing owner : “After the 2018 season, I wasn’t sure we’d be back at the top of the podium again. To win the Daytona 200 on our first race with Triumph is more than I could have ever asked for. I’m proud of Brandon and Danny for their performances today, and very thankful for Triumph Motorcycles and FreedomRoad Financial for helping us even get back on the grid, Boulder Motorsports for helping to build a winning motorcycle. I’m also extremely proud to have such an amazing group of individuals working in my team. Their dedication and work ethic towards getting the 765 on the podium are unparalleled. This win is truly a team effort, and we couldn’t have brought this great crew back together if it wasn’t for the support from our key sponsors Politus & Matovina P.A. Attorneys, Palm Beach Police and Fire Foundation, Jay Geeker Studios, Pirelli, and K-Tech.” Brandon Paasch – 2021 & 2022 Daytona 200 Winner : “We did it!!! It’s unbelievably surreal to be a 2-time Daytona 200 winner, but I can’t say this race didn’t play out exactly as I imagined it. After last year’s win, I knew I had a winning strategy, and after a full season on the Street Triple RS, I had complete confidence in the bike and in the preparation of the TOBC racing team, to execute it. I’m thankful for FreedomRoad Financial for helping to make this race effort possible, and for the continued support from the Classic Car Club of Manhattan, Evolve GT, and Luxe Star, and am looking forward to celebrating with the team.” Danny Eslick – 4-time Daytona 200 Winne r: “Today was tough. A couple things didn’t go my way, which kept me off the podium. Thanks to Triumph, FreedomRoad Financial, and TOBC racing, all of the right elements were here for the win. The bike and the team have all the right pieces for success. I’ll just have to wait a year to snag my 5th win.\" – END – For further information contact: Lisa Jones, Global PR & Events Manager lisa.jones@triumph.co.uk NOTES TO EDITORS About Triumph Motorcycles First established in 1902, Triumph Motorcycles celebrated 120 years of motorcycle manufacture in 2022. For more than three decades, Triumph Motorcycles has been based in Hinckley, Leicestershire, and has produced iconic bikes that perfectly blend authentic design, character, charisma and performance. With more than 83,389 motorcycles delivered in calendar year 2022, and on track to reach a milestone 800 dealers across the world in 2023, Triumph is the largest British motorcycle manufacturer. This focus, innovation and engineering passion has today created a broad range of bikes suited to all motorcycle riders, including the stunning Speed Triple 1200 RR, Tiger Sport 660 and Trident 660, all-new transcontinental Tiger 1200 and epic Tiger 900, world leading Rocket 3 R and GT, the new high-performance Street Triple 765 RS, iconic Scrambler 1200, and the legendary Triumph Bonneville family including the Bonneville Bobber, Thruxton RS, Speed Twin 900 Twin, Scrambler 900, and the iconic Bonneville T120 and T100 and the stunning Chrome Collection modern classics. Triumph currently employs around 3,000 personnel worldwide and has subsidiary operations in the UK, North America, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, Sweden (Scandinavia), Benelux, Brazil, India, China and Thailand as well as a network of independent distributors. Triumph has manufacturing facilities in Hinckley, Leicestershire, and Thailand plus CKD facilities in Brazil and India. The Triumph Bonneville, famously named to celebrate Triumph’s 1956 land speed record on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA, was the original British superbike and a race-winner straight out of the crate, chosen by famous motorcyclists of the past for its legendary handling, style, and character. Recently updated with even more performance, capability and style, it’s that handling, character and iconic looks, married to modern rider-focused technology that makes the new Bonneville family THE authentic modern classic choice today. Triumph has a glorious racing history, competing in and winning races in almost every class and field of motorcycle sporting achievement. From winning the second ever Isle of Man TT in 1908, through to 1960s road and track domination in Europe and America, right up to contemporary racing achievements with the Triumph triple powered 2014 and 2015 Supersports titles and World SuperSport racing, Isle of Man Supersports TT wins in 2014 and 2019, courtesy of Gary Johnson and Peter Hickman, plus an average speed of over 130mph 2023 by Peter Hickman on his Triumph STR765, and a thrilling last-lap victory at the legendary Daytona 200 by Brandon Paasch on the Street Triple 765 in 2022. Triumph’s racing legend continues as the exclusive engine supplier to the FIM Moto2™ World Championship since the start of the 2019 season. Triumph Motorcycles provides all of the teams with race-tuned 765cc triples, each of which is based on the class-leading Street Triple RS powerplant. Redefining the class and breaking record after record in the inaugural year, including the first ever +300km/h Moto2™ top speed, the 2020 season got even faster with another 11 all-time lap records and seven different winners from 15 races. Reflecting these great successes, the wonderful feedback and partnerships that Triumph have had with the riders and their teams, and the incredible response from Triumph fans across the world, Triumph and Dorna, in 2021, decided to extend our relationship and sign a new contract for another three years of racing: 2022 – 2024. The 765 Triumph Triple has so far achieved 73 race and outright lap records, enabled 21 different riders to win a Moto2™ race, with 8 different winners in 2022 alone. A 300km/h top speed has been reached at least once in each season, with the bar being moved even higher during practice at the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, when both Celestino Vietti and Darryn Binder recorded the highest ever top speed in Moto2™ of 301.6 km/h.  Triumph 765cc triples have raced more than one million kms, proving the engine’s outstanding performance and reliability. Triumph’s racing activities are further bolstered by a return to the World Superbike paddock in 2022 with a factory-supported race team, Dynavolt Triumph, in the World Supersport Championship. In 2021 Triumph announced their forthcoming entry into the Motocross and Enduro worlds as well as a new factory racing effort, with a commitment to top tier championship racing in both Motocross and Enduro series. In 2022 Triumph revealed their partnership with Thierry Chizat-Suzzoni, one of the sport’s most experienced and successful team owners, who will field two of Triumph’s all-new 250cc 4-stroke MX bikes in the 2024 MX2 class and will add an entry into the 450cc MXGP class in 2025, and with Team Principal Bobby Hewitt and Team Manager Stephen ‘Scuba’ Westfall to field its all-new Triumph 250cc 4-stroke MX bikes in the 2024 SuperMotocross World Championship, which is comprised of the Monster Energy Supercross World Championship, and the Pro Motocross Championship, with three season-ending SuperMotocross rounds.  For the 2025 season Triumph will additionally field its new 450cc bike in the SuperMotocross World Championship. In July 2022, Iván Cervantes secured victory in the Baja Aragón. Cervantes dominated the 450km race and crossed the finish line 1 hour and 6 minutes ahead of his rivals in the Trail category. In the scratch classification, which included professional riders with light 450cc rally motorcycles, Cervantes achieved an even more remarkable 11th position, clearly demonstrating the Tiger’s ability to compete at an elite level of competition. In 2023 Triumph officially claimed the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for ‘The greatest distance on a motorcycle in 24 hours (individual)’.  Riding a factory-specification Tiger 1200 GT Explorer on the High-Speed Ring at the Nardò Technical Center in Italy, 5x Enduro World Champion and Triumph Global Ambassador Iván Cervantes travelled more than 4012km in a 24-hour period, beating the previous record of 3406km by a huge margin of more than 600km. In 2023, Triumph launched the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X: two all-new models. Designed from the ground-up with a brand-new single engine platform at their heart, these new models have been designed to deliver a fun, agile and confidence-inspiring ride for riders of all ages and experience levels. Conceived and designed in Hinckley, UK, these accessible new models represent incredible value for money and bring Triumph’s iconic style, quality and performance to a whole new generation of Triumph riders.
