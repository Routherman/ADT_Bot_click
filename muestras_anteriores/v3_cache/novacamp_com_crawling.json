The site was very tight, our awning could not be extended all the way.  The majority of the sites are like this.  Their electrical box made a sizzling sound when we plugged into the 30 amp so we plugged into the 50 amp and used a dogbone.  Backing into the site required maneuvering around old trees.  When leaving the campground, they have a sign to swing wide to avoid hitting a tree limb that overhangs the exit.  (Why not trim the tree?)   One Pro:  Campers were very friendly.   Some things we overlook but Bait and Switch is wrong and we've never had this kind of problem with any other campgrounds we have stayed in. Read Less Helpful 9 Own this park? Reply to this review CWC 1 reviews · 1 review votes Member 1 1 out of 5 stars 05/25/2020 The campground and restrooms were fine not great, but okay. However I am giving the facility only one star because of their shady way of handling the Good Sam discount program. They advertise themselves as a Good Sam park, but then only allow you to use your discount for one night. This is the only park that I've ever had restrict the number of nights that I'm allowed to use this discount. Helpful 13 Own this park?

That makes no sense. They are going to be the same whether they are in a tent or RV. Pet owners beware!!! Not really pet friendly like they say on their website.

There are many long term residents and police were there several times dealing with some of the residents.

We were really grateful for the site, and tho they told us it was a back in, we had no idea how hard it was going to be to get into it.  Because the park was so full, people were parked in places where they shouldn't have been or hanging out into the streets.  If it had not been so late, or we had not been so tired, we would not have stayed.  With this being said, the park did feel comfortable and safe.  And though they had several amenities, we did not use them, so will not comment on them.  Would we stay here again?  Only if we were given a site that was truly accommodating for a long 5th wheel.

Appears that many of the sites especially the more attractive (with best shade) ones were occupied by long term / permanent occupants.\r\nCable TV worked really well. Not too far away from services & Interstate.\r\nRestrooms need serious upgrading. Might go back. Helpful 9 Own this park?

All three ratings categories are measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Less than 1 percent of parks or campgrounds receive the coveted 10 | 10 | 10 rating, which indicates superior facilities that are well maintained, clean, well-appointed restrooms and a highly appealing appearance. Campgrounds are inspected annually by dedicated RVers like you. Completeness of facilities 10 10 10 The first campground rating evaluates completeness and quality of facilities. In this category we rate interior roads, sites, registration area, hookups, recreation, swimming, security, laundry, store and building maintenance. Cleanliness of restrooms and showers 10 10 10 The second rating category concerns the cleanliness and physical characteristics of toilets, walls, showers, sinks/counters/mirrors and floor. If a park achieves a full point in each of the above, it receives a star ( ), indicating exceptionally clean restrooms. Also rated are physical characteristics of restrooms, including interior construction, adequate supplies/odor free, adequate number of facilities, exterior appearance and location in relation to park spaces, and interior appearance. Visual appeal and environmental quality 10 10 10 This category addresses the park's setting and site layout, function and identification of signage, overall exterior building maintenance, noise, trash disposal, litter and debris around the grounds and sites, and appearance of grounds, sites and entrance area.

Jan 2023, the campground called and said I needed to pay for my Feb 2023 stay or lose my deposit and the price went up so I had to pay more money though the email they sent five months ago contained the lower price they originally quoted me.  (They charged more than KOA's campgrounds!)  Payment wasn't supposed to be due until 30 days before arrival, they wanted their money before the 30 days.  The site was very tight, our awning could not be extended all the way.  The majority of the sites are like this.  Their electrical box made a sizzling sound when we plugged into the 30 amp so we plugged into the 50 amp and used a dogbone.  Backing into the site required maneuvering around old trees.  When leaving the campground, they have a sign to swing wide to avoid hitting a tree limb that overhangs the exit.  (Why not trim the tree?)   One Pro:  Campers were very friendly.   Some things we overlook but Bait and Switch is wrong and we've never had this kind of problem with any other campgrounds we have stayed in. Read Less Helpful 9 Own this park? Reply to this review CWC 1 reviews · 1 review votes 1 1 out of 5 stars 05/25/2020 The campground and restrooms were fine not great, but okay. However I am giving the facility only one star because of their shady way of handling the Good Sam discount program. They advertise themselves as a Good Sam park, but then only allow you to use your discount for one night. This is the only park that I've ever had restrict the number of nights that I'm allowed to use this discount. Helpful 13 Own this park?

That makes no sense. They are going to be the same whether they are in a tent or RV. Pet owners beware!!! Not really pet friendly like they say on their website. It says they are not allowed in the cabins only. Misleading website that needs to be updated. Helpful 10 Own this park?

The sewer receptacles are too far above the ground so tanks do not empty. You have to fill hose and the raise it to empty gray and black water tanks. The leaves do not get raked, we had to rake our own site since there are no fire rings and were told to build fire anywhere. There are many long term residents and police were there several times dealing with some of the residents. It is very convenient to many Daytona Beach locations but it wasn't what I have come to expect from Good Sam parks. Read Less Helpful 12 Own this park?

We were really grateful for the site, and tho they told us it was a back in, we had no idea how hard it was going to be to get into it.  Because the park was so full, people were parked in places where they shouldn't have been or hanging out into the streets.  If it had not been so late, or we had not been so tired, we would not have stayed.  With this being said, the park did feel comfortable and safe.  And though they had several amenities, we did not use them, so will not comment on them.  Would we stay here again?  Only if we were given a site that was truly accommodating for a long 5th wheel.

Appears that many of the sites especially the more attractive (with best shade) ones were occupied by long term / permanent occupants.\r\nCable TV worked really well. Not too far away from services & Interstate.\r\nRestrooms need serious upgrading. Might go back. Helpful 9 Own this park?

Camp America / Reseberättelser / Nova, camp Namn: Nova Camp: Camp Echo Nova, camp Onsdag 11 September 2024 Antal veckor på camp: Jag spenderade cirka 8 veckor på camp. Första veckan var så kallad staff orientation, vilket innebar att förbereda all personal för deras roller och ansvar. Det inkluderar orientering och introduktion till lägrets mål och regler, säkerhetsutbildning, träning i specifika aktiviteter, team-building, genomgång av policyer och procedurer, samt rollspecifik träning. Målet är att alla ska vara väl förberedda och känna sig bekväma i sina roller innan lägret börjar. Jag jobbade där som videograf/fotograf, vi fick genomgång på vad som förväntades av oss och så satt vi upp alla datorer osv allt som behövdes, sen satt vi igång direkt att öva på att filma o redigera etc genom att sätta ihop vår första echo cast för all personal. Echocast var en video som vi visade för barnen varje söndag där vi hade deras skits, bits och reklamfilmer. Varför sökte du till Camp America? Först funderade jag på att åka som au pair, men efter att ha surfat runt på Skandinaviska Institutets hemsida hittade jag information om att man kunde jobba på ett sommarläger i USA. Jag insåg att det passade perfekt eftersom jag då kunde få en liknande upplevelse, men bara under 8 veckor, vilket gjorde det till en slags testperiod. Detta kändes som handen i handsken för mig eftersom jag alltid har tyckt om att arbeta med barn och ungdomar. Dessutom är det en unik möjlighet att få uppleva något som verkligen är ”once in a lifetime”. Att jobba på ett sommarläger i USA innebär att jag fick chansen att lära mig att hantera olika situationer som kan uppstå när man arbetar med barn. Det var också en fantastisk möjlighet att träffa nya människor från olika delar av världen och få vänner för livet. Genom att vara en del av lägergemenskapen fick jag också en djupare förståelse för amerikansk kultur och traditioner, vilket är ovärderligt. Berätta om ditt camp! Camp Echo är ett traditionellt sleep-away camp i Bloomingburg som ligger i staten New York. Vi var runt 200 anställda, majoriteten var internationella och resten var amerikanska. Lägret har två olika perioder antingen 3, 4 eller 7 veckor. Barnen var mellan 6 och 17 år gamla, vilket innebar att vi hade en stor variation av åldrar och intressen att ta hänsyn till. Lägret erbjöd en mängd olika aktiviteter, allt från ridning och höghöjdsbanor till kanotpaddling och konstverkstäder. Detta gjorde att varje barn kunde hitta något som de verkligen brann för, samtidigt som de fick chansen att prova på nya saker. Aktiviteterna var noggrant utvalda för att inte bara underhålla, utan också för att främja lagarbete, självförtroende och personligt växande. Alla bodde i cabins. I varje cabin bodde det mellan 2- 6 ledare med barnen beroende på hur många barn det var. Vi hade runt 300 barn under varje period. Jag var med i mediateamet så jag bodde med de andra från vårt mediateam eftersom att vår prio ett var att fånga de magiska ögonblicken vare sig de va att fota eller filma aktiviteterna som barnen gjorde på camp. Vi hade dock fortfarande varsin grupp med barn som vi var med när vi hade tid över. Hur såg en vanlig dag ut? Dagen började med att alla blev väckta varje morgon 8.15 via högtalaren som var kopplad in till varje bunk. Jag var med de yngre barnen så efter flaggan hade blivit hissad så gick de yngre barnen ner till frukost. Frukosten serverades vid 8.30 för de yngre barnen. Efter frukost så hade barnen cabin clean up som innebär att de städade upp i deras stuga. Efter det så gjorde man det som stog på schemat för dagen (varje grupp hade olika aktiviteter). Vi hade totalt 6 olika ”perioder” under dagen, tre före lunch och sedan tre efter lunch. Dessa perioderna höll på i 40 minuter var och det kunde va allt ifrån höghöjdsbana till att de skulle göra keramik i arts and crafts. Lunchen för de yngre barnen var 12.40 och sedan har de rest hour vilket innebär att de vila tills fjärde perioden börja. Sedan efter alla perioderna så har de snack and go 16.30 vilket var glass. Klockan 18 så åt de yngre barnen middag. Under både lunchen och middagen så var det en hel den sång och dans. Efter middagen så har de shower hour vilket var att alla barnen skulle duscha (vilket kunde va lite knepigt ibland för att de hade totalt 1 timme på sig och så var de kanske 15 barn som skulle duscha på den tiden.) Sedan klockan 20 så var det en kvällsaktivitet, det kunde var allt från smores till att det kom en hypnotisk och uppträdde. När kvällsaktiviteten var avslutad så fick barnen mjölk och kakor och sedan var det dags för de yngsta att börja gå och lägga sig. Vad var det bästa och det tuffaste med sommaren på campet? För att var ärlig hade jag nog sagt att hela upplevelsen var det bästa med camp. Framför allt så var de alla människorna som jag lärde känna vare sig det var barnen eller personalen. Det tuffaste hade jag nog sagt var att var sjuk på camp för att man känner att man missar så mycket och sedan så finns det risk att man får lite mer hemlängtan när man är sjuk. Vad gjorde du när du var ledig? När jag var ledig hade jag en kväll i veckan och oftast en dag i veckan ledigt, och de hängde ofta ihop. Vad vi gjorde berodde helt på vad vi kände för just den specifika kvällen, men ofta åkte vi till Middletown, som var den närmaste staden med många aktiviteter. Det fanns allt från karaoke och Walmart till bowling. Vi brukade också passa på att utforska andra delar av staden, äta på olika restauranger och bara njuta av att vara utanför campet. Det var en perfekt tid för att koppla av, ha kul och ladda batterierna inför kommande veckas aktiviteter. Vad skulle du säga till andra som funderar på att söka till Camp America med oss på Skandinaviska Institutet? Jag skulle säga: Sök!! Om du vill uppleva något du sent kommer att glömma, så är detta något för dig. Det kommer att vara som en berg- och dalbana, men det är 100% värt det i slutändan. Den unika möjligheten att arbeta med barn och ungdomar i en så rolig och unik miljö är verkligen en ”once in a lifetime”-upplevelse. Du kommer att skapa minnen som varar livet ut. Dessutom får du chansen att utforska en ny kultur och förbättra dina språkkunskaper, samtidigt som du utvecklas både personligt och professionellt. Det är en fantastisk chans att testa på något nytt och utmanande under en kortare period.

Ratings Summary Overall Rating Access Location Cleanliness Site Quality Noise Cell Phone Coverage Verizon 4G Confirmed by 1 User Last reported 2/26/2024 Reviews (2) Notes Videos Blog Posts Thomas M. 1 review “One of the worst parks in our travel history” Reviewed 4/1/2024 Nightly rate: $50 Days stayed: 4 Site Number: 959 Overall Rating We provided the size of our RV while booking and were assigned a spot that was way to small. We arrived late and realized that the spot was way to small, we had to take empty one next to it. Next day Office said we can stay. Later they called and said we have to move. They even threatend us with the police. I stayed resilient and we could stay. All other sites are tiny to and you park window on window with your neighbor. The restrooms are disgusting and the rusted laundry machines are outside, unusable. The only positive thing is the pool, it's kind of new compared to the rest of this filthy park. We will definitfly never come back and are happy to leave! Access Location Cleanliness Site Quality Noise Helpful 0 This review is the opinion of a Campendium member and not of Campendium.com Oldnavy59 5 reviews “Location, location location ” Reviewed 2/26/2024 Nightly rate: $55 Days stayed: 4 Site Number: 200 Overall Rating Friendly staff, well maintained Park. Spots are tight and from what I saw mostly grass spots . Looks like a heated pool, dog Park free wifi free cable are some of the amenities. Located in Port Orange lots of eating and shopping options. Close to the beach. Overall a nice place to stay Forgot to mention $4 for pets Access Location Cleanliness Site Quality Noise Verizon 4G Oldnavy59 would stay here again Helpful 0 This review is the opinion of a Campendium member and not of Campendium.com Be the first to add a note for Nova Family Campground!

The site was very tight, our awning could not be extended all the way.  The majority of the sites are like this.  Their electrical box made a sizzling sound when we plugged into the 30 amp so we plugged into the 50 amp and used a dogbone.  Backing into the site required maneuvering around old trees.  When leaving the campground, they have a sign to swing wide to avoid hitting a tree limb that overhangs the exit.  (Why not trim the tree?)   One Pro:  Campers were very friendly.

However I am giving the facility only one star because of their shady way of handling the Good Sam discount program. They advertise themselves as a Good Sam park, but then only allow you to use your discount for one night. This is the only park that I've ever had restrict the number of nights that I'm allowed to use this discount. Helpful 13 Own this park?

We were really grateful for the site, and tho they told us it was a back in, we had no idea how hard it was going to be to get into it.  Because the park was so full, people were parked in places where they shouldn't have been or hanging out into the streets.  If it had not been so late, or we had not been so tired, we would not have stayed.  With this being said, the park did feel comfortable and safe.  And though they had several amenities, we did not use them, so will not comment on them.  Would we stay here again?  Only if we were given a site that was truly accommodating for a long 5th wheel.

Appears that many of the sites especially the more attractive (with best shade) ones were occupied by long term / permanent occupants.\r\nCable TV worked really well. Not too far away from services & Interstate.\r\nRestrooms need serious upgrading. Might go back. Helpful 9 Own this park?

All three ratings categories are measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Less than 1 percent of parks or campgrounds receive the coveted 10 | 10 | 10 rating, which indicates superior facilities that are well maintained, clean, well-appointed restrooms and a highly appealing appearance. Campgrounds are inspected annually by dedicated RVers like you. Completeness of facilities 10 10 10 The first campground rating evaluates completeness and quality of facilities. In this category we rate interior roads, sites, registration area, hookups, recreation, swimming, security, laundry, store and building maintenance. Cleanliness of restrooms and showers 10 10 10 The second rating category concerns the cleanliness and physical characteristics of toilets, walls, showers, sinks/counters/mirrors and floor. If a park achieves a full point in each of the above, it receives a star ( ), indicating exceptionally clean restrooms. Also rated are physical characteristics of restrooms, including interior construction, adequate supplies/odor free, adequate number of facilities, exterior appearance and location in relation to park spaces, and interior appearance. Visual appeal and environmental quality 10 10 10 This category addresses the park's setting and site layout, function and identification of signage, overall exterior building maintenance, noise, trash disposal, litter and debris around the grounds and sites, and appearance of grounds, sites and entrance area.

Jan 2023, the campground called and said I needed to pay for my Feb 2023 stay or lose my deposit and the price went up so I had to pay more money though the email they sent five months ago contained the lower price they originally quoted me.  (They charged more than KOA's campgrounds!)  Payment wasn't supposed to be due until 30 days before arrival, they wanted their money before the 30 days.  The site was very tight, our awning could not be extended all the way.  The majority of the sites are like this.  Their electrical box made a sizzling sound when we plugged into the 30 amp so we plugged into the 50 amp and used a dogbone.  Backing into the site required maneuvering around old trees.  When leaving the campground, they have a sign to swing wide to avoid hitting a tree limb that overhangs the exit.  (Why not trim the tree?)   One Pro:  Campers were very friendly.   Some things we overlook but Bait and Switch is wrong and we've never had this kind of problem with any other campgrounds we have stayed in. Read Less Helpful 9 Own this park? Reply to this review CWC 1 reviews · 1 review votes 1 1 out of 5 stars 05/25/2020 The campground and restrooms were fine not great, but okay. However I am giving the facility only one star because of their shady way of handling the Good Sam discount program. They advertise themselves as a Good Sam park, but then only allow you to use your discount for one night. This is the only park that I've ever had restrict the number of nights that I'm allowed to use this discount. Helpful 13 Own this park?

That makes no sense. They are going to be the same whether they are in a tent or RV. Pet owners beware!!! Not really pet friendly like they say on their website. It says they are not allowed in the cabins only. Misleading website that needs to be updated. Helpful 10 Own this park?

The sewer receptacles are too far above the ground so tanks do not empty. You have to fill hose and the raise it to empty gray and black water tanks. The leaves do not get raked, we had to rake our own site since there are no fire rings and were told to build fire anywhere. There are many long term residents and police were there several times dealing with some of the residents. It is very convenient to many Daytona Beach locations but it wasn't what I have come to expect from Good Sam parks. Read Less Helpful 12 Own this park?

There were several events happening in the city and most RV parks were all booked.

We were really grateful for the site, and tho they told us it was a back in, we had no idea how hard it was going to be to get into it.  Because the park was so full, people were parked in places where they shouldn't have been or hanging out into the streets.  If it had not been so late, or we had not been so tired, we would not have stayed.  With this being said, the park did feel comfortable and safe.  And though they had several amenities, we did not use them, so will not comment on them.  Would we stay here again?  Only if we were given a site that was truly accommodating for a long 5th wheel.

Appears that many of the sites especially the more attractive (with best shade) ones were occupied by long term / permanent occupants.\r\nCable TV worked really well. Not too far away from services & Interstate.\r\nRestrooms need serious upgrading. Might go back. Helpful 9 Own this park?

Jesus will come again for His church. 08. There will be a day of judgment. 09. God hears and answers our prayers according to His will. 70 Years and Counting We are so thankful to be celebrating over 70 years of ministry. We carry a rich legacy of walking with children and families toward Christ and seek for that legacy to grow.

Ranger Reviewed Apr. 11, 2023 Disappointing It appears our DELUXE site is surrounded by permanent residents. LOTS of rundown stuff on each site. Even old Christmas decorations. Apparently, only this center hub has cable and internet, so . . .  They offered to move us to another site (108), but it looked even worse—like a junkyard. The pictures represented on line are not in this DELUXE area, but you’d think the DELUXE area would be even nicer. NOT. I guess the meaning of DELUXE is different for everyone. Some areas look nicer, but you don’t get wifi and cable except at the center hub.\nChoose your site carefully. On close inspection, not even sure I want to use the laundromat. Sorry.
