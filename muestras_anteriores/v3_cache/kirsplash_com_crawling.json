Each tale in this work of graphic nonfiction, depicted by a different, talented illustrator, is told from the point of view of a real trans person. Brooke Guinan fought to make the NYC Fire Department more diverse and inclusive. Diamond Stylz, executive director of Black Trans Women Inc., endured bullying and parental neglect before meeting supportive queer friends and filing a lawsuit against her school for the right to attend prom in a dress. Marli Washington grappled with alcoholism and disordered eating but eventually began transitioning, fell in love, and started a company that designs chest binders. The individuals profiled are racially diverse and include transgender men and women as well as nonbinary people. Though it isn’t entirely clear how the stories came to be written (the subjects aren’t listed as co-authors, nor is there an explanation about an interview process), it’s a small point. The book overwhelmingly leaves readers with a sense of positivity. Even when the subjects confront painful situations—being bullied, getting kicked out of the house—all agree: It’s important to find a way to be true to yourself. They discuss not only their gender transitions, but also how they discovered their voices, passions, and careers. Though the work will resonate with many readers, it will especially speak to trans youth. Inspiring and honest accounts from relatable role models.

Alyssa’s diary entries start in September 2000, in the first week of her seventh grade year. She’s 11 and dealing with typical preteen concerns—popularity and anxiety about grades—along with other things more particular to her own life. She’s shuffling between Queens and Manhattan to share time between her divorced parents and struggling with thick facial hair and classmates who make her feel like she’s “not a whole person” due to her mixed White and Puerto Rican heritage. Alyssa is endlessly earnest and awkward as she works up the courage to talk to her crush, Alejandro; gushes about her dreams of becoming a shoe designer; and tries to solve her burgeoning unibrow problem. The diaries also have a darker side, as a sense of impending doom builds as the entries approach 9/11, especially because Alyssa’s father works in finance in the World Trade Center. As a number of the diary entries are taken directly from the author’s originals, they effortlessly capture the loud, confusing feelings middle school brings out. The artwork, in its muted but effective periwinkle tones, lends a satisfying layer to the diary’s accessible and delightful format. An authentic and moving time capsule of middle school angst, trauma, and joy.\n                                        (author's note) (Graphic memoir. 8-13) 1 Pub Date: Aug. 17, 2021 ISBN: 978-1-250-77427-9 Page Count: 288 Publisher: Roaring Brook Press Review Posted Online: June 15, 2021 Kirkus Reviews Issue: July 1, 2021 Categories: CHILDREN'S BIOGRAPHY & MEMOIR | BIOGRAPHY & MEMOIR | CHILDREN'S SOCIAL THEMES | CHILDREN'S HISTORY Share your opinion of this book More by Andrea Beatriz Arango BOOK REVIEW IVELIZ EXPLAINS IT ALL by Andrea Beatriz Arango ; \n                    illustrated by Alyssa Bermudez BOOK REVIEW WE LAUGH ALIKE / JUNTOS NOS REÍMOS by Carmen T.

STORIES From the They Did What? series by Saundra Mitchell ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 10, 2016 A breezy, bustling bucketful of courageous acts and eye-popping feats. bookshelf shop now amazon Barnes & Noble BN.com Why should grown-ups get all the historical, scientific, athletic, cinematic, and artistic glory? Choosing exemplars from both past and present, Mitchell includes but goes well beyond Alexander the Great, Anne Frank, and like usual suspects to introduce a host of lesser-known luminaries. These include Shapur II, who was formally crowned king of Persia before he was born, Indian dancer/professional architect Sheila Sri Prakash, transgender spokesperson Jazz Jennings, inventor Param Jaggi, and an international host of other teen or preteen activists and prodigies. The individual portraits range from one paragraph to several pages in length, and they are interspersed with group tributes to, for instance, the Nazi-resisting “Swingkinder,” the striking New York City newsboys, and the marchers of the Birmingham Children’s Crusade. Mitchell even offers would-be villains a role model in Elagabalus, “boy emperor of Rome,” though she notes that he, at least, came to an awful end: “Then, then! They dumped his remains in the Tiber River, to be nommed by fish for all eternity.” The entries are arranged in no evident order, and though the backmatter includes multiple booklists, a personality quiz, a glossary, and even a quick Braille primer (with Braille jokes to decode), there is no index. Still, for readers whose fires need lighting, there’s motivational kindling on nearly every page. A breezy, bustling bucketful of courageous acts and eye-popping feats.  \n                                        (finished illustrations not seen) (Collective biography. 10-13) 3 Pub Date: May 10, 2016 ISBN: 978-0-14-751813-2 Page Count: 320 Publisher: Puffin Review Posted Online: Nov. 10, 2015 Kirkus Reviews Issue: Dec. 1, 2015 Categories: CHILDREN'S BIOGRAPHY & MEMOIR Share your opinion of this book More In The Series BOOK REVIEW 50 UNBELIEVABLE WOMEN AND THEIR FASCINATING (AND TRUE!)

Let the professionals at Kirsplash take care of it. We understand that your time is a precious and limited commodity, and you have better things to spend it on than cleaning the pool and spa. There are many components to properly maintaining a swimming pool, and each pool and spa has its own unique features and conditions: Nearby trees that constantly rain debris into the water. Excessive shade or sun that happens to provide the ideal conditions for algae to thrive. The list goes on and the average homeowner finds themselves woefully unequipped to handle these challenges. That’s where we come in. Weekly Maintenance Weekly Maintenance Give yourself a pass! Our flexible routine service packages take the stress out of pool maintenance without making you feel guilty! With our highly trained service professionals, dependable scheduling, and regular communication, you can rest assured of top-quality pool care and prompt notice of any issues that may arise with your pool. Pool Inspection Pool Inspection A swimming pool is a great investment for your home. There is a sense of confidence in the quality of the pool if you hired the contractor, selected the materials and design, and were actively involved throughout the project. But what if you are purchasing a home with an existing pool? How would you know if it is working as intended? Are there any repairs needed? Kirsplash Pools offers residential pool inspection services to put your mind at ease. We perform a visual and operational inspection of the pool and equipment. After our inspection is completed, we provide a report with repair recommendations and referrals to capable companies if needed. Equipment Repair Equipment Repair Kirsplash Pools also specializes in pool repair. Should an issue arise with any of your pool and spa equipment, please don’t hesitate to contact us to set up an appointment. The only thing worse than an equipment or maintenance issue is one that isn’t taken care of in a timely manner. As a certified Jandy, Hayward, Maytronics, and Polaris dealer, our trained technicians are able to repair and replace their equipment. Contact us today to speak with one of our pool care specialists to learn what maintenance program would work best for you and your pool or to speak with one of our service repair technicians. Energy-Efficient Upgrades This browser does not support the video element. Energy-Efficient Upgrades The term energy efficiency is oftentimes thought of as a buzz phrase, touting the latest trends in environmentally-friendly living, however, as a pool owner, energy efficiency means so much more. Not only does energy-efficient pool and spa equipment reduce pool operating costs, but it also cuts down on energy usage and saves water. And at Kirsplash Pools, we are dedicated to giving both you and the environment a little break. Pool and spa equipment manufacturers offer a variety of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products that can help pool owners save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year on their electricity bills. While there is a greater initial investment to incorporate energy-efficient equipment, the rate of return, in the long run, is worth it.

By Biography.com Editors and Catherine Caruso Updated: Sep 30, 2024 6:36 PM EDT Getty Images 1936-2024 Kris Kristofferson Latest News: Actor and Musician Dies at Age 88 Actor and singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson died at his home in Maui, Hawaii, on September 28. The 88-year-old was surrounded by family, who shared that he “passed away peacefully.” No cause of death was provided. Kristofferson is survived by his wife, Lisa Meyers, and his eight children. “We’re all so blessed for our time with him,” the family said in a statement. “Thank you for loving him all these many years, and when you see a rainbow, know he’s smiling down at us all.” Kristofferson was best known for his leading role in the 1976 musical drama A Star Is Born , co-starring Barbra Streisand , and his songwriting contributions to folk and country music , including the hits “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” and “Me and Bobby McGee.” Jump to: Who Was Kris Kristofferson? Quick Facts Early Life Music Career: Songs, Grammys, and More Movies Wife and Children Declining Health Quotes Who Was Kris Kristofferson? An award-winning musician and actor, Kris Kristofferson had a slow start in country music until artists such as Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis began to record his songs. His big breakthrough came in 1971, when Janis Joplin ’s version of his song “Me and Bobby McGee” reached the top of the charts. Around the same time, Kristofferson launched a successful career as an actor with memorable roles in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore , the 1976 remake of A Star Is Born with Barbra Streisand , Lone Star , and the Blade movies. Simultaneously maintaining his legendary career as a songwriter and performer, he won three Grammy Awards , was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Country Music Hall of Fame, and saw his songs at the top of the charts throughout much of his life. Kristofferson died in September 2024 at age 88. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Kristoffer Kristofferson BORN: June 22, 1936 DIED: September 28, 2024 BIRTHPLACE: Brownsville, Texas SPOUSES: Fran Beer (1960-1969), Rita Coolidge (1973-1980), and Lisa Meyers (1983-2024) CHILDREN: Tracey, Kris Jr., Casey, Jesse, Jody, Johnny, Kelly Marie, and Blake ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer Early Life Kristoffer Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, on June 22, 1936, as the first of three children in a conservative military family. When Kristofferson was a boy, his family moved around often but eventually settled in San Mateo, California, when he was in junior high. After graduating from high school in 1954, Kristofferson attended Pomona College in Southern California, where he focused on creative writing and the poetry of William Blake . Demonstrating the talent that would serve him well later in his life, Kristofferson won several awards for his work, including first prize in a short-story contest held by The Atlantic Monthly . He also played football for the school and was a Golden Gloves boxer. The bright student graduated from Pomona with honors in 1958 and won a Rhodes scholarship to study at Oxford University. He moved to England later that year to pursue his master’s degree in literature. He also started writing songs and was soon performing at local clubs as Kris Carson. Although he eventually recorded a few songs for a small label, they failed to gain him recognition, and he returned home after completing his studies. Now standing at a crossroads in his life, Kristofferson chose to change direction, eschewing further academic pursuits to follow in his father’s footsteps and join the military. He enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he was trained as a ranger and helicopter pilot before being stationed in West Germany. During his service, however, he held on to his love of writing and music and eventually organized a soldiers’ band that performed at various functions. Musicians in the Military Elvis Presley Johnny Cash Zach Bryan By 1965, Kristofferson had achieved the rank of captain and was offered a position as an English instructor at the West Point military academy. However, after taking a trip to the musical mecca of Nashville that June, he decided to change the course of his life once more, rejecting his job offer, resigning from the military, and setting off to become a country music songwriter. Music Career: Songs, Grammys, and More Kristofferson’s chosen path wasn’t an easy one. His parents were so distressed by his decision that their relationship with him became severely strained; he didn’t speak to his mother for more than 20 years. “It was actually a very liberating thing to be cut loose from any expectations from anybody,” Kristofferson later told CBS News . Although Kristofferson signed with the publisher Bighorn Music shortly after moving with his first wife and young daughter to Nashville, the meager income it brought wasn’t enough to support his family. He worked a range of odd jobs, including as a janitor, over the next several years to make ends meet. Keep Reading 15 Famous Country Singers of the Past and Present Get to Know 6 History-Making Black Country Singers During this period, Kristofferson did make some progress, as other artists recorded his songs such as “Viet Nam Blues” and “Jody and the Kid” that made it onto the country charts. However, his debut single as a performer, 1967’s “Golden Idol,” fared less well; it failed to chart. Kristofferson’s struggles intensified in 1968, when his second child was born with health problems that led to soaring medical bills. Through it all, Kristofferson’s talents as a songwriter only grew stronger, and in 1969, his fortune began to change when Roger Miller’s cover of his song “Me and Bobby McGee” reached the country Top 20. His songs—known for their vivid narratives and piercing lyrics—also drew the attention of Johnny Cash . Once Kristofferson personally delivered a song to the music star by landing a helicopter in Cash’s yard. Kristofferson’s bravado led Cash to have him as a guest on The Johnny Cash Show and also to introduce Kristofferson at the Newport Folk Festival. These appearances gave Kristofferson’s career a much-needed lift and brought him to the brink of one of his most successful eras. Debut Album: Kristofferson Getty Images Kris Kristofferson worked odd jobs during his first several years in Nashville before the release of his debut album in 1970. In 1970, Kristofferson release his debut self-titled album, supporting it with major shows at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, the Isle of Wight Festival in England, and the Bitter End in New York City. Even so, Kristofferson proved a critical and commercial failure. However, cover versions of his songs began to fill the country charts, including Waylon Jennings ’s version of “The Taker”—one of several songs co-written by Kristofferson and author Shel Silverstein — Jerry Lee Lewis ’s recording of “Once More with Feeling,” and Sammi Smith’s “Help Me Make It Through the Night.”  By the end of the year, Ray Price’s version of “For the Good Times” and Johnny Cash ’s rendition of “Sunday Morning Coming Down” had both reached No. 1 and crossed over into the pop Top 20. As “For the Good Times” was named Song of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, Kristofferson won his only Country Music Association Award when “Sunday Morin’ Comin’ Down” was similarly honored as Song of the Year. “Me and Bobby McGee” Kristofferson’s true musical breakthrough arrived in 1971 when Janis Joplin ’s posthumously released album, Pearl , featured her cover of “Me and Bobby McGee.” The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 that March and gave both Joplin and Kristofferson—who had been romantically involved for a time—their biggest hits ever. The song has since been recorded by many other artists over the years, including Kenny Rogers , Chet Atkins, Olivia Newton-John , and Dolly Parton . The smash success of “Me and Bobby McGee” helped boost sales of Kristofferson’s next album, The Silver Tongued Devil and I (1971) —which eventually became gold-certified—and prompted his label to rerelease his first album, this time with much greater results. Another 1971 album, Border Land , landed at No. 6 on Billboard ’s Top Country Albums chart. By the end of 1971, Kristofferson had gone from virtual obscurity to songwriting stardom. Three of his tunes competed in multiple categories, including the prestigious Song of the Year, at the following Grammy Awards . Kristofferson ultimately won Best Country Song for “Help Me Make It Through the Night” at the March 1972 awards show. Chart-Topping Albums and Songs The Grammy winner’s fourth album, Jesus Is a Capricorn (1972), was one of his most successful. Helped along by his first No. 1 country single, the Grammy-nominated “Why Me,” Jesus Is a Capricorn sold 500,000 copies and became a No. 1 country album in November 1973. Getty Images During the 1970s, when they were married, Rita Coolidge and Kris Kristofferson released three albums and performed together. This chapter of his professional life coincided with a new phase in his personal life. Having divorced his first wife, Kristofferson got remarried to fellow singer Rita Coolidge , and the pair recorded a successful string of duo albums. Their first, 1973’s Full Moon , shot to No. 1 on the country album chart. Kristofferson and Coolidge then earned two Grammy Awards for the duets “From the Bottle to the Bottom,” from Full Moon , and “Lover Please,” from 1974’s Breakaway . Both songs won Best Country Vocal Performance By A Duo Or Group. Kristofferson’s solo efforts around this time— Spooky Lady’s Sideshow (1974), Who’s to Bless and Who’s to Blame (1975), and Surreal Thing (1976)—were moderate wins but paled in comparison to the soundtrack for A Star Is Born (1976). The movie soundtrack, which heavily featured Kristofferson and his co-star Barbra Streisand , topped the Billboard 200 and was platinum-certified by January 1977. To date, it has sold more than 4 million copies. In the wake of this success, Kristofferson closed out the decade with the albums Easter Island (1978) and Shake Hands With the Devil (1979), as well as Natural Act (1978), the last duet album he recorded with Coolidge; they divorced soon after. Cover versions of his songs continued to find success, including those sung by fellow country singer Willie Nelson who went on to collaborate with Kristofferson on some of his most memorable work in the coming decade. The Highwaymen The 1980s and 1990s were a mix of highs and lows. Kristofferson continued releasing solo albums, such as To the Bone (1981), Third World Warrior (1990), and A Moment of Forever (1995), but his musical collaborations and movie soundtrack contributions bore the most fruit. The Winning Hand (1983 )—a joint album with Willie Nelson , Dolly Parton , and Brenda Lee —peaked at No. 4 on Billboard ’s Top Country Albums chart. Then, the soundtrack for the 1984 Nashville movie Songwriter earned Kristofferson, one of its stars, an Academy Award nomination for Best Music (Original Song Score). In 1985—the year Kristofferson was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame—he ventured out with country supergroup The Highwaymen that also featured Nelson, Johnny Cash , and Waylon Jennings . Their debut album, Highwayman , was released to great acclaim. The No. 1 country album produced several hit songs, including the Grammy-nominated title track, and eventually sold 1 million copies. Highwayman 2 (1990) resulted in another Grammy nomination, though their success dropped off with their final album, The Road Goes on Forever (1995). The Other Members of The Highwaymen Willie Nelson Johnny Cash Waylon Jennings Later Albums Between the late 1990s and as recently as 2022, Kristofferson largely released live albums, re-recordings, and records featuring unreleased songs. However, he didn’t abandon original music entirely. His 2006 album, This Old Road , marked his first new music collection in more than a decade. Three years later, Closer to the Bone arrived followed by the reflective Feeling Mortal in 2013. “Every album that I have done is what I am feeling at the time, for that age,” then-77-year-old said. “[ Feeling Mortal ] is about getting to the end of life. I have always thought of each album as what I have been growing through at the time.” The twilight of his music career also included some major honors. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A decade later, the Recording Academy presented him with its Lifetime Achievement Award, adding to his Grammy collection. He quietly retired in 2020 when he was in his mid-80s. The late singer is also the namesake of the Nashville Songwriters Association International’s highest accolade; the Kris Kristofferson Lifetime Achievement Award has been presented to Willie Nelson , Bill Anderson, Loretta Lynn , Garth Brooks , Bobby Braddock, and most recently Alan Jackson . Movies At the same time Kristofferson was making his name as a songwriter, he also began what proved to be a successful career as an actor. Beginning with the Dennis Hopper–directed drama The Last Movie (1971), Kristofferson appeared on the big screen as often as he released albums, at times even eclipsing his musical offerings with his films, to which he often contributed songs to as well. His credits during the early 1970s include a starring role opposite Gene Hackman in Cisco Pike (1972), his portrayal of Billy the Kid in Sam Peckinpah’s Pat Garret and Billy the Kid (1973), and a co-starring role opposite Ellen Burstyn in Martin Scorsese ’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974). A Star Is Born Getty Images Actor Kris Kristofferson won a Golden Globe for his performance as an aging rock star in A Star Is Born (1976). His 1976 appearances in Vigilante Force and The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea were quickly overshadowed by A Star Is Born . For that year’s remake, Kristofferson portrayed an aging rock star opposite Barbra Streisand ’s role as a singer on the rise. Panned by critics, A Star Is Born was nonetheless a box-office smash, and the soundtrack, which featured songs by the co-stars, was also a commercial success. Kristofferson ultimately won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role as John. A Star Is Born remained his most successful role for sometime. For much of the 1980s and early ’90s, Kristofferson appeared primarily in often-forgettable made-for-TV movies. His silver screen performances, including the ill-fated Heaven’s Gate (1980) and No Place to Hide (1992), were similarly uninspiring. This period also saw the actor star as a political dissident in the 1987 limited series Amerika about a hypothetical Soviet Union takeover of the United States. Lone Star In 1996, Kristofferson experienced yet another revival in his career when he was cast as the sheriff Charlie Wade in the acclaimed John Sayles movie Lone Star , which also featured Matthew McConaughey . Roles in more prominent films soon followed, with Kristofferson appearing in the Blade vampire movies, the family drama A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries (1998) , the Mel Gibson vehicle Payback (1999), and Tim Burton ’s Planet of the Apes (2001). Among his many later movies and TV roles were the 2012 indie drama The Motel Life and the 2016 western Traded . Wife and Children Getty Images Kris Kristofferson and his third wife, Lisa Meyers, were married for more than 41 years. Kristofferson was married to attorney Lisa Meyers for more than 41 years. They met at a gym, and when Meyers asked the double-threat to go for a run he initially turned her down, citing his single parenting duties and “complicated life.” Then still a law student, Meyers didn’t take no for an answer. “She said, ‘I just was asking you to go on a run. I wasn’t talking about changing your life,’” Kristofferson later told CBS News . “But she did, for the better.” The couple married on February 18, 1983. As they raised Kristofferson’s three children from his previous marriages, he and Meyers also had five kids of their own. Jesse, Jody, Johnny, Kelly, and Blake were born between 1983 to 1994. Beginning in 1990, the mostly lived on a large estate on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Kristofferson built the house back in the ’70s. Meyers was Kristofferson’s third wife. The star had been married to fellow singer Rita Coolidge from 1973 to 1980. Kristofferson and Coolidge met in 1972 during a TV appearance and became frequent professional collaborators, releasing three successful albums together that produced two Grammy-winning duets. In 1974, the couple had a daughter, Casey. Infidelity rumors plagued the marriage, which ended in divorce after seven years. Kristofferson’s first wife was his high school sweetheart Frances “Fran” Beer. They married in 1960, not long after Kristofferson returned to the United States with his master’s degree from Oxford University. The couple had a daughter named Tracy, born in 1962, then a son, Kris Jr., born in 1968. The family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, between the births of their children so Kristofferson could begin his music career. His slow start and tight finances increasingly added stress to the marriage, which ended in divorce in 1969. Declining Health In the early 2000s, the musician and actor was diagnosed with fibromyalgia , which caused painful muscle spasms that forced him to take eight months off work. Further health problems cropped up over the years, then Kristofferson lost his sense of smell, began having trouble with spatial awareness, and started to lose his memory. Around 2014, Kristofferson publicly revealed he was suffering from a form of dementia akin to Alzheimer’s, known as pugilistica, that doctors attributed to his time as a football player and boxer earlier in his life. However, it was ultimately a misdiagnosis. When a test for Lyme disease came back positive in February 2016, Kristofferson traded his Alzheimer’s and depression medication for three weeks of Lyme-disease treatment. His fibromyalgia was later attributed to his Lyme disease, which can cause muscle pain according to the Mayo clinic . Quotes I’ve come to appreciate how special a song is compared to other art forms, because you can carry it around in your head and your heart, and it remains part of you. I think God protects fools and songwriters. I have found that the clearer I get, the better my life around me has gotten. Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
