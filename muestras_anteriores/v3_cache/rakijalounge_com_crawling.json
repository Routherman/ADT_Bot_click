April 27, 2019 Goulash, beef stew, Shepherd’s Pie Stew… different names for the same delicious specialty we all love and cherish. Goulash is the most satisfying comfort food you need to have on your dinner table on a rainy and cold day. Nothing can quite keep you as warm as a generous bowl of steaming hot beef stew. It’s so delicious that we won’t even bore you with a history lesson and talk about its origin. Instead, we’ll just cut to the chase and provide you with the most mouth-watering goulash recipe combined with buttery-sweet mashed potato. How to Make Goulash Okay, so in order to make this recipe you’ll need the following ingredients: 1x tablespoon vegetable oil 1 lb / 0,5 kg  beef stewing meat, cut into 1-inch cubes 1x onion, chopped 2x sizeable carrots, sliced and halved 1x stalk of celery, finely chopped 2x bay leaves 2x garlic cloves, minced 2x tablespoons of all-purpose flour 2x tablespoons of tomato paste 1/2 cup of red wine 2x 1/2 cups of chicken stock 1x tablespoon of soy sauce 1x tablespoon of chopped parsley 1x teaspoon of chopped fresh thyme 1/2 pounds of premium Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes 1/2 stick of unsalted butter 1/4 cup of heavy cream salt and pepper to taste Take a large Dutch oven or any other cooking pot that’s large enough for making stew. Pour in the vegetable oil and heat it up on medium to high heat until it’s simmering. Add the meat and cook it for about 5 minutes on each side or until it’s browned. Take out the meat and add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook the mixture for about 10 minutes. You’ll know it’s done once it becomes soft and the aroma spreads throughout your kitchen. Add flour and stir it in until it’s evenly spread. Start gradually adding the tomato paste to the mixture, followed by wine. Simmer until the wine is completely reduced. Add chicken stock, bay leaves, chopped parsley, thyme, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and leave it for about half an hour. The texture should thicken up and become saucy. Meanwhile, start making your creamy mashed potatoes. Throw the 3/4-inch potato cubes into a large pot of cold water and add salt. Boil them for about 10-15 minutes. The best way to check if the potatoes are ready for mashing is to take a fork and gently poke them. If they are fork-tender, they are ready. Drain the potatoes through a colander and return them to the pan. Stir them for a couple of minutes to get rid of any remaining water. This will also keep them warm. Take a potato masher and use some elbow grease to get that silky smooth, beautiful texture. Melt the unsalted butter and gradually add it to the mashed potatoes until it’s fully incorporated. Finally, add the heavy cream little by little and stir it in. Season to taste. So, now that you have your stew and mashed potatoes done, it’s time to serve it. Take a generous spoon of potatoes and serve it in a bowl. Pour the steaming hot beef stew over the top and watch it as it perfectly mixes together. Serve warm. Enjoyed making this flavorsome recipe?

It is like a U.N. peace party with music, food and booze. Croatians, Bulgarians and Bosnians meet and mingle. First-timers often tell the owners they have not tasted home in ten years. A tiki hut encloses the bar and you can enjoy a hookah post-meal. Owners Miroslav Banjac and his wife Maria are both Serbs from Bosnia, met working on a Carnival cruise ship and relocated to Miami Beach. The Rakija Lounge menu offers salads, burgers, wraps, pasta, pizza and steaks but you come for the Serbian specialties served every day not just Tuesday. START WITH THESE DISHES For Balkans, it is mandatory to toast before eating, clinking small glasses of rakija (ra-kee-ya) brandy made from apricots, plums, pears or quince sipped as an aperitif. After that order ustipci, a type of doughnut that resembles a short fat churro served with kajmak (buttery clotted cream). Ustipci, a doughnut that resembles a short fat churro served with kajmak (buttery clotted cream) at Rakija Lounge. IMG SOURCE: MIAMI HERALD There’s also burek, a snail-shaped pastry made with layers of butter-brushed phyllo dough stuffed with a mixture of feta and cottage cheese. It comes with small cups of kajmak and ajvar. Ajvar is a thick roasted red pepper and eggplant spread laced with garlic. It is red-orange with a smoky, spicy, sweet taste, good on the rustic house-made pita baked to order. Or go with shopska, a chopped salad with feta cheese dressed in olive oil with oregano. Non-Serb starters include avocado toast, shrimp cocktail and fried calamari. SHARE THESE DISHES Cevapi are all-beef finger sausages seasoned with salt and pepper grilled over low heat served in pita with diced onion, kajmak and ajvar. The mixed grill adds on sudzukice, a type of Balkan sausage resembling a long thin hot dog made from beef and veal. Plejeskavica are very thin flat burger patties that come in pita. To try a dish named after a former ruling dynasty try the karadjordjeva schnitzel. Flat, pounded chicken or pork cutlets are rolled up with kajmak and mozzarella, breaded and pan-fried served with fries, tartar sauce and lemon slices. Sarma brings plump ground beef and rice stuffed brined cabbage leaves steamed in tomato sauce with a drift of mashed potatoes—Balkan comfort food. Sarma, beef and rice stuffed cabbage leaves in tomato sauce with mashed potatoes. IMG SOURCE: MIAMI HERALD Alexandria Riesling made in Macedonia pairs well with grilled meats or seafood. It has an aroma of honey and citrus with complex floral flavors and sweet finish. It is not on the wine list so ask.

Bringing our traditions, food, humor, and signature drink from our country was an ambitious task, but also an enjoyable one. Now, we’re aiming for new adventures with our new establishment. You can expect a menu enriched with flavorful dishes and even more types of Rakija for you to sip and enjoy. HOW IT ALL BEGAN? It all began with a couple of dreamers who had a clear idea and were determined to make it a reality. Once we acquainted ourselves with the diverse American culture and its blend of culinary traditions from different countries and continents, we knew there was room for our own cuisine to prosper and flourish. We had a solid foundation, family recipes passed on from generation to generation, and we had a signature drink – the famous Rakija, an alcoholic beverage with a distinctive smell and taste that’s quickly becoming more and more popular thanks to the success of our Rakija Grill restaurant. Join us on our journey as we open up a new chapter in our culinary endeavors. BOOK HERE WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY From the awesome hostess, to the amazing waitress, to the absolutely delicious food and drinks we were very impressed with everything about Rakija lounge! Thank you! Bella Barecatt Can’t begin to tell you how friendly and kind staff and owners are. My best friend and I stumbled upon this place. Please visit! Food and drinks are amazing….music is spot on and the atmosphere is relaxing and inviting! Tammy Parker Landis Limetree is amazing! Great food, great drinks, and such a great atmosphere. If you’re thinking about having some great Balkan food this is the place to go! So delicious. Sejla Karovic This is the best place that we visit during our vacation. Great food, very friendly and customer oriented staff, makes this place a champion in the area. We enjoyed dinner and recommend – if you in Miami Beach, definitely visit this restaurant. Yakov Geller When we came up with the idea to open a Serbian restaurant in Miami Beach, we were set on a couple of things. We wanted to offer our guests a warm and relaxing environment where they can feel at home and we wanted to introduce them to a Balkan cuisine that's rich not only in flavor, but in tradition as well.

Jokes aside, hookah is a rather important device in the smoking and vaping culture, so let’s delve a bit deeper into hookah history, origin, and culture. Though hookah is the most widely spread and used name for this smoking device, it goes by many other different names around the world. Some of them include nargeela, nargile, narghile, shisha, sheesha, okka, kalyan, ghelyoon, ghalyan, goza, hubble-bubble, etc. Most of these expressions are of Somalian, Arab, Ethiopian, Indian, Turkish or Persian origin. According to most testimonies, stories, and writings, hookah reached its full potential in India, while some people claim it was actually invented in Persia. What Does Hookah Mean? The term hookah is derived from the word haqqa, which means “pot, jar” and “cavity, hollow.” Though it goes by many names, as we mentioned above, people in the U.S. like to refer to this type of smoking device as shisha. This is, however, incorrect as shisha refers only to the glass base of this instrument, but the term did catch on. Hookah History and Culture Hookah, in the form it exists today, was invented around the 15th century in India. It all started when the Indian glass manufacturing business started to bloom because the British East India Company began exporting glass to India. The culture and the mystique behind this device soon spread to Iran where people started using hookahs to smoke Ajami, a flavorless but strong type of tobacco. During the Ottoman Empire reign, hookah really took off. The Ottoman sultans even insisted on taking portraits with their hookahs. It became somewhat of a status symbol and important people liked to smoke out of it at diplomatic meetings and royal dinners. Parts of Hookah and How it Works A typical hookah consists of several components, each of them equally important for a perfect hookah experience. The uppermost part is called the bowl or the hookah head; this is where the coal and the tobacco is held during the smoking session. Then there are the tray, the stem, release valve, hose gasket, hose port (where the hose goes in), hose, vase gasket, vase (water base); and in that order form up to bottom. Some hookahs have a windscreen that is used to cover the bowl area and keep the wind from ruining your hookah experience by making the coal burn too quickly. How it Works The vase (or water base) is filled with water so the down stem is submerged. Perforated metal screen or foil sheet is then used to cover the bowl. Hot pieces of coal are then placed on top of the foil sheet so the tobacco in the bowl can heat up to an appropriate temperature. When the user starts sucking the air through the hose, more heat is then drawn on the tobacco, which enables and accelerate the transfer of heat. By drawing air through the hose, the smoke is being sent down through the down stem and underwater. Subsequently, the smoke goes up above the water surface in the water base and into the opening of the hose port, which is connected directly to the hose port. The smoke then continues to flow through the hose and reaches the mouth of a user. Hookah Smoking Tips & Tricks Spread the coil evenly across the foil so the tobacco would burn more consistently. Add about 2 inches of wine into the vase for enhanced flavor. Add some citrus fruit (lemon, orange, mango, grapefruit) to the water for fruity sensation. Add ice cubes to vase water for ice-cold smoking sensation. We hope you enjoyed our hookah history lesson. What are your hookah-related experiences?

We take many steps to achieve the ultimate goal; – make our place so comfortable that the guests feel like a family. Two weeks ago, we read the best review we ever got! And we are beyond happy if everyone who enters Rakija Lounge feels the same as Aleks Chonevski. Take a look at his detailed and unique review of Rakija Lounge. Rakija unified people The Rakija Lounge is in the heart of South Beach’s art deco district. When you enter the lounge, you hear accents. Voices in different languages such as Macedonian, Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, Bulgarian, and English – the first question is always in English, asking where you are from, and then the second sentence immediately switches into a familiar Balkan language as though they’ve known each other forever. The manager, Bogdan, will enthusiastically welcome you and is everywhere with everyone; he never stops keeping an eye on everything. There is a proverb: “Satisfied customers always come back.” He appears to know everyone, and his patrons always return. Marko, the bartender, asked me what he could do for me in English, however since Bogdan was there, he gave Marko a better suggestion in Serbian, instead of a whisky, make me one of Rakija Lounge’s signature drinks, an old-fashion. This drink was so good that I had three. After their signature drink, I was served the best cevapi with pita bread, onion, and kajmak (goat cheese) before partaking in Balkan-style baklava. The VIP section was packed with beautiful Balkans, delicious food, hookahs, and happy faces. Around 10 pm, the Rakija Lounge and patio were packed. Serbian music from the 80s and 90s never stopped while patrons sang at the bar and patio tables, all thanks to cool vibes from DJ Vlad. The thrilling atmosphere warmed Balkan hearts, while DJ Vlad’s songs appealed to everyone, not only Balkan but international tourists and local Floridians. I came back the following week for a business meeting. This time I went with my Macedonian and Serbian friends. The service continued to be exceptional. Our server was an educated Albanian woman who was fast and friendly. She served an exquisite Balkan wine along with excellent mixed grill plates of kajmak, pita bread, ustipci (a blend of chopped meats wrapped around cheese), Shopska (Balkan-styled salads), and Macedonian and Serbian beers. Our entire meal was so delicious and tasted as good as back home. The Rakija Lounge is a fantastic and unique place to hear international music and listen to stories as you meet and connect with Balkan guests and locals. This lounge is one of the best places in south Florida to visit , and stress will float away after a few shots of rakija. I look forward to seeing the Word Soccer Match with my hybrid Balkan buddies, eating delicious authentic Balkan food, feeling pampered by the excellent service, and relaxing in the cozy atmosphere. Thank you, Rakija staff. Aleks Chonevski The team of Rakija Lounge wants to address a huge thank you and a round of applause for this thorough review describing our place as it is.

April 12, 2019 Smoking hookah is becoming more popular by the day, so, consequently, more and more flavors are being introduced to the market. With so many brands and flavors to choose from, picking the right one for you has become virtually impossible without reading pages and pages of reviews. Luckily, we’ve done that for you and summarized it in this article. If you’re curious which hookah flavors are top rated at the moment, keep on reading. 5 Best Hookah Flavors in 2019 Al Fakher Mint Back in the day when shisha was not as popular, aside from a few fruit flavored products, mint dominated the market. When considering what brand offers the most authentic mint-flavored tobacco, only one name comes to mind – Al Fakher. Al Fakher Mint is the synonym for mint-flavored shisha and for a good reason. Every time you imagine yourself lounging and blowing thick, milky clouds into the air, it’s like you can literally visualize the taste of this hugely popular product. It might be the first product on our list, but it’s safe to say it’s the most iconic shisha flavor of them all. Fumari Ambrosia This next one is a pretty unique tasting hookah tobacco and can be found only in select stores and bars. As the slogan, Ambrosia from Fumari is strikingly fresh. The name and taste are inspired by the ingredients found in the Ambrosia fruit salad. A subtle blend of melon and pineapple, combined with a citrusy-like taste of oranges and mandarin. The aroma is topped off with a sweet marshmallow-like finish. Starbuzz Pirate’s Cave Ever wondered what would Mountain Dew shisha taste like? Well, Pirate’s Cave from Starbuzz is probably the closest you can get to tasting this citrus-flavored soda in a hookah. The initial aroma notes have refreshing lime in it, followed by a candy-like taste. Sweet and sour at it’s best! Nakhla Double Apple Those who love keeping it old school and enjoying traditional-style hookah tobacco, the well-known Double Apple (or Two Apple) from Nakhla Tobacco should be their choice. Keeping the original recipe ever since it hit the market, the Double Apple has become a staple part of every shisha lover’s collection. The unwashed dark leaf tobacco used in the production of this flavor does have a higher percentage of nicotine, so expect to feel a small buzz after a few whiffs. Starbuzz Blue Mist Lastly, we have another one from Starbuzz and probably the most popular product on this list – the Starbuzz Blue Mist. Starbuzz is an established brand that’s been gracing the shisha market with flawless products for years, but no other product has left a mark as the Blue Mist did. A perfect combination of an authentic sweet blueberry with just a pinch of cool mint to give it that spicy aftertaste. Blue Mist is made of washed blonde leaf tobacco known for having a low percentage of nicotine. Have you tried some of the products from this list before? Let us know in the comments if you agree with our list and if we left out your favorite flavor. Are you interested in smoking some of the highest-quality tobacco? Then be sure to visit our hookah bar , Rakija Lounge, located in South Beach, Miami. Make sure to keep up with our blog and stay updated on the latest articles about tasty food, even tastier drinks, and delicious hookah flavors. Please note this blog is for informational purposes and that Rakija Lounge only serves Starbuzz hookah flavors. hookah flavors Facebook 0 Post navigation Previous post What Is Slivovitz and How Is It Made?
