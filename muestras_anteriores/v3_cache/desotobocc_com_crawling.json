Down to earth and friendly. Bathrooms and trash cans tended well. Springs with fossil finds! All the sites are pretty close together but unless it's crowded I didn't care. Plenty of big trees on every site for cover, and if you don't mind wandering in the woods, there's lots of potential to gather firewood. They do offer bundles of cut/dried for a reasonable price. Site 14 Month of Visit February Share Report Chad N. Guide Reviewed Jan. 12, 2022 Small but nice This place was nice and quiet. We stayed for NYE weekend and we had a lot of fun and met some really great people. The  water is ripe with sulfur so it smells like eggs but no biggie. The kayak and canoe launch was a couple miles north and then you paddle back to the site. It's a nice paddle with a lot of gators on the banks. You can also dig for fossils along the banks and find some cool shark teeth. I'd visit again. Month of Visit January (10) View All Share Report J Jennifer Q. Scout Reviewed Jan. 2, 2022 Last minute trip with the kids Beautiful and quiet, we found a secluded spot. So close to the river! Month of Visit January Share Report B M. Legend Reviewed Jun. 3, 2020 Small campground good fossiling We have stayed here several times last time was site #9 it's big with water, electric, picnic table, cement pad & fire pit. This is a nice site other than a bright light that's on at the firewood storage area. The restrooms are small & not cleaned a lot if the camp host is there Thursday-Sunday they are cleaned. The Canoe outpost launches canoes & picks up canoes going or coming up or down the river. Some people take long trips & primitive camp along the way back to the campground. There is a boat ramp, and a dump station here. They take cash or checks only. They say the campground is full a lot & it's never full when were there. The outside sites have water & electric, the inside sites have no hook up. They are supposed to change that. Lots of Hawks here Owls & some deer. You can kayak or canoe the river & find fossils or walk right off the campground into the Peace River & fossil there. People have sifters they make and zip tie foam noodles around them so they float. Shovel in sand & gravel & look for fossils. They find Prehistoric sharks, gator, horse, Megalodon, Mammoth teeth & tusks, Glyptodon (giant Armadillo body armor, Tapir teeth and much more. You can get a Florida fossil license for $5.00 a year. mail it in in advance. We sit in the river & fossil, it's so much fun.  Yes there are gators if we see big ones we move on. Otherwise when you put your shovel in the water/sand it makes noise they usually move away. Arcadia is a cute town if you like to Antique there's a great Nautical/other shop in town. We have also stayed in site #  11 which is nice #12 is good to. There can be some groups camping together in sites but usually not to loud. Solomon's Castle is close by it's a neat place to visit, have a drink & an appetizer or dessert.

Felt like we were in on a secret getting to stay here. Concrete pads, fire pit with grill grate and separate charcoal grill at the 12 sites with full hookups (didn’t check the water-only sites). We ended up staying a Saturday night while some folks were celebrating a birthday. They were a bit loud, but calmed down at quiet time. Rest of our stay was sooooo quiet and we barely encountered other folks. Wish I would’ve had a kayak with me! Call in advance to make a reservation (they’re constantly working the grounds, so leave a message), although there were extra sites open each night we were there, so you could try just showing up. Pick your own site when you arrive (12 looks to be the best but 11 also has some water view), and the host will come by to collect dues. We bought firewood for a real decent price and got SO much. Hosts checked on us a few times to make sure everything was alright, tell us about the trails and where we could gather more wood, and see if we need anything. Bathrooms weren’t the greatest, but eh. We’ll definitely stay again if in the area.

This park is lovely with 24 sites. Some with electric for $32. The park managers now live here full time and go over and above to make your stay wonderful. Most sites have large live oak trees for shade. The park is on the Peace River and it is enjoyable to search for fossils. Karen the manager will loan you the equipment. The restrooms could use an update but I’ve seen worse. Shower water is hot. Right now there are just two sites occupied. There is some day use but not a problem. Arcadia is not far for eating out.

Fossil hunting is good here using a sifter, shovel & a small mesh bag to put your fossils in. Usually the campground isn't busy there are always many empty sites. We had a big site with a fire pit, table, cement pad, water & electric & there is a dump station.  The water does smell like sulfur so take bottled water to drink, make coffee or tea with. The bathrooms are cleaned when the camp host is there but during the week it's not cleaned and there are a lot of people that use the day use area to fossil hunt. We don't use the bathrooms so no problem for us. The canoe outpost rents canoes & offers several places they will take you & drop you off & you canoe down the river, even camp along the way if you want. The bus pulling a canoe trailer drops people off every morning several times and they canoe back to the outpost. You do hear the bus coming in everyday with rumbling canoes but it's not that bad. We found fossilized horse teeth, gator teeth, sharks teeth some nice ones on occasion, tapir teeth, dugong bones, other bones, turtle & Glyptodon (giant armadillo armor body plates and more). There is a small town Arcadia close by and a neat place called Solomon's Castle good for a cold beer & lunch.

Park is nicely shaded and is pretty clean. The bathrooms are not very good at all. They are very dirty. We camped in our travel trailer. The water has a very bad sulfur smell to it. And the power was surging very badly. We were going to stay longer but not at the risk of tearing up or AC unit from surging power. Park was very quiet and had a nice boat ramp on the Peace River. We did canoe from the park down to Arcadia. There is a canoe Outfitter in Arcadia that will bring you up to the Brownsville Park and you can paddle down to Arcadia. I would stay here again but only in the winter time where I did not have to use power to run the AC.

The campground is under a oak hammock, well shade. Busy at the weekends when the local outdoor company bring buses of people to launch down the river. Very popular between locals to spend the weekend on the river. The worst was the bathroom. Not clean and only one shower. Short trails along the river for walk. Peace river is beautiful. This is a convenient place to enjoy it. We were in a tent place with table and fire place.

He started yelling at us for going too fast but we were only going 10 mph. I am hearing impaired and had to ask him to repeat a few things and in turn, took that as we were being rude and began to threaten me and my fiancé. We will not be coming back to this campground to be disrespected the way we were for absolutely no reason. Edit Note Delete Note Helpful 0 Be the first to add a video for Brownville Park! Add Video!
