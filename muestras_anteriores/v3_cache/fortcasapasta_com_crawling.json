About Pasta Evangelists Pasta makes everything feel better. So why not make pasta taste better? Inspired by this simple mission, our founder Alessandro set out to bring the freshness and quality of the freshly made, pastificio-style pasta he grew up making by hand with his nonna in Italy to British kitchens. Meet our founders Alessandro Savelli Founder & CEO The man with the idea. Favourite fresh pasta? Trofie, from his native Liguria. Chris Rennoldson Co-founder, VP Strategy & Analytics The numbers guy. Favourite fresh pasta? Spaghetti alla chitarra, from Abruzzo. Finn Lagun co-founder & CMO The creative one. Favourite fresh pasta? Orecchiette, from Puglia. Meet our chefs Giancarlo Perbellini Executive Chef The 3 Michelin-starred chef behind our dishes. Favourite pasta dish? Spaghetti with fresh bottarga and lemon. Roberta D’elia HEAD PASTAIA (PASTA ARTISAN) The woman behind our fresh pasta renaissance. Favourite pasta dish? Orecchiette alle cime di rapa, from her native Puglia. Explore our favourite recipes Reminding us of holidays spent along the Amalfi Coast, our lobster tortelloni (tortelloni all’aragosta) are individually finished by hand Pasta ‘alla carbonara’ is not merely a crowd pleaser: it is an integral part of the Roman experience and chapter in the Eternal City’s story Our ragù al cinghiale – wild boar ragù – is simmered for several hours, as in the Tuscan tradition, with exotic aromats like juniper Pistachios are known as the ‘green gold’ in Sicily, in recognition of their beauty but also expensiveness. We use them to make a vibrant pesto Wild mushrooms are important in the gastronomy of Northern Italy. In great reverence, our chefs feature several varieties in this special sauce Our pasta Pasta has been freshly made on the Italian peninsula for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Chef d’Elia honours this tradition by preparing our fresh pasta artisanally, using the finest Italian flour and finishing some of our favourite shapes, tortelloni for instance, by hand. No one piece is quite like another. “Altro il vino non è se non la luce del sole mescolata con l’umido della vite.” “Wine is nothing but sunlight mixed with the humidity of the vine.” Although Galileo was talking about viniculture, his quip reminds us of the centrality of nature, and the quality of its produce, in the most beautiful moments of life. Selecting the best ingredients and treating them with respect is the guiding principle of Pasta Evangelists Executive Chef, Giancarlo Perbellini. Our ingredients Chef Perbellini and his team use ingredients of the highest calibre to prepare our dishes. Where possible, we source from local producers here in the UK. That said, there are some questions in gastronomy to which Italy alone has an answer, meaning some products are judiciously sourced from il bel paese to bring you the very best.
