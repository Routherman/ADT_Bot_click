Being a Realtor at the time gave Joe some insight on the growth potential of the Emerald Coast and the value of having a second home that he could rent. He soon purchased more rentals and then started helping his real estate clients from Cincinnati purchase in Destin also. After the opportunity to sell his family health club and supplement website, Joe decided to go full time into the vacation rental business. Joe and his family were also featured on “House Hunters International” when his involvement in an Ocean Front Villa community became popular in Panama. Joe now owns rentals in Destin and manages properties for some friends. He also started the online vacation rental software site ivacationonline.com. Helping private owners run vacation rentals has become a passion for Joe. He is the author of “Vacation Rentals For Profit”. He gives seminars on the subject and has always been a leader in vacation rental marketing innovation. With over 20 years of experience in Real Estate, Web Development and Vacation Rentals, Joe was driven to bring back to the market, a traditional listing site for private owners and managers. Wanting to concentrate on a regional basis for optimal growth in one area is how EmeraldCoastByOwner.com was born!

July 2025 Visited Station RV in the last part of June. The staff was fantastic!! Laundry and shower facilities were top notch and the laundry accepted credit cards for convenience. The pool was perfect and very clean. They have an outdoor kitchen area with grill, griddle, refrigerator, and ice maker. Nice pickleball court, cornhole area and bocce ball area. The store has essential items in the event you forgot something of your own. Fast food and fuel is less than half mile away. Very quiet camping also. Ron F. June 2025 Great place if you want amenities, relaxation, peace and quiet. Personnel are warm and friendly. Pool was clean and refreshing. Bath houses and Laundry were impeccable. This is definitely our go to place to stay when we are in the area. Bill C. June 2025 We stayed over Memorial Day weekend. The park is brand new. Very well manicured. It has a pool and other activities. The area, however, doesn’t have a lot to do if you’re looking for a great place to stop along I10 this is a good place. We did drive into the city of Madison. Not much there. Just saw they are offering now a summer discount. It’s well worth the price at the discount rate. Wish we had that offer available when we stayed. We will stay here again in the area. Mark M. May 2025 Brand new RV park with all the amenities. Staff was friendly, kind and helpful with curb side service. Concrete new pads and long enough for toad. Must stop if ya'll need one prior to entering into Florida or on way back from south Florida. Easy on/off. Quiet. We will add this Park to our travel list. Daniel S. April 2025 My wife and I rented one of the campers at The Station while staying in Madison. We have an RV so are acquainted with RV living. We loved the park and thought it was fantastic. The staff was super friendly and attentive and helped us out tremendously when my wife’s baggage was lost. We would stay there again without any hesitation in either their rental camper or our RV.

Short drive to the beach. Site 69 Month of Visit March Share Report T Tommie C. Scout Reviewed Jan. 10, 2022 Beautiful campground DISHONEST MANAGER JULIE Beware of your billing. They will over charge you. Just a FYI to my camping friends. We are staying at Sun Outdoors Panama City Beach. While it’s a beautiful place with lots of amenities, don’t pay extra for the LOCK SITE. We have had a reservation for over 6 months and paid the Lock Fee for Site 73. We cancelled one night on the end of our stay within there guidelines. Julie, THE MANAGER, sent us an updated bill. She increased the lock fee to$50, increased the price of each night stay AND CHANGED OUR SITE. When I called her she did cancel the site lock fee and corrected the price per night but told us SITE 73 is under construction and she had to switch a lot of people around because of it. We get here and Site 73 is not under construction and she gave it to someone else. I sent her a message and ask her why she did that and she won’t respond. BEWARE OF YOUR CHARGES AT THIS PARK. UPDATE: She issued us 10% credit for not getting the Site we chose that she moved us. THE POINT IS YOU ABSOLUTELY LIED AND DID NOT FOLLOW YOUR RULES AND POLICY.

Highly recommend! Share Report Mike H. Scout Reviewed Dec. 2, 2019 Absolutely awesome By far one of the best campgrounds we have ever stayed in, everything is clean and well kept. Share Report Susan L. Traveler Reviewed Jul. 7, 2019 Nice, clean, friendly RV park with lots of amenities! Great for families, ESPECIALLY w/kids and pets. Well kept by staff.  Of RV parks I’ve stayed at, this one is priced at comparable rates but you have more amenities.  It’s conviently located to the attractions and beach.  The only thing I would prefer is more space between sites and more shaded sites. If you like a more natural and private setting, I wouldn’t recommend this park. See pics below for site spacing.

Guest Testimonials Emerald Isle RV Resort 4.5 out of 5 stars Anna Maria Bach Pedrocchi 5 out of 5 stars posted 2 weeks ago Absolutely recommendable! We were there with an RV, the campsite had a gorgeous lawn. When booking, make sure that the site has a sewer if you need one. Not all of them have one. The toilets were very clean and the showers spacious. The location of the Resort is amazing with direct access to the beach. The beach is very natural and the water clear. The swimming pool area was very inviting, nice and clean and is open until 8 pm. The resort is lively and in perfect shape. The Office staff was very helpful and attentive. We had a great time there! Jennifer Corriveau 5 out of 5 stars posted 1 month ago Visited for my sister's wedding. Resort is oceanfront with bath houses and laundry area. Playground for the kids and a pavilion for concerts and events. There is also a pool. We didn't stay there but my sister and her husband love it and we visited their RV.
