Personal Data We Collect About You and Why. 4. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies. 5. Online Analytics and Advertising. 6. Information We Disclose. 7. International Users. 8. Your Data Rights and Choices. 9. Notice to California Residents. 10. Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR. 11. Data Security and Integrity. 12. Retention and Removal. 13. Right to Revise. 14. Contact Details. 15. Privacy Contacts. Introduction; Scope of this Policy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Governmentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, \"Schooljobs\", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use . Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in the Terms of Use . Any dispute related to privacy is subject to the Terms of Use and this Policy, including limitations on liability. This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion. We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below. Where We Are a Service Provider Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information or your precise geolocation information for timeclock tracking, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a \"data processor\" or \"service provider\" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Any use of analytics or engagement technologies that process personal data, including tools that analyze user behavior or associate usage with identifiers, are implemented solely as a data processor or service provider in these scenarios, and such data is not used by NEOGOV for its own commercial purposes. Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you. For example, a Customer may choose to enable collection of biometric or precise location data for its employees using our time and attendance product. We process such data only at the direction of that Customer and do not use it for our own purposes. Further, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services. Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer. Personal Data We Collect About You and Why. In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.

For more information on Cookies see the “Cookies and similar Tracking Technologies; “Do Not Track” section immediately below. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include: A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things. HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Microsoft Edge , Google Chrome , Mozilla Firefox , or Apple Safari ). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. In some cases, we may also associate analytics and usage data with identifiers such as your name or email address, but only as needed to enable our Customers to analyze user engagement, feature usage, or onboarding effectiveness. These tools are used solely on behalf of our Customers to support the Services they direct us to provide.  For example, we use Gainsight to support in-product analytics and engagement, on behalf of our Customers, and subject to our role as a service provider.

Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing. Lawful Basis for Processing. For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including: Consent. In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy. Legitimate Interest. We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests. Performance of a Contract We process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service. Other Legal Bases. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims. Automated Decision Making and Profiling. We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you. Data Security and Integrity. We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us. Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password. Retention and Removal. For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law. Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements.

The new Team Tourism initiative is a year-round informational program to bring together the VCB staff, industry partners and community leaders for two purposes:  1) to strengthen teamwork throughout the destination, and 2) to empower travel industry leaders to maximize marketing opportunities available to them. \"To succeed in today's exceedingly competitive marketplace, we need a renewed emphasis on teamwork,\" said VCB executive director Suya Davenport. \"Breaking down silos, pooling our resources and strengthening our collaborative efforts across the destination will help our marketing outreach sing with one voice and achieve maximum efficiencies.  That's what Team Tourism is all about.\" The program expands upon educational workshops that the VCB rolled out earlier this year and were met with resounding industry accolades. The presentations addressed how to participate in Florida's certified green lodging program, secrets of effective vacation packaging, guidelines and tips for successful cooperative marketing and other topics. Given the success of these previously held programs, the VCB plans to continue quarterly Team Tourism programming on a variety of topics to help tourism industry partners increase their marketing effectiveness. Whatever the topic, Davenport says Team Tourism will provide increased information from expert sources – all to make the day-to-day jobs of industry marketers more productive. The next Team Tourism program is scheduled for Jan. 21, 2009, when the VCB will present a workshop to discuss the destination brand and how industry partners can piggyback their efforts onto the VCB's for greater collaborative marketing outreach to target audiences. Future programs will follow later next year. Team Tourism also is an outgrowth of the VCB's new leadership platform, which Davenport simultaneously unveiled during today's Summit. The platform stresses a collaborative style that unites diverse constituents that is based on two simple cornerstones – teamwork and a customer-centric approach. \"Our renewed emphasis on these two basic principles will help us maintain the destination's well-earned reputation for long-range vision, strategic thinking and innovative leadership,\" said Davenport. \"Our destination is facing challenges from shifts in supply and demand and room inventory as well as the tight economy and increased competition. That means we have to be more customer-centric than ever before to win our share of visitors, and it means we need to work together at new levels.\" Davenport added that unveiling the new Team Tourism program caused the VCB to change the format for its annual meeting. The brand new format – a full day of expert speakers and workshops – adds an educational component to the VCB's traditional approach to this event. It allows for sharing the latest travel industry developments from renowned experts while simultaneously providing a platform for introducing the VCB's annual marketing plan. Davenport invites input on potential speakers and topics for future Team Tourism programs from members of the area's tourism community. Suggestions can be sent to sdavenport@leegov.com or (800) 237-6444. For details and a summary of the Team Tourism Summit presentations, visit www.leevcb.com . Printable Version"

Our programs — located in more than 350 parks, recreation centers, and public schools across New York City — reach 285,000 people each year. Our ethos is simple: thriving parks mean thriving communities. More than 30 Years of Bringing Parks to Life In 1989, Kramer vs. Kramer author Avery Corman was concerned about the state of the park near where he had grown up in the Bronx, so he began looking for ways to improve it. Thanks to Avery, and many other dedicated New Yorkers who took action at a critical time in our city’s history, City Parks Foundation now reaches 285,000 New Yorkers every year, offering programming to encourage residents to use and care for their local parks and green spaces. Over the years, we have grown to meet community needs, adding such notable programs as CityParks tennis — now the largest municipal tennis instruction program for kids in the country — and SummerStage — our city’s largest free outdoor performing arts festival. But we have not forgotten our roots, because we know that our city’s parks are always improved when New Yorkers get involved. Our city’s parks are the most fundamentally democratic of public spaces, available for anyone and everyone to use for recreation, for enjoyment, for relaxation, for community gathering, for environmental benefits, and for so much more. We are honored to partner with and serve New Yorkers of all ages — attending concerts together, learning yoga in our seniors fitness program, getting out on a rowboat with classmates to learn about our waterways, or volunteering to beautify a local playground — who are all focused on a singular goal: to bring these public spaces to life. Board & Staff Contact Us Press Room City Parks Foundation Programs Presenting World Class Performances in Your Neighborhood CityParks Shows brings hundreds of live music, dance and theater performances to communities throughout New York City’s five boroughs with Capital One City Parks Foundation SummerStage , the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre , and the traveling PuppetMobile .
