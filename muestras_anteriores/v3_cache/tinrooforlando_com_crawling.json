Metal Roofing Panel and Sheet FAQs What are Metal Roofing Panels and Sheets? Metal roofing panels and metal roofing sheets are terms commonly used to describe steel and aluminum products used for metal roofing or other building cladding purposes. These products are manufactured in a process called roll-forming. Roll-forming progressively bends flat strips of metal into a range of different product shapes. Forming metal into panels imparts strength, performance, shape, and form to the metal roofing panel. In the roll-forming process, Metal roofing panels are manufactured from a continuous strip of metal, enabling panels to be cut at precise lengths specific to project requirements. What Are The Main Differences in Metal Roofing Panels? The two most common types of metal roofing panels are concealed fastened panels and exposed fastener panels. Key differences include: Concealed fastener metal roofing panels , such as standing seam roofing, conceal the fasteners once installed. This provides a cleaner look and improved performance by reducing the fastener’s exposure to the elements. Generally, these metal roofing panels are more complex to install and feature narrower panel coverage that contributes to a higher installed cost. The most common application of concealed fastener metal roofing panels is residential and commercial roofing. Exposed fastener metal roofing panels are attached to the building by drilling through the panel. This allows for a faster installation process. These panels are generally wider and shipped in nested bundles, which contributes to lower transport costs and installation costs. The most common applications of exposed fastener metal roofing panels are metal buildings and agricultural structures. Within each of these product groups, metal roofing panels can vary in terms of coverage (width), and the angle, repeat, and depth of panel ribs. Panel rib design can influence panel strength and the prominence of shadow lines. What Are Important Metal Roofing Panel Product Options? Outside of the product design, most metal roofing panels will have the following product options: Color and paint system – Metal Panels are available in different colors to meet different design criteria and may also be available in different paint systems. Paint systems can vary from good to excellent and influence performance, warranty coverage, and cost. Metal thickness –Known as gauge, metal roofing panels are typically offered in two or three different gauges. Metal thickness will directly influence the strength, weight, and cost of the metal panel. Other panel-specific options – Metal roofing panels with large flat areas, such as standing seam metal roofing panels, may have options including striations or pencil ribs. These subtle accents can help avoid unintentional waviness associated with light-gauge sheet metal known as oil canning . How Do I Install Metal Roofing Panels and Sheets? Each metal roofing panel will have a distinctive installation approach and require care and precision. Installing panels and trims in the correct order, selecting the appropriate fastener placement and pressure, and using correct sealants and closures are all important considerations for a long-lasting metal roofing panel installation. We publish comprehensive metal panel installation guides backed by in-depth YouTube videos to make metal panel installation straightforward. ASC Building Products offers a range of trims and flashings , color-matched fasteners , and accessory products such as light panels , to ensure there is a complete solution for every metal roofing or siding project.

This is the Tin Roof Bistro. The inside is decorated like an Italian villa, painted with warm creamy hues and accented with a tin-paneled ceiling. Wooden tables and bistro chairs abound and wine bottle light fixtures dangle above a long mahogany bar. Outside, guests can enjoy a picturesque fountain courtyard, or play a game of bocce ball. Though the scene is set for an exclusively Italian experience, the Tin Roof Bistro offers an exceedingly multinational menu. Sure, there is no shortage of wine offerings and there’s fresh pizza coming out of the flaming brick oven, but you can just as easily order an excellent dinner of fish ‘n’ chips, spicy tuna spring rolls, or a lamb burger. To say that the menu is regionally well-represented would be an understatement, which makes it all the more enticing! For private events, the bistro offers it’s lovely wine cellar for intimate dining, or the outdoor patio for an al fresco experience.
