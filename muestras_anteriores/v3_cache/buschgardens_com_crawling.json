Read full review Guest-6639181 May 21, 2025 Poor customer service at the Irish Step Dance event Our son paid for us to go to Busch Gardens and especially to attend the Irish Step Dance show. My husband being disabled rented a scooter. 3 different representatives at the gate made us go down the wheelchair ramp. After getting stuck twice we finally made it down only to be told we couldnt be there as the scooter was in the way. We had asked to go in the top doors several times and even waited an hour to get a good seat. Your manager insisted my husband navigate stairs to get back out causing him to fall. No one even apologized or offered us a refund for the special seating. Instead we were treated poorly, intimidated by the manager as well. You need people who are informed as to what to do and who have customer service skills. A lot of money was paid for this trip and we especially came for this show. What a way to ruin the whole day. My husband having severe disability wasnt able to ride the rides, we came for the show. Poor poor way to handle customers either special needs. We were made to feel bad for your poor service and poor knowledge on how people enter the arena. We would have been happy even just to sit at the top row inside the door. We asked for that several times and were refused. Disabled people put out a lot of effort just to come to your park. I plan to let everyone I know not to go to your park as you dont treat people with special needs very kind.

Rides and Attractions | Shows, Entertainment and Presentations | Animal Experiences and Exhibits | Restaurants and Dining | Shopping | Camps and Education | Events | Park Information Named for the lion’s roar, Kumba still reigns as king of the jungle on many lists of the world’s best coasters. -Chris Joy Rides and Attractions Whether you’re yearning for thrills on legendary coasters that will make you scream like a little girl, or prefer family-friendly rides that will leave your littlest adventurers smiling, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is bound to please. Check out this list of rides, complete with ride thrill ratings. Serengeti Flyer The world’s tallest and fastest ride of its kind, the Serengeti Flyer employs twin dueling arms that climb higher and faster with each swing, delivering numerous negative-G thrills as it oscillates. It ultimately reaches blistering speeds of 68 mph and a beg-for-mercy altitude of 135 feet, providing expansive views Busch Gardens Tampa Bay’s 65-acre Serengeti Plain-- if you’re brave enough to open your eyes, that is. Ride Thrill: Extreme Iron Gwazi Just the bare facts about Iron Gwazi are enough to make your palms sweat. This wood and steel hybrid coaster promises 12 airtime moments; three inversions; a 206 foot-tall peak that tumbles into a 91-degree drop; and a max speed of 76 miles per hour, making it North America's tallest and the world's fastest and steepest hybrid coaster. Experts agree: Amusement Today ’s Golden Ticket Awards 2022 proclaimed Iron Gwazi as the best new roller coaster. Ride Thrill: Extreme Tigris Like its namesake, the tiger, Tigris is an agile, powerful beast—and you’re invited to climb aboard. This gasp-worthy expedition covers over 1,800 feet of steel track with looping twists; an inverted heartline roll; forward and backward motion; a 150-foot surge towards the heavens; and drops that will almost certainly leave your stomach behind. Ride Thrill: High Cheetah Hunt A coaster-connoisseur favorite, Cheetah Hunt celebrates the fastest land animal with this steel, triple-launch roller coaster that curves high above the park before plummeting through a rocky gorge. Cheetah Hunt sprints over 4,400 feet, making it the park’s longest thrill ride. Ride Thrill: High Cobra’s Curse Busch Gardens dares you to come face-to-fang with this spinning, family roller coaster, where every ride is different. On this unique, steel coaster, you’ll rise 70 feet only to wind up inches away from a menacing snake with four-foot-fangs. You’ll escape by speeding down a serpentine track, backwards, forwards and then spinning freely. Each train spins at random determined by the riders’ weight distribution. Ride Thrill: Moderate SheiKra SheiKra uses a simple but astoundingly effective method to instill terror into passengers. It climbs 200 feet in the air, creeps over the edge of 90 degree drop, and then… stops. This gives you a good look at the plunge you’re about to take and time to think about life decisions. You’ll dive straight down at a searing 70 mph; tackle an Immelmann loop; experience a second dive into an underground tunnel; and finish the expedition with a splashdown that soaks SheiKra fans waiting to join in the fun. Ride Thrill: Extreme Montu With seven blow-your-mind inversions, Montu is a coaster legend, with rave reviews noting, ‘the forces you feel at the back end of the ride when you hit that batwing are insane.’ Be prepared for climbs; a twisting drop; a 60-foot vertical loop; an Immelmann loop; a weightless roll and a batwing inversion. If you want to ramp up the white-knuckle-factor, sit in the back, where the ‘inversions get really whippy.’ Ride Thrill: Extreme Congo River Rapids Cooling off has never been more fun than on this whitewater rafting trip, a family-friendly expedition with exhilarating dips, a mysterious water cave, and waterfalls that guarantee to get you soaked. Bystanders beside the Congo River Rapids’ banks get in on the action by firing water spray jets at unsuspecting adventurers on the ride. Ride Thrill: Moderate Air Grover Sited in the Sesame Street® Safari of Fun play area, this junior coaster welcomes kids with a mild ride piloted by Grover from Sesame Street. If your little ones are leery of their first roller coaster, you can accompany them on the trip. Ride Thrill: Kid Friendly Serengeti Express Train Journey through Busch Garden's Serengeti Plain on a relaxing train ride to discover a natural wonderland populated with large, free-roaming herds of African animals, including giraffe, zebra, antelope, and ostrich. The train stops in Nairobi and Stanleyville. Ride Thrill: Kid Friendly Kumba Named for the lion’s roar, this infamous, high-speed roller coaster still reigns as king of the jungle on many lists of the world’s best coasters. Reasons include this monster’s seven inversions, an initial 135 foot drop, and one of the planet’s largest diving loops. Be prepared for a full three seconds of utter weightlessness while spiraling 360 degrees. Ride Thrill: Extreme Grand Caravan Carousel Pick a ride atop a glorious steed or enchanting creature on this classic family attraction, complete with bewitching lights and mirrors. Riders under 42” must be accompanied by a responsible person 14 years of age or older and are allowed only on the middle rows. Infants must be accompanied by a responsible person 14 years of age or older and must ride on a bench seat. Ride Thrill: Kid Friendly The Scorpion Don’t worry, this coaster won’t sting… much. One of only three roller coasters of its kind left in the world, Scorpion challenges daredevils with a 360 degree loop and speeds of 50 miles per hour. Ride Thrill: Moderate Ubanga-Banga Bumper Cars Step on the throttle and anticipate a full tank of fun on this timeless family classic, sited in the Congo Play Area. Ride Thrill: Kid Friendly Gwazi Gliders Mild, not wild, aerial thrills are the name of the game on this colorful adventure. Guests must be 56\" or less to ride. Handheld infants aren’t allowed . Ride Thrill: Kid Friendly Stanley Falls Flume Go with the flow and cool down aboard this family-friendly log flume ride. You’ll weave through a lush jungle before the thrilling finale: a nosedive to a 40-foot splashdown. Ride Thrill: Moderate Falcon’s Fury Inspired by skydiving, Falcon’s Fury is a 335-foot, freestanding drop tower. Rising to the peak of the ride takes about a minute, which allows you a lot of time to soak up the soaring views as well as for the fear-factor to build. At the tippy-top of the climb, your seat rotates 90 degrees, so you’re facing straight down. It’s at this moment that you realize your previous terror was just a warmup. Hang on-- you’re about to tumble 300 feet at 60 mph, with your nose leading the way. Ride Thrill: Extreme Sesame Street Safari of Fun Kid-friendly rides, a climbing area and laughter are abundant at Sesame Street Safari of Fun . Your wee ones can make a splash with Zoe-Patra and the Hippos of Nile, a calm water ride with one small hill; sway through the jungle on Rosita's Djembe Fly-Away, a petite carousel swing; and climb in Elmo’s Tree House. Always high on the favorites list, Bert & Ernie's Watering Hole is a water play area brimming with bubblers, geysers, jets, and dumping buckets.

Florida Travel: Meet Amazing Animals on the Serengeti Safari at Busch Gardens Animal Experiences and Exhibits Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is home to more than 200 species of animals, delivering exemplary care to thousands of animals, from too-cute lemurs to speedy, endangered species like cheetahs. This highly accredited zoo invites you to journey into unique, natural habitats, like its 65-acre Serengeti Plain, home to free-roaming herds of giraffe, zebra, antelope and ostrich; and to take tours where you can get an insider’s view of creatures from penguins to gorillas to hippos. Here’s your list of what to see and do. Animal Experiences Share the excitement and passion for Busch Garden’s critters via up-close encounters. Animal Connections Connect with Busch Garden’s famed animal ambassadors at Animal Connections in Nairobi, including two-toed sloths . These adorable, slow-moving herbivores spend the vast majority of their lives upside down in the trees, and eat, sleep, mate and give birth from this unusual vantage point. You can also meet a unique flock of 20 flamboyant flamingos at Animal Connections, hand-raised birds that help spread the word about conservation both inside and outside of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Serengeti Safari Reserve a seat on a roomy, open-air touring vehicle for 30-minute trek across the 65-acre Serengeti Plain, a natural habitat that’s home to zebras, giraffes and ostriches. On this award-winning tour, your guide will share the Serengeti’s secrets and stories. You might even have the chance to let a giraffe nibble treats out of your fingers. Walkabout Way Fun is just a hop away at Walkabout Way, where you can hand-feed Busch Gardens’ mob of kangaroos and meet their cousins, wallabies and wallaroos. Due to the interactive nature of this habitat, guests must be at least five year old to enter. Animal Care Center No trip to Busch Gardens is complete without visiting the state-of-the-art Animal Care Center, featured on the hit, Emmy-nominated TV series The Wildlife Docs . Here, you can watch zoological professionals deliver routine health care; take X-rays; and perform surgeries on a diverse range of critters. It gets better: you might even be able to take part in the procedures. The Center is open daily from 10 a.m. – 5 p.m. Drop by to check the day’s procedure schedule.

Or check out these Busch Garden’s Tours to see which ones speak to your heart. Animal Exhibits Rhinos You don’t need to venture into remote areas of Central and South Africa to see Black rhinos – just visit the Serengeti Plain at Busch Gardens. These rhinos use their hooked lips as special tools for munching on leaves and twigs, and weigh from 1,000 to 3,000 pounds. If you think that’s ginormous, take a gander at the Southern white rhinos, also roaming the plain. Native to eastern and southern Africa, these colossal mammals can measure more than six-feet-tall at the shoulder and weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. Tigers Your kitty may not like baths, but tigers are an altogether different affair. These striped beauties enthusiastically splash into water to cool off or to chase prey, and they’re formidable swimmers that can cross lakes and rivers. At Jungala, you can check out the Bengal tigers-- immense cats by any measure, with males weighing nearly 500 pounds—and maybe even see them take a dip. Elephants Explore Busch Garden’s Nairobi to snag a close-up look at the world’s largest land mammals, Asian elephants. If you want to get even closer to this endangered species, opt for one of the daily connections at the Elephant Interaction Wall. Hyenas You’re invited to take an expedition to the Edge of Africa® to witness the park’s clan of spotted hyenas, which are neither canine nor feline but part of the Hyaenidae family. Often thought of as scavengers, in reality, hyenas are skilled, aggressive predators. As their population in the wild is diminishing, Busch Gardens® Tampa Bay is has welcomed two baby hyenas into the cackle as part of the Species Survival Program. Zebras It’s true: no two zebra's stripes are alike. Check it out for yourself when you embark on the Serengeti Express Train, Serengeti Safari® Tour or at Edge of Africa®, where you can see two species of zebra: Grant's zebras, which have fat stripes that extend around their bellies, and Grevy’s zebras, with narrow stripes and white bellies. Members of the horse family, zebras have complex communication skills and can sleep standing up. Giraffes As nature’s tallest creatures, giraffes are surprisingly nimble. They can sprint up to 35 mph and have been known to jump up to six feet in the air. And they’re fascinating: Giraffes’ necks are too short to reach the ground; they spend most of their lives standing up; and they only need five to 30 minutes of sleep each day. You can come face-to-muzzle with these spotted wonders on the Serengeti Plain, which you can access on the Serengeti Safari ® tour, the Serengeti Express train, or from multiple viewing points on the Edge of Africa ® path. And there’s more! Check out all of Busch Gardens’ amazing animals , including a slithery world of snakes, alligators and crocodiles ; warm-weather-loving African penguins ; and primates like gorillas, chimps and lemurs.
