A sidewalk around the loop enables members to enjoy a comfortable, leisurely stroll, an invigorating walk or jog, or they can bike ride and roller blade in the low traffic streets. Some residents add all the neighborhood streets, which extends their exercise to 7 miles. Dogs can be seen regularly walking with their owners along the loop, each enjoying the exercise and each other’s companionship in Copperleaf’s nature paradise.

This is the final step and crowning achievement of total revitalizing the 23-year-old clubhouse and pool complex after its initial groundbreaking in June 2023. David Dore-Smith, general manager and COO of Copperleaf at The Brooks, welcomed several hundred members, vendors and the construction team to the grand opening event with a champagne celebration recently, introducing guests to all areas of the state-of-the-art clubhouse and its facilities. “Copperleaf has always been admired for its golf course,” shared Dore-Smith. “Additionally, we now have first-class dining and entertainment options for club and associate members that are elevating our club with best-in-class features to serve our members for decades to come.” Loren Wegman of Wegman Design was responsible for the interiors of the entire clubhouse and its custom lighting. Gordon Knapp, owner’s project manager and president of Knapp Construction Management, shared, “Everyone on the team pulled together as they battled the challenges, and the project stayed on track. Sincere congratulations are extended to Chris Curran and his team at Curran Young Construction for weathering many storms and delivering a fantastic, finished product.” Executive Chef Justin Hornyak, who recently completed his first year at Copperleaf, toured club members in his shining three-section kitchen, which will be staffed by two sous chefs and 18 cooks when the club is at full capacity. A Pennsylvania Culinary Arts Institute graduate, Hornyak has been a professional chef for over two decades and loves cooking a wide variety of customer favorites. A seasoned hospitality professional, Carmine Spiro is Copperleaf ’s Food & Beverage director. With a staff of over 30 servers, Spiro is a strong proponent of hospitality training. His immediate goal is to bring exceptional service to club members. “With our expanded dining and entertainment facilities, we have decided to open our venues to non-members wishing an elegant location for weddings and other special events during May-October,” Spiro said. Built by Pulte Homes in 2000, Copperleaf Golf Club is a gated 460-acre master planned development featuring 570 single-family and carriage homes.

Each is connected by beautifully landscaped walkways and roads. The project provides residents a unique blend of convenience and elegance, enhancing the area’s appeal for those seeking a vibrant lifestyle. “Corsa at Estero Crossing is an answer to the growing need for luxury apartment living in the Estero market,” said Claudine Leger-Wetzel, vice president of sales and marketing for Stock Development. “Corsa’s spacious residences and resort-style amenities are a few of the many reasons why residents have rushed to sign a lease at Corsa.” In fact, Corsa is reporting that the community is over 95% leased and is approaching total occupancy as residents prepare to move into their new homes following the grand opening. The gated rental community of Corsa at Estero Crossing features luxury apartments in six three-story buildings with elevators.

Inside the apartment homes, residents enjoy 9-foot, 4-inch ceilings, wood-style floors, spacious walk-in closets, including custom closets in select units; balconies and patios; high-speed fiber internet with fiber-optic technology; ceiling fans, smart home technology and USB charging ports. The kitchens include energy-efficient, stainless-steel appliances with flat-top ranges, side-by-side refrigerators, oversized islands with hardwood modern cabinetry, top-of-the-line plumbing fixtures, walk-in showers, quartz countertops and under-mount sinks.

Amenities include a resort-style pool with a sun shelf, an expansive sun deck, private cabanas, grill stations, a large covered veranda with table games for social gatherings and an indoor-outdoor bar area. Inside the clubhouse, amenities include a sports lounge, golf simulator and media room, individual workspaces, a convenient mini-market and vending center and even two full-size bowling lanes.
