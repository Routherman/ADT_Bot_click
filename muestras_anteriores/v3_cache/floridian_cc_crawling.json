Floridian National Golf Club About Reviews Architect s You’ll really need to hang on to Frigyes Karinthy’s “six degrees of separation” theory in order to get a game at Floridian Yacht & Golf Club (now called Floridian National), for this was Huizenga’s retreat. Many people, well only the lucky few really, reckon that Gary Player’s Floridian should be right up at the top of Florida’s golf course rankings. Only the lucky few got the nod from the billionaire ex-Blockbuster head honcho, Wayne Huizenga, to tee it up here at the Floridan. However, things may change as Huiizenga sold the property to Texan entrepreneur James Crane in April 2010. The Floridian is set on the western bank of the St Lucie River and the property extends to more than 300 acres, which not only includes the Gary Player-designed golf course (redesigned by Tom Fazio in 2011), but also two helicopter landing pads, a number of guest cottages, a deepwater marina and an impressively large four-storey clubhouse. The course, which measures more than 7,000 yards from the tips, opened for play in 1996 and it is very much one of the Black Knight’s proudest North American endeavors. The course, which is routed along part of the waterfront, is very much a Floridian design and there’s nothing other than some ultra-bold bunkering to set this course apart from numerous other Sunshine State layouts. Certainly the two best holes are the closing holes on both loops of nine, which use the waterside setting to good effect. In 2005, Gary Player and his design team went back to the Floridian to remodel the 18th hole. Hurricane damage necessitated the building of a seawall which created an opportunity to move the home hole – from tee to green – nearer to the water. “We now have something that reminds me of the 18th at Pebble Beach, with the dogleg-left and its risk-reward opportunities,” commented Player after he’d played the remodelled 18th. Club membership numbers were not a priority for Wayne Huizenga as the Floridian was his private playground and he and his wife were the only two members in the monthly medal. However, under Jim Crane’s stewardship, Tom Fazio was drafted in to facelift the course in 2011. We suspect getting a game here will become a little easier and we feel sure there will be rather more than two Floridian members in the future.

Follow Author Apr 09, 2024, 06:30am EDT Apr 10, 2024, 04:58pm EDT Share Save Comment The future home of The Outsider Golf Club in Naples, Florida borders The Hideout Golf Club. The Outsider In a story that seems ripped straight out of a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode, when the head of sales at an insurtech firm was denied membership at an exclusive golf club in Naples, Florida, he bought up parcels of land next door and set out to build a better one. Collier County is known for fluffy white sand beaches, slithering Burmese pythons and a veritable bounty of opulent golf courses. There are well over 100 tracks in the area in and around Naples alone and 80% of them are private. Mark Janz, the aforementioned tech exec, is a scratch player and Golf Digest ratings panelist who had relocated down south from Chicago. He’d been a member at Wynstone for years and sought membership at a highly rated golf club in his new home. When he started perusing his options he encountered waitlists ranging from seven to ten years and initiation fees from $350,000 to over $700,000 at non-equity clubs. Forbes Lucas Glover Makes Triumphant Masters Return By Candace Oehler His interest was piqued by a club called The Hideout where NBA legend Larry Bird is a founding member and a couple of his buddies belonged. With his friends vouching for him, he applied to join but would end up getting a thumbs down from the club following his interview. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor “I didn’t get in the golf club for a very strange reason. I asked why the initiation fee went up from $65,000 to $100,000,” Janz, who was simply curious if there were plans for capital improvements, related. He added that he did not ask the question in a remotely condescending manner. But the feedback he got later from his member pal is that the query derailed his bid. Forbes Masters 2024 Golf And Betting Profiles For Top 18 Players By Jay Ginsbach “This was the type of club I didn’t get in—I can’t ask a question like that?” When reached by telephone, the manager of the Hideout expressed that he did not have knowledge of anything that may have occurred and would offer no comment. After getting spurned Janz tried to get in to Olde Florida Golf Club and Naples National, both of which he found very welcoming. Unfortunately, they were full at the time and he was waitlisted—told it could be years till he’d get in. While playing a round with Ryan Chiodo, a local realtor and pal and still stewing over that initial rejection, Janz mentioned that he wished he could just build his own golf course and a seed was planted. The idea struck a chord with Chiodo who is a co-owner on the project. That evening he told him he found 96 acres of sandy soiled land zoned for recreational use. Now, they’d need over double that footprint to build an eighteen-hole course but the good news on that front was that it was connected to two other parcels and altogether that would get them to 227 acres. “Ironically, one of the parcels bordered The Hideout, the golf club directly next door that wouldn’t admit me,” Janz related. They locked up the three tracts, mostly raw land filled with cypress trees and Chiodo asked Janz, ‘ok now what do we do?’ “I told him I’ve been in software and technology my whole career. I have no idea how to build a golf course.” Forbes Prestige Takes Center Stage At The Masters Amidst LIV-PGA Tour Wrangle By Mike Dojc Tapping into his network Janz looped in another friend who happened to have a connection with Dana Fry, the architect who turned what was a pancake flat site into Calusa Pines , one of the most dramatic and celebrated layouts in the Sunshine state. “Thirty seconds later, Dana Fry, who was in Mexico at the time, starts texting me. We start having a conversation back and forth and then he calls me. I told him I want to build a golf course in Naples that’s unlike anything here. Everything is pretty stuffy, meaning shirts tucked in, no music. It’s a different vibe here. I want to build something more LIV Golf than PGA Tour golf meaning I want guys to be able to wear a tee shirt, wear no shirt, I don’t care. And I want to build the best golf course in Southwest Florida, something better than Calusa Pines—the next Top 100 course,” Janz said. Since that initial conversation Fry and his partner Jason Straka have decided not to come aboard the project and so there is not currently an architect attached to the golf course at this stage. Founding Member Model The permitting process however is well underway. Land use attorneys, the army core of engineers, and environmentalists have been dispatched to push the project into gear. “Collier County is very unique in that it takes forever to get things done here and the hurricane made it even worse. It typically takes anywhere from two to three years to get permitted for something like this but we’ve already passed the one-year anniversary,” Janz explained. The expectation is for the golf course, dubbed ‘ The Outsider ’ to open by the end of 2025. Membership will be capped at 250 individuals with initiation fees in the $750,000 ballpark. It will be strictly a golf club with an eighteen-hole course, a clubhouse, some golf cabins on the property, a lit nine-hole par 3 course and a helicopter pad so players on the state’s east coast can easily zip in. To raise capital for the projected $80 million build—though they’re prepared to go as high as $100 million if that’s what it takes to build ‘the best golf course in Southwest Florida’ they’ve adopted a founding membership model. The Outsider is seeking 75 to 100 investors to put up $1 million each, divvied out over rounds during the construction process. In return the founders will receive lifetime club memberships with no annual dues for a set number of years while also re-cooping their principal within five years with their investment converting from equity to a non-interest bearing note. Currently they’re pre-collection but are oversubscribed on pledges for the initial investment round. “We are going to be able to build the golf course, fund all the members back and still make money on this venture,” Janz said, adding that pledged founding members include a couple Augusta National members. Not exactly a fan of the cookie cutter Floridian golf course clones with fairways lined by homes that wend around ponds that seem to pop op on every hole, Janz wants to create something you just don’t see in Naples. The Outsider will be a pure golf course without a housing development component. It will feature rollicking elevation changes while staying true to a prairie links style course aesthetic. As the Outsider borders the Hideout, the club that rejected Janz and got the ball rolling on the whole endeavor, it would be quite the epilogue if down the line the clubs became friendly neighbors and cooked up a reciprocal play arrangement.
