About 94th Aero Squadron The 94th Aero Squadron was one of the first American fighter squadrons to see combat service. It scored more victories than any other American squadron during the First World War. With such famous names as Rickenbacker, Lufbery, James Norman Hall and others, it became the most famous unit of early American airpower. The World War One aviator had to have the greatest of courage. When his frail machine broke up or caught fire, he usually fell thousands of feet to his death. He flew during a time when the full color of chivalry appeared and the skies of France saw mounted warriors bearing heraldic markings ride forth for individual combat. Honor and valor were respected by both sides, and the victor toasted the vanquished. This is the spirit and the atmosphere we have tried to recreate for your dining pleasure.
