Keshawn helped me from beginning to end—he was great! He was very patient with all of my questions and requests. The hall is beautiful and spacious. The staff on the day of the party were super helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend Balmoral for all types of events. Thank you, Keshawn. We had our company Christmas party at Balmoral Event Center. The staff was exceptional – Keyshawn and Shea were there for every question and request. The beef tips in the Burgundy mushroom sauce were delicious. The meat melted in your mouth! The atmosphere was welcoming and classy. I have personally reserved the event center for my dad’s 94th birthday. Top-notch place, food, and service. I just wanted to reach out and thank you and your staff for the wonderful service provided for our party. Many compliments were received. The last few months have been stressful with all the planning, but you were there when we needed you. Though we thanked him personally, please reach out to William again and let him know how happy we were with his culinary expertise. Our guests were very impressed. Once again, thank you. I came here for a 15th birthday party and it was amazingly beautiful. The decoration was beautiful, the place is extremely spacious, and very clean. But, oh my goodness, the food was on another level; it was extremely delicious. Super fresh; the real chef is the best for me. We still talk about how delicious the food was. I recommend it 100%. THANK YOU for everything you did for my mom’s birthday. Everything was fantastic and your team was great to work with. Please share with the Chef that all the guests love the food and some of them eat twice. Again thank you 😊 Rosa Santos Just want to drop a note, and say thank you. Our daughter’s event on Saturday went very well and we were very happy with how everything turned out. You and your staff were amazing, thank you and Juliana and Dali, all of our guests were very impressed and very happy with how everything turned out. We love the venue, it’s a great space, and so happy that we were able to host our special family celebration there! Rebeca Martínez Where do I begin? From the moment I walked in to the exit, nothing but excellence. I can’t remember her name, but the lady in charge was on point, making us feel very comfortable, attentive, and kind—a making-it-happen kind of person. She was AMAZING! The servers provided EXCELLENT service; they were on it before I could think of it, always two steps ahead. They really made our event run smoothly. This is our first venue event, and if I’m honest, I know it won’t be the last. Thank you for all your services in this journey and to all your staff who made it happen. Mia was overwhelmed by how everything was so gorgeous and beautiful. Again, thanks a million! The Martinez Family ❤️ We celebrated our wedding at Balmoral Event center a few days ago at the window room & garden. The Garden is beautiful, the food amazing. Our guest & family enjoyed the party & are still talking about it. The center is pretty & clean. Also, beautiful surroundings like the gazebo. Shout out to the staff, specially chef Noel, our bartender & Laura. Thank you so much, all efforts paid off. Bren R The food was amazing, and you were right that the GF pizza was outstanding. We’ve been GF for almost 10 years, and this is in the top 2 best GF pizzas. Balmoral needs to talk about how great the food is. Our server was equally wonderful, and the event would not have been the same without her. Thank you! J Meredith Thank you so much for letting us practice today. The dancers really enjoyed using their passes or buying tickets to use the Waterpark after their rehearsal. Your staff was wonderful today, from Chrissy’s efficiency in messaging me about filling out waivers ahead of time, to Keyshon unlocking the gate for us, to your restaurant manager cleaning and preparing our rehearsal space. The restaurant’s food and service were great and we enjoyed hearing the laughter of children playing around the Waterpark. Overall, it was a 10 out of 10 day and we hope to make you proud during our next visit on Saturday. Thank you again! Studio C School of Dance and Productions Took the wife to the Pink Floyd tribute band concert and it was great! Went early and had dinner before the concert and it was great! Reasonable prices great service even though the place was packed! The food was excellent! Great time haven’t seen that many 70 year old Hippies since we went to see Leon Russell in concert.
