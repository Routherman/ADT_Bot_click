Yes—tent, flooring, and staging rentals include professional delivery, setup, and teardown in Miami‑Dade and Broward. Table, chair, and linen can be added for an additional fee. How far in advance should I reserve party rentals in Miami? To secure your preferred items and delivery time, we recommend booking as soon as your event date and inventory list are confirmed, especially during peak seasons. Although we can fulfill last minute requests, it is recommended 4 – 6 weeks in advance. What’s your cancellation and rain policy? You may reschedule due to rain at no penalty — just notify us before the event. Last-minute cancellations may result in forfeiture of deposit or a partial credit. What surfaces can a dance floor rental be set up on? Our dance floors can be installed over nearly any surface—including grass, sand, gravel, concrete, turf, or tile. Whether you’re hosting your event on uneven terrain or indoors, we first lay down a solid event flooring base to ensure a smooth, stable dance surface. For added comfort and style, you can also explore floor coverings like turf, carpet, or wood-look vinyl. How do I get a quote for a pool cover rental? Simply submit your pool’s dimensions and photos to happy@gmevents.info . After we review, we’ll schedule an onsite inspection to confirm compatibility before confirming installation. Do you deliver outside of Miami, and is there a minimum rental requirement? Yes—we service Miami‑Dade, Broward, and Homestead areas. Delivery fees and minimum rental orders may apply depending on distance. What are your tent and equipment setup requirements? Tents require a level, cleared area with approximately 4 feet of clearance on all sides. Lighting or AC units should have power access within ~50 ft. We’ll verify specifics during delivery prep. What happens if rentals are damaged or missing? All rental items are inspected and tracked. You’ll be responsible only for replacement or repair costs due to excessive wear or lost items – standard wear is covered. Can I make changes to my order after booking? Yes—as long as product availability allows. Any revisions within 14 days of your event may incur fees or be treated as partial cancellation. What forms of payment do you accept and is a deposit required? We accept major credit cards, Zelle, or ACH transfers. A non-refundable deposit (usually ~50%) is required to confirm your reservation, with full payment due 7 business days before your event.
