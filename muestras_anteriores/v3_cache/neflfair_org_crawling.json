Since 1964, we have served the citizens of Duval, St. Johns, Nassau, Baker, Clay, and Putnam counties through a range of charitable and civic activities, while helping individual donors achieve their philanthropic goals. We believe in Giving Back. Forever Forward. DOWNLOAD OUR FAST FACTS 2024 Report to the Community: If the report had a soundtrack, it might include Stevie Wonder’s 1976 song “Love’s in Need of Love Today.” The message is simple yet powerful: for love to grow, it must be nurtured. What better analogy for philanthropy in our community? Every grant we make is a reflection of a donor’s love of community, amplified through time and space. Read the report here. Created by generous individuals, families, businesses and organizations, each of our more than 740 funds helps build stronger communities. We have helped countless generous individuals and families understand their financial options and maximize their charitable giving; in turn, thousands of area organizations have benefited from the more than $850 million in grants we have made since inception. Through this rich history and in partnership with our donors, we have acquired deep knowledge of critical local issues, and we embrace our ability to help lead positive change in our community. It is this legacy of civic and philanthropic leadership upon which we strive to build every day so that we can continue to do good work, forever. The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt public charity {EIN: 59-6150746} governed by a community-based Board of Trustees and led by President Isaiah M. Oliver . Our Mission Stimulating Philanthropy To Build A Better Community We do this through Civic Leadership Philanthropic Leadership Providing products & services to help our donors fulfill their philanthropic goals Our Values: Grantmaking that is fair and thoughtful Leadership that trusts and respects the intent of donors Service to the community that is innovative and creative Governance with integrity that puts community above self Equity centered as a core strategy of the Foundation 60 Years of Giving Back, Giving Forward Three momentous events occurred in Jacksonville in 1964 – Hurricane Dora swept through our city, the Beatles performed live at The Gator Bowl, and The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida was born. Both Hurricane Dora and The Beatles retreated within hours, but The Community Foundation remains to this day—sustained by generous donors who create permanent charitable funds that improve the quality of life in our community. It was the bold vision of J.J. Daniel, Robert R. Feagin, Laurence Lee, Jr., and Thomas R. McGehee that pioneered the original entity, known as The Greater Jacksonville Area Community Foundation. The first significant gift was $45,000—proceeds from the sale of the Community Chest-United Fund building on Market Street. Today, our assets have grown to more $700 million dollars in 2024, but our commitment remains the same – to work with donors who want to give thoughtfully to improve the quality of life in our community. Take a moment to view some of The Community Foundation’s important milestones that have been achieved along the way. View Timeline “…a depository for the people of Jacksonville, both the large and small, the wealthy and the moderate, to be able to give for the betterment of their fellow man, not just today, but in a continuing way.” – Founding partner Thomas R. McGehee, May 1964 What Is a Community Foundation? Community foundations are tax-exempt public charities serving thousands of people who share a common interest—improving the quality of life in their area. All community foundations are overseen by a volunteer board of trustees, comprised of leading citizens and run by professionals with expertise in identifying their communities’ needs. Today, nearly 800 U.S. community foundations collectively grant more than $6.5 billion each year and manage more than $82 billion in charitable assets. “Our greatest satisfaction is to work with visionary philanthropists to help them achieve their charitable goals.” – Isaiah M.

GENERAL RULES & REGULATIONS FOR LIVESTOCK EXHIBITORS PURPOSE The purpose of the North Florida Fair Youth/4-H/FFA Livestock and Animal Shows is to develop leadership, citizenship, a sense of understanding, self-assurance, sportsmanship, and an attitude of dependability in youth. Its aim is to provide meaningful experiences that will help youth develop into responsible, mature adults. The North Florida Fair Judging Events serve to teach the fundamentals of good animal husbandry, to emphasize quality in livestock and animals, and to demonstrate the finer points of showmanship and exhibition. In addition, they provide a suitable environment where youth can become better acquainted with other youth and adults and compete for recognition in an ever-growing complex society. NOTICE All exhibitors are cautioned to read carefully the following rules and regulations, as they will be enforced strictly, with no deviation. The North Florida Fair will be held on the Fairgrounds, November 6 – November 16, 2025. ADMINISTRATION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS The North Florida Fair Association reserves the final and absolute right to interpret these rules and regulations and to arbitrarily settle and determine all matters, questions and differences in regards thereto, or otherwise arising out of or connected with or incident to the Show, and the right to amend or add to these rules as its judgment may determine. An exhibitor who violates any of the following rules will forfeit all privileges and premiums and be subject to such penalty as the North Florida Fair may order. STATEMENT OF LIABILITY 1. All livestock exhibits will be under the direction of the North Florida Fair Association, but the Association will in no case be responsible for any loss or damage that may occur. Each exhibitor will be solely responsible for any consequential or other loss, injury or damage done to, or occasioned by, or arising from, any animal or article exhibited by him/her and for its description as given in the on-line catalog, and shall indemnify the North Florida Fair Association against all legal or other proceedings in regard thereto, as well as damage or injury to any other person or property, caused by the exhibitor or any of the animals exhibited by him, or arising out of, or in any way connected with such exhibition of any of the animals so exhibited. 2. The management reserves the right to remove from the grounds any exhibit, animal, or fowl that may be falsely entered or may be deemed unsuitable or objectionable, without assigning a reason therefore, and if necessary, to return any money already paid for the space or stalls, which shall exonerate them from any claim whatsoever on the part of the exhibitor or purchaser.

Certificate of registration: All animals in the breeding classes must be recorded in recognized books of record for their respective breeds. Exhibitors must produce certificates of registry at the request of the superintendent in charge. 5. Ownership: Exhibitors entering an animal in any other than the name of the bona fide owner or owners, or showing an animal in a class for which it is not eligible, may, at the discretion of the management, be barred from further showing, and any or all premiums previously awarded may be forfeited. Entries that have been erroneously entered will be transferred to their proper classes prior to judging. Animals owned in partnership may be entered in proper classes in one owner’s name, but must appear under this ownership in all classes entered. 6.
