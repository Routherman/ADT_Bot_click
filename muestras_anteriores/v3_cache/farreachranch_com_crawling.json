Job listing PDF Subscribe to our newsletter! The form will open in a new window. FAQs View all FAQs Do you ship to Canada/Europe/Internationally? No, we only ship within the United States. A plant I want is out of stock, can you let me know when it's back in stock? Can I preorder? If you click on a plant that is out of stock, you will find a green link below the Add to Cart button that says: \"EMAIL ME when back in stock.\" You can click this and enter an email, and will be sent an email as soon as the plant is back in stock. We do not take pre-orders. Are you open? Can I come visit? We unfortunately do not have the staff available to be open for retail shopping anymore. For those of you who miss walking around the gardens, members of the Far Reaches Botanical Conservancy are welcome to visit by appointment, and those picking up orders in person are welcome as well please just let us know in advance! I ordered with 3-Day Shipping. It's been 3 days since my order, why haven't I received my plants? 3-Day Shipping does NOT mean your order will be shipped within 3 days of purchase! It means once we ship the plants, they should arrive within 3 days of the SHIP DATE. You choose your own shipping date on the checkout page when you order, and we require a certain amount of time to get your plants ready after ordering. Far Reaches Botanical Conservancy The mission of the Conservancy is to facilitate the acquisition and introduction to North America of threatened and vulnerable ornamental plants of known wild provenance as well as from cultivated sources. These plants will be maintained as a living reference collection for public educational and scientific purposes with the goal of conservation through cultivation via distribution to botanic and public gardens, botanists and researchers plus professional and amateur gardeners and horticulturists. Visit Gift Card The Far Reaches Gift Card is the perfect present for the plant lover in your life. It provides access to rare plants that can't be found anywhere else.
