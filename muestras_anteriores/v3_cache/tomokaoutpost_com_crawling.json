Tomoka Outpost | Facebook __________________________________ Check this out... The camp store has been a place for everyone to gather, grab a snack, soda, water, beer or wine, Cup-ah Cajun and relax in the air-conditioned building overlooking the beautiful Tomoka River, pick up firewood, frozen bait, camping/outdoors necessities and even purchase a neat souvenir to take home. If you haven't been by in a while, we've definitely added some new stuff! Rocking chairs overlooking the Tomoka River, Tall chairs on the back patio, the \"Crow's Nest\" and we've begun \"setting sail\" on the riverside patio with our awesome shade covered countertop area. We've turned an old sailboat into a neat riverside hangout table, added more posts and a museum like countertop with some unique history.  Tomoka Outpost has a complete and real dungeon along with many other new additions you may or may not notice...but we're constantly improving for you! Most recently, we've completed our 3 \"building long\" countertops overlooking the Tomoka River made with salvaged dock wood Capt. Scott got from the islands in the river after hurricanes Mathew and Irma.  You'll be able to shop, sip and enjoy the absolutely beautiful views from our air-conditioned building. ​There's a looong list of new additions to come but like we always say, \"little by little.\" Please give us a call (386-673-0022) or shoot us an email ( tomokaoutpost@aol.com ) to share your ideas and what you'd like to see at the Tomoka Outpost!
