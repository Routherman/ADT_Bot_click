The company was established in 1988 by brother/sister team Garry and Candace James who had worked together in the special events industry since their high school days. The staff of talented and creative party professionals includes 35 full-time employees and over 500 seasonal part-time employees making James Event Productions one of the largest event management companies in California. Our experienced team of sales, management and production professionals brings the combined experience of more than 250 years of event planning to your special event. GARRY JAMES Founder and Co-Owner 714.563.9778 ext 106 garry@jamesevents.com With more than 20 years of experience in the event industry, Garry and his sister, Candace, co-founded James Event Productions in 1988.  Fast forward 35 years later, his expertise, leadership, and passion for events have catapulted the company as a Southern California Event Production industry leader. His vision and commitment took a fledgling picnic company and expanded it into a multi-faceted event and entertainment organization. His professionalism, resiliency, and positive attitude have led an experienced sales and events team to produce over 20,000 events for corporations, nonprofits, schools, and organizations. Garry believes in family first, inspiring his employees to live, laugh, love, and have the time of their lives! CANDACE JAMES BRACKETT Founder Candace James Brackett founded James Event Productions with her brother, Garry, in the late ‘80s.  In 2020, Candy lost her battle with cancer, leaving our James Events family with a large void that can never be replaced. The company continues to sense her vibrant spirit and deep compassion for others, particularly for animals.  Candy served as vice president for 30 years and developed some of our most important client relationships, many of which are still in effect today. Above all, she truly was a comforting and stabilizing voice amidst the chaos of event planning.  If you arrived at her office just around closing time, you would often find yourself in a long conversation where you would laugh and trade stories about her USC heritage, children, favorite pets, and much more.  We really miss Candy and will always cherish the memories we have of her. CHRISTOPHER BRACKETT President 714.563.9778 ext 105 chris@jamesevents.com As the son of Candy and Elmer Brackett (co-founder and co-owner of James Event Productions), Chris has immersed himself in event production since his earliest years. Officially an employee at 15, he was promoted to Operations Manager in 2011, overseeing our Amusement Rides Division. There, he changed the face of the amusement ride industry in California. Chris' innovations led to our reputation of having the most professional, well-trained, and friendly staff with dozens of impeccably cleaned, maintained, and state-certified rides and attractions. His transition into the role of President balanced decades of tradition and a relationship-based client approach with the latest innovations in event management. From the bidding process to project realization, he is implementing new technology to create the best events in the industry with maximum ease for the client. He has a player-coach approach that helps the team here execute the best Company Picnics, Galas, Nonprofit Events, Corporate Parties, and Festivals. ELMER BRACKETT Co-Owner Elmer Brackett co-owns James Event Productions, which he established with his late wife, Candy James Brackett, and her brother, Garry James.  Before launching James Productions, Elmer served as the Chief Executive Officer of a leading security and alarm systems provider. Earlier in his career, he worked as a mechanical engineer in the aerospace industry. Currently, Elmer leverages his specialized knowledge and expertise to support the operations team at James Productions, providing advice on amusement ride maintenance and safety. He enjoys spending quality time in the company machine shop, with his children, and with his grandson, Jace.

CHRISTINE MARTINEZ Senior Event & Marketing Director 714.563.9778 ext 107 christine@jamesevents.com Christine, a proud New Yorker, began her career in professional baseball, executing events and player appearances for several Major League teams after receiving her Bachelor's in Management of Sports Industries and Communication. Her career took a new turn when she relocated to California, where she continued her 20-year passion for producing events while working in City Government, Higher Education, and the Nonprofit sector. Utilizing her eye for design and creativity, Christine has produced exclusive events for celebrities and Fortune 500 companies to create a dynamic and unique experience. Currently, she leads James Events' marketing and communications team and the company's social media.  Christine believes in staying ahead of current trends to provide the best experience for her clients.

JASON THIBERT Senior Event Director 714.563.9778 ext 109 jason@jamesevents.com Jason has worked in the event industry since he started with James Event Productions in 1995. He quickly progressed from picnic staff to rides operator, event technician, and event manager running our most significant events and locations.

Eventually, he found his best match with our Sales Team and began working with various corporate clients, large-scale festivals, and nonprofit events.

He focuses not only on his events but also on companywide logistics and operations. DANIEL BARRETT Operations Manager/AR & AP Manager 714.563.9778 ext 122 daniel@jamesevents.com When he started at James Event Productions, no one knew what to expect from this polite high school kid from Orange County.

During this time, he developed his skills in the event industry and earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from UC Riverside with an emphasis in accounting.  Daniel oversees the entire distribution plan for James Events, managing the warehouse operations by projecting, dispatching, and inventory all products, as well as overseeing park operations and labor at Oak Canyon, Lakeview, Newport Dunes, and Kiwanisland.  Wearing several hats, Daniel also utilizes his accounting background to manage the accounts payable and receivables for James Event Productions. ROB HILBURN Senior Event and Entertainment Director 714.563.9778 ext 121 Rob@jamesevents.com As Rob prepares to celebrate his 35th year at James Productions, his event count has exceeded 4,000, with more than 2,000 events on the microphone as the voice of James Event Productions. As our Entertainment Director, he actively seeks new talent and creates engaging and contemporary entertainment offerings. And his skills as a master of ceremonies and entertainers make him an often-requested commodity for many of our biggest clients. Rob's many years of event management have given him integral roles in planning events for the likes of Walt Disney, New Balance, DreamWorks, the March of Dimes, and hundreds more.
