From a few rough cages located around the perimeter of Pioneer Park to a model Refuge, dreams became reality when we relocated to our new facility in 2001. Today the Refuge is home to native Florida wildlife and a few exotic species, each housed in natural-type habitats. Coming from various walks of life, each animal has been placed in our care with their own unique story . However, they do have one thing in common – they needed a forever home and could not survive in the wild. Now they are thriving in their refuge home, which provides nutritional food, shelter, and large physical areas for enrichment activity. Guests are encouraged to visit the Refuge and take a stroll among the tree tops on the elevated boardwalk and become educated about the animals that make the Hardee County Wildlife Refuge their home.

Each item is maintained either within glass-enclosed cases or strategically placed around the museum floor. Many of the larger items are provided in a setting that would be reminiscent of pioneer living. The items are identified with a tag that not only gives its description but includes the name of the person who donated it. Proper records are maintained, so at any time, a guest may inquire about a certain item donated by a family member and its location can be retrieved through its computer database. This procedure is used many times within a month to assist family members in viewing a loved one’s acquisition.
