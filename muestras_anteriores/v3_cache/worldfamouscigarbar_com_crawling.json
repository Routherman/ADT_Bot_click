Cigars weren’t just a pastime; they became a way to slow down, connect, and find common ground. What started as a small weekly ritual has grown into a premium cigar brand with a mission: to deliver timeless cigars that inspire connection, conversation, and camaraderie. We believe a great cigar is more than what’s in the wrapper—it’s the moments it creates, the people it brings together, and the stories it sparks. We’re a community cigar brand, and we’d love to hear from you. Have an idea, want to say hi, send us an email. Reach Out to Us Veteran Owned and Operated Founders is a veteran owned company, and one of our co-founders, Brian, proudly serves on active duty. Military values—discipline, service, community—are the foundation of who we are and what we stand for. We are committed to honoring those who have come before us while building a brand that reflects the resilience and freedom that defines the American spirit. We’re proud to be recognized among the best veteran owned companies and deeply believe in supporting others who serve and lead. We’re thankful for people like Brian who have sacrificed their lives for all of us. If you’re a vet or active military, reach out to us, we’d love to hear from you. We love partnering with veteran owned companies and events. Let's Collaborate Premium Cigars from the Dominican Republic Our cigars are handcrafted in the Dominican Republic, known worldwide for producing some of the finest, most flavorful tobaccos. Each blend we offer—from bold and complex to smooth and approachable—is thoughtfully developed to deliver a quality smoking experience that rivals the best cigar brands. Whether you’re filling your cigar humidor, selecting a cigar for a celebration, or simply unwinding at the end of the day, Founders offers consistent excellence you can count on. You can buy cigars online directly from our shop—or better yet, ask your local cigar shop to carry Founders. Shop Premium Cigars Cigar Education, Etiquette, and Culture We’re passionate about helping smokers of all levels feel confident and welcome in the cigar world. Through our blog, social media, and YouTube channel, we provide engaging and informative cigar education—everything from cigar etiquette to how to choose the right cigar cutter, store cigars properly with a cigar humidifier, or travel with your favorite smokes using a cigar case or cigar holder. Whether you’re new to cigars or a longtime aficionado, we’re here to help you enjoy the experience to the fullest. Visit our YouTube Channel . Learn More About Cigars Community At its core, Founders is about community. Cigars have a special way of bringing people together—whether it’s around a fire, in a lounge, or at a backyard gathering. We believe in creating space for connection, conversation, and camaraderie. That’s why we’re not just building an audience—we’re building a movement. But we don’t want to exist only online. We want to be in your community. We want to be the cigar you reach for at your local shop, the brand you recommend to a friend, and the name you know when you want a reliable, premium smoke. If you love Founders, ask your local cigar shop to carry us. Your voice helps us grow—and helps us show up in the places that matter most. Together, we’re building more than a brand. We’re building a brotherhood (and sisterhood) of cigar lovers who value quality, story, and connection.
