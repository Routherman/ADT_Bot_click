How do I know if an offer for my property is legitimate? + We want you to be aware of a growing number of timeshare exit companies that are inundating owners with direct mailings, telemarketing, and seminar invitations. They claim they can release them from their timeshare obligations, resell or rent their property for an up-front fee. Here are a few helpful tips and red flags for identifying and combatting timeshare exit, rental and resale scams: • Upfront Fees – beware of requests for upfront fees such as administrative fees, advertising fees, closing fees, and service or tax requirement fees. • Protect your information – another technique is to solicit owners on social media and ask for them to message or email their contact and ownership information. • Unsolicited Contact – beware of unsolicited calls, emails or correspondence from someone offering to sell, dispose of or rent your timeshare for any up-front fee. • Interested Buyer – beware of calls or emails claiming to have an interested buyer or renter for your timeshare. • Offers to transfer paid-off ownership – be wary of any calls or mailings that offer to transfer paid-off ownership to another party. • Too good to be true – beware of any offer that sounds too good to be true, these offers are usually a scam. • Read the warnings – don’t be tricked by a fancy address or professional-looking website. • Don’t be a victim – when in doubt, we encourage you to contact your resort, Association or management company or the Concierge Department at 1-888-629-9593 to confirm the authenticity of any proposal or offer being made to you.

This was the 9th place we called and Judy answered the phone. She said YES there is space for us.  She gave us great information over the phone with the gate code and directions to our spot. We arrived after dark. She connected with us via phone when we arrived and guided us to our spot. This place was quiet. Just what we were looking for after a long drive. Once we were settled, we walked around the camp. There is a nice outdoor pool, hot tub and game room with plenty of games and DVD’s to check out. It has foosball and a ping pong table. There are a few community fire pits, grill and a outdoor pizza oven. Overall, a great night camping here.
