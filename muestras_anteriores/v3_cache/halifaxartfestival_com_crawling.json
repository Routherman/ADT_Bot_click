YAY!! I couldn’t be happier to have you join me and follow the 2021 launch of this exciting career pivot. Thank you for the support & your enthusiasm for my work! ♡Sarah For thousands of years, First Nations people have walked on this land. Their relationship with the land is at the centre of their lives.  Wherever you are, please take a moment to reflect on the traditional caretakers of the lands you call home.  Here in Bruce County, Ontario, I want to acknowledge the traditional Territory of the Anishinabek Nation: The People of the Three Fires known as Ojibway, Odawa, and Pottawatomie Nations. And further give thanks to the Chippewas of Saugeen, and the Chippewas of Nawash, now known as the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, as the traditional keepers of this land. I want to acknowledge further the more recent history and ongoing connections the Saugeen Metis have to this place. May we all, as Treaty People, live with respect on this land and live in peace and friendship with all its diverse peoples.

Nova Road, Daytona Beach, FL 32114; Phone: 386-304-7247; Email: andreapair@cfl.rr.com ; Website: www.halifaxartfestival.org ; Application fee: $40; Space fees: $225 to $350; Space sizes: 10x10 to 20x10; 100% outdoors; Exhibitors: 220; Attendance estimate: 30,000. Compiled from FastAudit reviews The Halifax Art Festival takes place in the downtown area of Daytona Beach, Florida. Of the artists who reviewed 2023’s event, 72% said they would exhibit in it again. An artist whose medium was drawing reported $1,900 in sales and would do the show again. “I have done it several times in the past and (weather permitting) I always do well,” the artist said. This artist was not a fan of the large gaps between booths due to the new street layout but said it was the only way it could be done. “I was close to the end of the festival area (near Bay Street), and I think some people stopped and turned around at the area between the booths before getting to the small section of booths on that end,” the artist said. A ceramicist would return as well. This artist made $1,200. An artist whose mediums are fine craft and jewelry will not do this show again. “About 70 non-juried ‘artists’ were all buy/sell and located in their own section of the show. However, the customer does not know they are buy/sell,” said the artist who made $2,000. “Buy/sell is not compatible with a fine art show.” Also not interested in returning is an artist whose mediums are fine art and mixed media. The artist made $150 and said sales were down the last two years — making it not worthwhile. This artist also commented on the judging process, saying judges were knowledgeable in past years but not in 2023. “They barely spent any time in booth, and it was not just me that this happened to,” said this artist. But an artist whose mediums are fine art, mixed media, and art glass felt the opposite about the festival. This artist made $5,100 and said, “It was a nice event with quality vendors. I really appreciated the organization and the hospitality by the host team.” One fine art artist is unsure about future participation, saying a lot can happen before 2024’s show. The artist did not say how much was made at 2023’s event. An artist whose mediums are fine art and fiber/textile/leather made about $600 and will not exhibit there again. “The attendance was nowhere near close to what the show had advertised on their application. I understand that this is something they cannot control, but a better estimate would be appreciated. The consensus of the artists I spoke with said there were a lot of lookers. The people who did make purchases were seemingly only purchasing items $50 and under. I did not see a lot of people carrying around originals or large works,” the artist said. “I will say that the show management did an excellent job of communicating the necessary information. They sent out emails as things changed or when the artists needed to be notified. They even sent out a daylight savings time reminder before Sunday's event. Loading-in and -out was fairly easy and not too congested. Parking was between a two- to 10-minute walk, depending on where you were placed on the map. All-in-all, I wouldn't return because of the lack of attendance and the lack of sales. I actually lost money on this event. Bummer. I wanted this one to be great.” It was a nice, local event for an arts and crafts artist who lives in Daytona Beach, which is why this artist would participate again. The artist’s sales totaled $1,800. Better night-time security is needed, the artist noted, saying “One side of my tent was unzipped, and it looked like someone slept on a table inside the tent.” An artist whose mediums are wood, along with arts and crafts, made $5,500 and wants to return, saying it was a well-organized festival, with good advertising. The festival was close to home for an artist whose medium was drawing. The artist reported $2,500 in sales and wants to return. Sales were disappointing for a fine art artist who made $210. This artist will not be back, noting there was a competing type of art two doors down. An art glass artist might participate again. The artist had $2,000 in sales and said there were lots of lookers and older people who were not buyers. A fine art artist who made $2,000 thought the event was planned and run well. This artist would return. But a metal artist whose sales totaled $1,000 does not want to go back. A fine art artist who had $4,100 in sales wants to participate again, saying, “It was my most successful show with sales and feedback. It's local to my residence, so its super easy to get to and from.” Advertisement Choose Your Download 105 Tips and Tricks for your Art Fair Booth eBook: Ultimate Guide to Handcrafted Success Click here to download!

We invite all forms of art from beginner to professional level, with programs and events happening all year round. Through our diverse roster of exhibitions and events, we hope to entertain, educate, and motivate the next generation of Nova Scotia's artistic talent. The Sanctuary Arts Centre is a place where artistry comes to life and community comes together. Contact Us A Little About The Sanctuary There's no mistaking the 100+ years of history behind this building. For years, the First Baptist church stood at the corner of Ochterloney and Wentworth Street in Dartmouth. After it was sadly destroyed in the Halifax Explosion, the parishioners hired renowned architect Andrew Cobb to design and build a new house of worship out of steel and stone to ensure it would never fall again. You can still find a foundation stone on the front of the church marking its finished construction in 1921. From its bold stone face to its peaked roof (which, fun fact, is actually shaped like a crucifix from above), the Arts Centre is an unmissable landmark, centrally located in Downtown Dartmouth. As you enter the Sanctuary Theatre, your eye will undoubtedly be drawn to the deep stage, and acoustic arches (once used to amplify a grand pipe organ), the wide capacity wooden church pews with gently slopping theatre floors (every seat is a great one!) and, of course, the artist crafted stained glass windows; a gift from various Dartmouth families and parishioners over the years.

VISION The HAT will be a leader of artistic excellence for the performing arts in Atlantic Canada, enriching the lives of artists, audiences, and the broader community through accessible professional theatre. MISSION To fortify the professional theatre community in Cape Breton, to drive the local creative economy, to produce first-class, home-grown productions, and champion the education of the next generation of theatre artists. MANDATE To provide a year-round, professional theatrical presence in downtown Sydney, producing and presenting quality productions with a special emphasis on Cape Breton artists, stories, and songs. About Us Highland Arts Theatre, or \"The HAT\" as it's affectionately called, is the name of a performance venue in downtown Sydney, Nova Scotia, formerly the home of St. Andrew's Church. When the church was decommissioned in 2013, a team led by local businessman Kevin Colford stepped up to transform the beloved historical building into a state-of-the-art centre for arts and culture. The venue officially re-opened in June 2014 with an original musical comedy: \"The Wakowski Brothers\". While the venue is available for rent and has hosted many of Cape Breton's finest in the fields of music, comedy, dance and literature (such as Brent Butt, Ron James, The CBC Massey Lecture, Port Cities) , it is our mandate to create a year-round, professional theatrical presence in downtown Sydney, producing and presenting quality productions with a special emphasis on Cape Breton artists, stories, and songs. The Highland Arts Theatre Association is a non-profit organization registered under the Societies Act of Nova Scotia (3285136) and a registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency (82383 3181 RR0001.) We are a Professional Member of Theatre Nova Scotia and have memberships with the Sydney & Area Chamber of Commerce, the Playwrights Atlantic Resource Centre (PARC), and the Playwrights Guild of Canada. In 2020, we piloted our brand new operating model: Radical Access - a crowd-sourcing model that allows us to offer all Mainstage Productions free of charge (inquire today for bookings or donations at info@highlandartstheatre.com). Our productions have toured to Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and mainland Nova Scotia and we have conducted partnerships and co-productions with Neptune Theatre, the Savoy Theatre, Sacred Heart Downtown, Eastern Front Theatre, Theatre New Brunswick, Festival Antigonish, The Confederation Centre for the Arts, the 2023 Canada Games, and the Chester Playhouse. About the Building Built by the Sydney and Mira Presbyterian congregation, originating in 1852, construction for St. Andrew's United Church started in 1910 and was completed in 1911. It was the third church built by the congregation, and was built to contain 1,000 people for services. Designed by architects Curry and Sparling, and built by Rhodes and Curry Company, the building was constructed using red brick from Mira, and the cost was $62,945. The church was fit with a 3,000 pipe pipe-organ made by the famous Casavant Frères in Quebec, as well as 10 engraved bell chimes that are still in use today. Architecturally, the end result was a beautiful house of worship, with impressive towers, bells chiming on Sundays and the steadfast permanence of the Gothic Revival style, rare within the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. In 2014, local business man Kevin Colford renovated the former church into its current form, a state of the art theatre venue in Downtown Sydney. HAT Academy After several years of courses being offered through the Highland Arts Theatre, the HAT Academy was officially launched in 2019 to meet the growing demand for more education opportunities. Courses and training programs are offered for recreational, emerging, and professional artists aged 5 to 105, covering topics including acting, music, dance, triple threat performance, writing, directing, stage craft, improv, Shakespeare, and more! Our first Academy production, Seussical the Musical, hit the stage in March 2019. The Academy's current home is 295 Charlotte Street, just behind the main theatre building. Many students (youth and adult) have made the leap from the Academy to the Mainstage, being hired as performers and stage craft artists in our season of professional productions. Some have had their writing developed for full length productions, and members of our current faculty began as students of the Academy. Whether you're looking for artistic growth or something to do, we pride the HAT Academy as a jumping off point for those looking to get more involved in our community. Thanks to our Radical Access program 100 scholarships are awarded annually to students in need of financial support. For more information, you can email us at academy@highlandartstheatre.com !

If you don't find Ken in a theatre, try looking on a sailboat somewhere out on the Bras d'Or Lakes.  He'll probably be there... Nik Boisvert PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (they/them) Nik has descended from a long line of theatre kids, D&D nerds, and fix-it goblins.

This territory is covered by the “Treaties of Peace and Friendship” which Mi’kmaq and Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) people first signed with the British Crown in 1725. The treaties did not deal with the surrender of lands and resources but in fact, recognized Mi’kmaq and Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) title and established the rules for what was to be an ongoing relationship between nations. We, as treaty people, are responsible to uphold the fundamental rights of the Mi’kmaq as promised in the Peace and Friendship Treaties. We aim to listen to Indigenous voices and actively participate in the process of reconciliation. Wonder’neath Public Programming Calendar This calendar lists only Wonder’neath programs.
