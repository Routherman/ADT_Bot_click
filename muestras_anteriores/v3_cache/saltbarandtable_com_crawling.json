      "text": "A bar in Salt Lake City is a 2025 finalist for the James Beard Awards James Beard Awards: One of the country’s 5 best bars is in Salt Lake City The winners will be announced at an event in Chicago on June 16. (Eliesa Johnson and Melissa Hesse  |  The Restaurant Project) The James Beard Award, considered the most prestigious honor for American restaurants and chefs. A Salt Lake City bar has been named as a nominee — essentially, a finalist — for the prestigious James Beards Awards, which celebrate the best in the food and beverage world. The James Beard Foundation announced Wednesday that Water Witch , at 163 W. 900 South in the Central Ninth neighborhood, made it to the nominee list. It is up against fellow nominees Kumiko in Chicago; Scotch Lodge in Portland, Oregon; The Lovers Bar at Friday Saturday Sunday in Philadelphia; and Wolf Tree in White River Junction, Vermont. In 2022, Water Witch was a semifinalist for Outstanding Bar Program, and in 2024, chef David Chon at Bar Nohm, Water Witch’s sister bar, was nominated for Best Chef in the Mountain region . (Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) The cozy Water Witch nuzzles up next to Bar Nohm offering patrons a pass through doorway or patio bypass in Salt Lake City, on Thursday, July 13, 2023. Creating a ‘neighborhood cocktail bar’ Sean Neves, who co-founded Water Witch with Scott Gardner and Matt Pfohl in 2016, said being included on the James Beard nominee list was “just crazy.” “Some of the other bars that are on that list are just amazing operations that we really look up to, so we’re definitely honored,” Neves said. The bar’s day-to-day operations are run by an “amazing assemblage of super talented young people,” Neves said, including general manager Kenzi Anderson, assistant general manager/lead bartender JJ Barth, and Adam “Scoop” Kaessner, who is our “mad scientist, creative crazy person that puts together all of our ideas.” When Neves, Gardner and Pfohl were looking for a space to turn into a bar, they heard about a tiny vacant spot in Central Ninth and decided to jump on it, “because we really thought that that neighborhood was going to go off,” Neves said. Central Ninth was still developing at that time, far from the vibrant food and drink hub it is now. The trio’s “only rubric for Water Witch was that our first bar should be a place you want to hang out in,” Neves said. They started “really playing around with what cocktails could do, but we didn’t want it to be really super formal.” Instead, “... we wanted to do a neighborhood cocktail bar. That’s what we tried to pull off, and I think that’s what we succeeded in doing.” When Water Witch first opened, they didn’t have a cocktail menu. Instead, they did “wild card” cocktails, where people would come in and tell the bartender what they were in the mood for, and then the bartender would come up with a delicious drink. Eventually, they had to develop a set menu for efficiency’s sake, Neves said, but Water Witch’s menu still changes with the seasons. In the winter, the bartenders will use more vinegars and preserved ingredients; in the spring and summer, they will take advantage of locally grown produce, he said. But no matter the season, “we try to push the envelope a little bit and get creative,” Neves said. One area that creativity shows up in is the bar’s commitment to reducing waste. Neves said they zest all their citrus fruits before they juice them, and use that zest to make fragrant syrups. Pineapple pulp from the juicing process gets turned into decorative edible cakes for the cocktails. And they will make syrups with expired wines. All of these efforts involve Kaessner’s work, Neves said. Water Witch even makes it own ice, using a “nerdy” water filtration system, a Clinebell ice machine and a large stainless-steel bandsaw, as an economic way to get the clearest, most long-lasting ice possible, Neves said. “It’s a pretty wild menu. We just try to have fun with it and keep it creative and light on its feet and give somebody a new experience every time they come in,” he said. Utah semifinalists missed the cut Three other semifinalists from Utah in the national categories didn’t make it to the nominee lists: Lavanya Mahate, owner of the Saffron Valley Indian restaurants; Adalberto Diaz, co-owner, founder and executive chef of the bakery Fillings & Emulsions ; and small-plates Greek restaurant Manoli’s . Five Utah chefs were included among the 20 regional semifinalists in the Best Chef: Mountain category, which covers Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming: • Mike Blocher and Nick Fahs, Table X , 1457 E. 3350 South, Salt Lake City. • Andrew Fuller, Oquirrh , 368 E. 100 South, Salt Lake City. He was nominated in the same category in 2023 . • Matthew Harris, tupelo Park City , 1500 Kearns Blvd., Park City. • Nick Zocco, Urban Hill , 510 S. 300 West, suite 100, Salt Lake City. In 2024, Zocco was named as a finalist in the same category . The winners of the awards will announced at the James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards ceremony on June 16 in Chicago.

Islander Photo: Courtesy Bradenton Beach Tensions are rising in Bradenton Beach, where some business owners proceeded with the construction and operation of commercial projects without city permits. Darin Cushing has been chasing down unpermitted issues since becoming the city building official in December 2023. “I’m trying to get tracks down in front of these moving trains,” Cushing said March 27. “People are doing the work first and then getting cited for it and then applying for the permits.” He said the result of not following the permitting procedure is a process that takes longer for the applicant while making extra work for city staff. Most recently, a bar opened at the Bradenton Beach Marina, 402 Church St., owned by developer Shawn Kaleta. Cushing told The Islander April 1 that the buildout requires “a commercial renovation permit along with electrical, plumbing, and mechanical subs.” He said the application will need to be reviewed by the city building and zoning departments and the fire district. Cushing added, “Then, if approved, we would issue the permit and work could begin.” Cushing said he learned of the bar March 26 from a Facebook post that was promoting the bar’s opening. He then walked over to the marina. “I went to the back and took a look at it and saw that it was definitely there. So I got a hold of the fire marshal and his inspector and a code enforcement officer and we took a look at it,” he said. Cushing said he put a cease-and-desist order on the bar. He said along with permitting, the marina needs engineered drawings showing a separation between the bar and dry boat storage for fire safety purposes. He also said the fire marshal observed that the fire suppression system is in alarming condition and had previously been red-tagged for pipe corrosion. Kaleta, with associates, owns and operates multiple island businesses and is developing the planned Bridge Street Resort. He bought the marina in January 2023. Cushing said aside from the cease-and-desist order for the marina bar, violations also have been an issue at Kaleta’s Bradenton Beach restaurant, Salt Bar & Table, 2519 Gulf Drive N., for unpermitted outside seating. He said an application was made for additional outdoor seating, but the permit was never approved because the application lacked a parking plan. “He never got approval for the outdoor dining” and it’s open and serving customers,” Cushing said. Meanwhile, Beach to Bay LLC, owned by Kaleta, received notices of violation in February for the unauthorized establishment of paid parking lots in areas zoned for residential use. Cushing said temporary use permits were applied for after the construction and operation of the pay-by-plate lots and most were approved March 21 by commissioners. The Islander reached out March 29 to Kaleta and his attorney Louis Najmy. Najmy spoke to The Islander but was unable to comment while on vacation. But Kaleta is not the only one under scrutiny. Cushing said permit violations also were issued to George and Wendy Kokolis, owners of the Gulf Drive Cafe, 900 Gulf Drive N., for the establishment of a paid parking lot across from the cafe — administered by Josh LaRose, owner of the EZ Parking Group. LaRose administers paid parking interests for multiple businesses in Bradenton Beach, including Kaleta and restaurateur Ed Chiles. Cushing said he approached LaRose to address the unpermitted lot and told LaRose he must remove vehicles and barricade the lot until a permit application is reviewed and approved by the city. The Islander reached out to the Kokolises March 29 but, as of The Islander press time April 1, no response was given. “We want to work with people. I am absolutely 100% pro-development,” Cushing said. “I like to see improvement and new construction. I am all for it. But it has to be done right, by the rules and laws on the books.” More from The Islander April 2, 2024 Holmes Beach details added parking, roadside improvements April 2, 2024 1st responders report calm amid crowds over spring break April 2, 2024 Anna Maria in haze on cannabis codes September 9, 2025 Body of missing Bean Point swimmer recovered Facebook Twitter Subscribe 3 thoughts on “ Bradenton Beach business owners under city scrutiny over lack of permits ” GKeith123 April 7, 2024 at 8:49 pm Every time I  read about some trouble with permits or town ordinances being violated its this guy and his lawyer.  Town government is a joke! Hope Mr. Cushing is successful within diligence. Or then again he might just take the payoff. Just don’t be a money spending tourist and mis interpret the myriad parking regs. You be ticketed in a flash. Glad I was a tourist in AMI long ago when it was still civilized.

Gina Mariani April 2, 2024 at 11:11 pm Its actually a free for all kaleta started it and now why not jump in, maybe if you had some serious consequences instead of “oh boy we got caught now we have to pay the permit fee and fine” He doesnt care its part of doing business.

      "text": "How did restaurant owner Salt Bae end up holding the World Cup in 2022? - The Athletic Premier League Transfer News Champions League Women's Football F1 Men's World Cup NFL Sailing Global Sports Tennis Golf Cricket International Football Live Cycling Europa League La Liga Bundesliga Serie A Championship League One League Two NBA NCAAM MLB NHL MLS NWSL Sports Business Sports Betting Gaming Boxing MMA Memorabilia & Collectibles NCAAF College Sports Motorsports NASCAR Culture Olympics FPL FIFA Club World Cup Women's Euros The Alternative PL Table The Making of Oscar Bobb PL One-Time Wonders How did restaurant owner Salt Bae end up holding the World Cup in 2022? By Nick Miller Dec. 18, 2024 Share 132 Burak Yilmaz was the first. The first of many. Baetient Zero, if you will. April 28, 2013. The then-Galatasaray forward started a trend which in the subsequent decade has swept through the football world, taking in Kylian Mbappe , Lionel Messi , David Beckham, Gianni Infantino, Karim Benzema, Ronaldo, Jose Mourinho, Diego Maradona and Paul Pogba, among many, many others. Advertisement Yilmaz was the first footballer to feature on the Instagram account of Istanbul-based butcher Nusret Gokce, or as you probably better know him — Salt Bae. There’s an innocence to that photo. You might not even recognise it’s Gokce. The hair is still swept back although more loosely, not looking like it’s been slicked down with goose fat. The little beard is present, but slightly more unkempt. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nusr_et#Saltbae (@nusr_et) But the weird circular sunglasses are absent. There’s a smile on his face, rather than an intense lack of expression/a curled upper lip, which is presumably supposed to be sexy. He’s wearing an apron, rather than a spray-on white t-shirt showing every undulation of the perfectly crafted muscles beneath. He’s just a bloke who runs a restaurant, delighted that a famous footballer has chosen to dine there. It’s quite endearing really. How did we reach the point, nearly 10 years on from that photo and two years ago today, where the same guy somehow made it onto the pitch after arguably the greatest World Cup final of all time, mithering Messi in his moment of absolute triumph, pestering Angel Di Maria for a photo, wrestling the trophy from the hands of Cristian Romero and pretending to sprinkle salt on it? View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nusr_et#Saltbae (@nusr_et) If you look at the pictures of those Argentina players in the afterglow of the high point of their careers/lives, they’re all (sort of) smiling, but nervous smiles, glancing at this pitch invader with a look that seems to say, ‘What the hell are you doing here?’ It’s a good question. How did it reach the point where a restauranteur from a small town in the east of Turkey gatecrashed the World Cup final? Why was — and is, to a point — football fascinated by Salt Bae? The original Nusr-Et restaurant, which opened in 2010, is in a relatively well-to-do suburb north of Istanbul called Etiler. Over the road there’s a restaurant called Celebrity, which feels a little on the nose. To the right of the entrance is one of the dining spaces, decked out with lots of shiny black surfaces and chairs with red, green and gold tassels. It looks like Tony Montana’s parlour. There is a big bowl of salt on each table, like it’s an hors d’oeuvre. Advertisement The staff are all very pleasant, but in a hurry and quite keen to direct the diner’s eye towards the section of the menu with the spicier prices — not unusual in high-end restaurants, but it’s noticeable how their enthusiasm wanes once they realise you’re going to order something more modest. If you do go for an expensive enough steak, someone who isn’t Salt Bae will come out and do the Salt Bae ‘bit’, slicing your meat theatrically at the table and doing the sprinkling of salt off the elbow thing. It’s a bizarre sight, like watching a tribute act called something like Naylor Drift play ‘Shake It Off’. On the night I visit, the gold-encrusted giant tomahawk steak would have set you back 9,750 Turkish lira, which at the time worked out at around £238, or $292. In relative terms that’s a bargain, given that the version in London went for £1,450 ($1,945), before it was taken off the menu, leaving the most extravagant item as the plain old boring non-gold encrusted giant tomahawk, for a mere £630 ($845). But the limits of The Athletic’s expenses policy (plus basic human decency) prevent me from ordering anything quite that pricey, so I go for something slightly more reasonable. And it’s fine. Nice, even. An absolutely edible piece of meat. Not the best you’ll ever eat, but definitely not the worst. It’s a perfectly good steak, but you don’t build a restaurant empire with locations in 14 different cities on perfectly good steak. And you don’t have gift shops in perfectly good steak restaurants either. To the left of the entrance there’s a section where you can buy a variety of Salt Bae branded merchandise, including various items of clothing (such as a slightly incongruous Christmas jumper, given this was in May), an apron, an array of knives, a knife sharpener and, somewhat inevitably, a set of Salt Bae salt shakers. I ask the maitre’d why footballers seem to love Gokce and Nusr-Et so much. With a big smile he says, “Because we do the best meat!”, which seems like a slightly unconvincing answer. Advertisement The real answer to that question stems from one of his earliest backers, a man called Ferit Sahenk. Sahenk is one of Turkey’s richest men, with a list of interests as long as your arm, but for our purposes the two most relevant of those are being on the board at Fenerbahce for a couple of years in the early 2000s and being an investor in Nusr-Et. Ferit Sahenk, (left), pictured in 2017 with former Fenerbahce head coach Zeljko Obradovic and chairman Aziz Yildirim (Onur Coban/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) To give his investment a little helping hand, Sahenk would invite an assortment of celebrities, other directors of football clubs and, of course, footballers to dine at the restaurant. Getting famous people to have their picture taken at your eatery is a tactic as old as the hills. They would go, be given VIP treatment, perhaps not exactly pay market rate for their dinner and would either post about it themselves on their social media or pose with Gokce for his. Gokce would then tend to accompany the pictures with captions explaining how much the celeb in question enjoyed their dinner. Initially, the visiting diners were local Turkish players, but this is where the Turkish Super League’s love of a big name comes in. Over the following years most of the ageing stars who had joined one of Istanbul’s big three clubs would drop by: Felipe Melo, Raul Meireles, Lukas Podolski, Dirk Kuyt, Robin van Persie, Wesley Sneijder, Didier Drogba. By 2014 he already had a restaurant in Dubai, but it wasn’t until early 2017 that his personal celebrity exploded. He posted a video called ‘Ottoman steak’, which showed him slicing a cut of meat in that silly, affected manner, sprinkling salt with his arm bent like he’s pretending to be a snake for a child, wearing the now standard issue white T-shirt and round glasses. It went viral, getting north of 17 million views. He became a meme, and for a while everyone seemed to be doing the salt thing, not least footballers. Danny Welbeck , Dimitri Payet, the entire Bayer Leverkusen team and Marseille defender Doria all incorporated it into their goal celebrations. Beyond football, NFL star Travis Kelce, tennis player Frances Tiafoe and the Welsh rugby team were among those Salt Baeing. Chef Kelce! #ProBowl pic.twitter.com/WJdA63hlFy — NFL (@NFL) January 30, 2017 The upshot of this was that people started seeking out his restaurant as a sort of internet-inspired ‘experience’, rather than just dinner. And this is really where his popularity among footballers is rooted. If you’re a professional athlete, going out for a meal often isn’t as much about the food as it is for the rest of us. You probably can’t have the burger, or the side of mac and cheese, or a bottle of wine. It’s more about the experience, and when these young men and women see something (they think is) cool online, they want to do that thing, to have that experience. They want to participate in the meme. It becomes self-perpetuating: it’s the ‘place to go’, so more people go there. An inexhaustive list of footballers who have enjoyed the Salt Bae experience and posed with the man himself includes Messi, Ronaldo (Brazilian), Robert Lewandowski , Roberto Carlos, Roberto Mancini, Pogba, Thibaut Courtois , Mbappe, Benzema, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Cesc Fabregas, Riyad Mahrez, Mario Gotze, Radamel Falcao, Virgil van Dijk , Megan Rapinoe, Sergio Ramos, Zinedine Zidane, Franck Ribery, Gareth Bale, Marcelo, Luka Modric , Maradona, Beckham, Fabio Capello, Ashley Young , Jorge Mendes, Ronaldinho, Mikel Arteta, Javier Zanetti, Edgar Davids, Casemiro , Lisandro Martinez , Phil Foden , Kaka, Luciano Spalletti and Jose Mourinho. Basically most of the footballers or managers you have heard of. And his influence goes — or at least went — right to the top: Gokce’s relationship with Infantino is probably worth an article on its own. Advertisement The FIFA president was not only a regular diner at various Nusr-Et venues in the years leading up to the Qatar World Cup, but a prolific picture taker with and fawning disciple of the man himself. In January 2021 he called Gokce “the best of the best, legend number one”. A couple of days before the final in December 2022, the pair appeared in a lengthy video in which Infantino declared: “Football unites the world, Nusret unites the world… he’s the best. He’s my brother.” 😎 ¡Ni Infantino se resistió al Saltbae! 🥩 El presidente de la FIFA no desaprovechó la oportunidad de disfrutar de los manjares de @nurs_ett🤏 (Vía | IG | nurs_et) pic.twitter.com/YnGqyxtId7 — Telemundo Deportes (@TelemundoSports) January 6, 2021 They were seemingly so close that Infantino personally invited Gokce to the final in December 2022 but, as with many of the great love stories of our time, the beautiful relationship appears to be over. After the stunt at the Lusail Stadium, Infantino promptly unfollowed Gokce on Instagram (although he does still follow Arnold Schwarzenegger, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Kim Kardashian), and FIFA issued a stern statement to the New York Times’s Tariq Panja , saying, “Following a review, FIFA has been establishing how individuals gained undue access to the pitch after the closing ceremony at Lusail Stadium on 18 December. The appropriate internal action will be taken.” Panja then commented that ‘the internal review will likely find some junior figure to blame’, which turned out to be very prescient. According to a report on the football website Josimar , the blame was placed squarely on a man called Ersan Gokay, whose day job at FIFA was in the finance department but during the men’s World Cup was a “senior event controller”, which essentially means he guided the various “legends” that FIFA invites to these occasions. Gokce was not part of the group that Gokay was responsible for, but according to Gokay he insisted he be escorted pitchside so he could “congratulate” the Argentina players. Gokay told Josimar: “In the chaos after the final, everyone wanted something and Salt Bae said he wanted to congratulate the players because he had a big passion for Messi and Argentina . Some of the players dined in my restaurant, he said. They all know me. “Do you realise how problematic that moment was? He was the president’s guest and he could complain to Infantino afterwards if I had denied his request. I had to be careful with him. I said: ‘You do not enter the pitch’. I never thought that he would do what he did on the pitch.” Advertisement Gokay then lost sight of Gokce for a second, at which point he found his way onto the pitch, and we all know what happened after that. The blame was placed on Gokay, who claimed he later received a letter saying the incident had inflicted “significant damage to FIFA’s reputation and intangible assets”. He was punished with an official warning, his World Cup bonus was halved and he was banned from “all official events until 2026 except for his ‘financial related roles'”. Gokay later went on sick leave because of the stress of dealing with that situation, and subsequently having been removed from his role as finance director of the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Gokay and FIFA then entered discussions about his departure, but in April 2024 he sent an email to all FIFA staffers making a variety of allegations against senior officials. He was fired with immediate effect two days later. FIFA then issued a statement to Josimar which said, “The total lack of judgement and common sense in addition to a complete misunderstanding of duties and responsibilities displayed by the employee in question during that incident has been demonstrated again in an email shared with members of FIFA staff containing baseless factual inaccuracies and allegations which are unfounded. They are a frustrated response to the inevitable dismissal due to repeated misconduct of an employee.” When contacted by The Athletic for their response to what Gokay said and the Josimar article, a FIFA spokesperson said: “FIFA does not comment on internal employment-related disputes or matters. Nevertheless, we wish the former employee well and the best in his future endeavours and thank him for his years of service.” While Gokay might have been technically at fault for losing track of Gokce as a defender might lose a striker at a corner, ultimately this was Infantino’s responsibility. By giving Gokce VVIP status at the showpiece event in the men’s calendar, what did he expect to happen? Gokce’s brand has been essentially built on having his picture taken with famous footballers: this was the final boss of that genre. Infantino professing to be shocked that one of the world’s most incorrigible publicity seekers tried something like this feels… well, a little naive. Advertisement The Athletic asked FIFA about the current nature of Infantino’s personal relationship with Gokce, whether he takes any responsibility for what happened and the steps they have taken to ensure something similar does not happen in the future. They declined to comment. For his part, Gokce has actually displayed a thin slice of contrition since. In an interview with The Times (of London) in June 2023 , he said, “I love Argentina; I’ve lived there. I went to support them. Many of (the team) have come to the restaurant. I didn’t feel a stranger. It was a special moment. “I can’t do anything about the reason I was there, but I would never, ever step on the World Cup pitch again. There were two billion people watching the World Cup… How many people are speaking about me? Five billion. The whole world.” According to the interviewer, Julia Llewellyn Smith, that last part was said in the context of being embarrassed by the stink he had caused, rather than a boast. Still, he hasn’t been ostracised by the entire football community. He managed to get himself into the VIP section at the 2024 Champions League final at Wembley, snagging pictures with Raul , Cafu, Kaka, Ronaldinho, Luis Figo, a bemused-looking Rafa Benitez, UEFA supremo Alexander Ceferin and FA president Debbie Hewitt, who he described as a “great, amazing president”. He also signed autographs for fans outside the stadium. It was a busy week in UEFA land for him: a few days earlier he was a guest at the Conference League final as Olympiacos beat Fiorentina, celebrating with Evangelos Marinakis, the owner of the victorious team. Gokce himself did not respond to requests for an interview for this story, and his representatives turned down a couple of approaches. And it’s quite difficult to get people to talk about Gokce. A few people who knew him in the early days in Istanbul declined to speak with The Athletic about him because they had nothing good to say. One of those people still classed themselves as a ‘friend’ of his. “He has just changed so much,” said another, who wished to remain anonymous to protect their relationships. Advertisement Others did speak, but on the condition that their words were not quoted, not even anonymously. Information they gave has been used in this article. Then again, others who recently worked and currently do work with him also declined to speak, this time because they wished to remain loyal to him. One person who recently stopped working with Gokce declined The Athletic’s invitation to talk about him in what we’ll call “robust terms”, citing their fondness for him. “I never, ever wanted to overshadow anything,” Gokce told the Times. “I didn’t like the attention.” Without meeting the man himself (again, he and his representatives turned down interview requests for this article), it’s difficult to say how true that final remark is, but based on his actions it is tricky to take his words at face value. There are a few ways of looking at Nusret Gokce’s most infamous stunt, two years on. You could employ some cod psychology, and take yourself inside his mind on that day in 2022: here was a boy from a relatively remote corner of the world, who grew up poor but who had harnessed the undulations of modern culture and technology to make himself into one of the most famous restaurant owners on the planet and a celebrity even beyond that — a self-made man who had ascended to the point of the most powerful man in football inviting him to its biggest occasion. You could also think Gokce is a chancer who found his way into the favour of those with influence, and who has gathered the reflected glow of celebrity and absorbed so much of it that he now possesses that glow. You could think of Gokce as a symbol of a particular kind of celebrity, the sort of loud self-publicist that has always existed, but the internet and meme culture has allowed to ascend to these levels. And you could think all of those things at the same time. They’re not that different, really. It just depends on your perspective. Advertisement Whatever you think of him, it’s easy to see how a decade of this building could coalesce in his mind to form a rush of power and self-delusion. It’s easy to see how, having reached a level of notoriety where people of Messi’s stature actively seek him out, he would think, ‘Sure, this is the moment of triumph for perhaps the greatest player to ever play the game, but I deserve to share that moment with him.’ There are very specific rules about who is allowed to touch the World Cup trophy, limited to those who have won it and selected heads of state and dignitaries: in that moment, thanks to the power of his specific type of celebrity — plus how some of the people on that pitch had sought his restaurants out as a destination and an experience — Gokce probably sincerely thought, ‘Yes, I belong here’. Gokce says he won’t pull that kind of stunt again. Maybe he is genuinely embarrassed about how he inserted himself into Argentina’s celebrations two years ago.
