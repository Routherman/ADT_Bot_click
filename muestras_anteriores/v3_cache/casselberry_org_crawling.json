Our Mission BelongÃ³ is dedicated to performing, educating about, and preserving the music of all of the Americas, emanating from African and indigenous roots, through the entry point of jazz. BelongÃ³ embraces its mission with a commitment to social justice, equity, inclusion, and the equality of all cultures worldwide. BelongÃ³'s mission is reflected by its core values of cultural inclusiveness, ground-breaking creativity, social consciousness, excellence, and responsible stewardship, and purposeful engagement. our journey Our Origins From 2002 to 2007 Arturo OâFarrill & The Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra were resident artists at Jazz at Lincoln Center where they performed an extensive schedule in New York and across the country while on tour. In 2005, the orchestra recorded its first GRAMMY-nominated album, Una Noche Inolvidable. Our Founding Principles In 2007, Arturo OâFarrill founded the Afro Latin Jazz Alliance (ALJA), a non-profit organization dedicated to expanding awareness of the genre by performing, educating about and preserving the music emanating from African and indigenous roots through the entry point of jazz. All About Education In 2009, the Afro Latin Jazz Academy of Music (ALJAM) was founded to offer music instruction to schools and other sites with music programs. Shortly after, Arturo OâFarrill founded The Fat Afro Latin Jazz Cats Youth Orchestra Program, bringing musical training to the next generation of aspiring musicians. Music For New York & Beyond By 2020, ALJA had provided institutional support to the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra and developed programs across all five boroughs, including those for the cityâs children. We have also produced concerts and performances in the New York area, across the country, and around the world. Taking it Online In 2020 we established the ALJA Digital Village, an online series created to raise awareness for the music genre through performance and education. In 2020, in response to the pandemic, we launched Virtual Birdland, a weekly, free online event with our musicians playing from diverse locations. An Organization On The Move As of our 15th year anniversary in 2022, our musicians had performed over 870+ performances and reached an audience of over 1M viewers; we had provided music lessons to over 20,000 + K-12 students and are currently present at 21 NYC school districts; We have an archive library of over 750 scores spanning over 16+ genres along with a significant collection of music related memorabilia. In 2023, Arturo and the orchestra received their 7th GRAMMYÂ® award for Best Latin Jazz album. A Bright Future Ahead To build upon this momentum, we are embarking on our next phase of growth to lead the artistic, educational and community nexus that celebrates Latin music, arts & cultures. This mission will transform our organization and allow us to expand our reach and impact by making our education, presentation and preservation activities available to an ever-expanding group of stakeholders. Our Rallying Cry To mark this transformation moment in our journey, we are focused on building awareness of Afro Latin Jazz and changing our organizationâs name to BelongÃ³, our rallying cry to break down barriers and reaffirm our commitment to cultural diversity, equity, inclusion fueled by creativity, excellence, and purposeful engagement. our team Arturo O'Farrill Founder & Artistic Director Marietta Ulacia Executive Director Stefan Andemicael Director of Operations & Administration Andrea Thompson Director of Development Andrew Andron Director of Artistic Planning Jamie Ehrenfeld Director of Education Alberto Miranda Production and Tour Manager Thalia Bloom Manager of Education Programs Isabel Rolston Manager of Institutional Giving Eduardo Almonte Marketing & Communications Manager Jackie Jorgenson Social Media and Content Manager Alexandria Arroyo Executive Assistant & Board Liaison Kevin Gay Data Management our Consultants Zack OâFarrill Youth Orchestra Leader Youth Orchestra Leader Fred Miller Arturo O'Farrill Artist Management Arturo O'Farrill Artist Management Diane Thompson Corporate Relations Corporate Relations Felipe TristÃ¡n Classical & Creative Partnerships Classical & Creative Partnerships Mike Perez Data Management Data Management Sergio Matos Graphic Designer Graphic Designer Unlimited Myles Booking Agent Booking Agent Our board Eduardo Castell Chairman Managing Director The MirRam Group Ramki Muthukrishnan Treasurer Head, U.S. Leveraged Finance S&P Global Ratings Marc Landis Secretary Managing Partner Phillips Nizer, L.L.P.

Website Sign In Search Government Services Community Business How Do I Home Government Departments Public Works Green Up Casselberry Program Adopt-a-Tree Program Adopt-a-Tree Program Want a free tree in your yard? The City of Casselberry has a program to provide free Florida native trees for residents! Click here to apply for a tree. Applications for the 2025 cycle are due by August 31, 2025. To view trees offered under this program and their approximate sizes at planting, click here . Caring for your Florida-Friendly Tree Right tree/Right place :  Select a location considering mature size, as well as light and water needs. City staff can assist in confirming right tree/right place for your property. Yard Disturbance :  Keep in mind when the tree is planted, the hole may be three times the width of the container or root ball for the tree. Also, the top of the container soil/root crown of the tree will sit even with or slightly above the surrounding ground level. Soil : Once tree is planted, DO NOT add soil to the base of the tree or cover the root crown. Mulching : A common mistake in tree care is piling mulch over the root crown/base of the tree. Add mulch (e.g., pine straw) to the disturbed area instead. Watering New Tree : Water the planting area immediately after planting and at least daily for the first two weeks, then every other day for 3 months. After 3 months, weekly watering of 6-9 gallons per inch of trunk diameter until established (approximately 1 year from planting) and during dry periods is recommended. Watering After Establishing : Some trees are more drought resistant than others. Once the tree is established, water according to its individual needs (see specific information on individual species at www.casselberry.org/greenup or ask City Public Works staff for more information). Pruning : Do not over-prune your tree. The intent of this Adopt-A-Tree program is provide more tree canopy in the City, especially that can be enjoyed by the public (e.g., walking on a sidewalk). A common mistake is completely cutting back trees (such as crape myrtles) annually. This is unnecessary and may harm certain trees. General guidelines for proper pruning practices can be found at https://www.arborday.org/trees/tips/keys-to-pruning.cfm Pest/disease problems : Trees that tend to have a lower disease potential were purposely chosen for this program. However, if a disease or pest issue is suspected, contact Seminole County Extension volunteers for assistance Monday-Friday 9:00 a.m. - Noon and 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. at (407) 665-5550 or via email.

Even for evergreen trees, they will shed leaves over time, providing opportunities to reuse leaves as mulch .

During a tour with this group, Sandoval visited the American Embassy in Rome to defect from Cuba. He became an American citizen on December 7, 1998, and was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. Sandoval’s song “A Mis Abuelos” received Grammy Award nominations for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Arrangement. This composition was featured on his Grammy-winning album, Danzon . Other highlights from Sandoval’s discography featuring his compositions include Dear Diz (Every Day I Think of You) , Live at the Blue Note , Rumba Palace (Grammy 2007), and Hot House (Grammy 1998) His life was the subject of the film For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story , starring Andy García. Sandoval has won 10 Grammy Awards and been nominated 19 times; he has also received six Billboard Awards and one Emmy Award. Prior to the concert, some of the area’s greatest Latin visual artists will showcase their works in the Artista Siempre art exhibit.
