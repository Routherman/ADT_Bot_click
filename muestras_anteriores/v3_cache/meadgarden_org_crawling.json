Photos by: Jim Carchidi Mead Botanical Garden Director Announces Retirement By Jim Carchidi | February 21, 2025 Cynthia Hasenau will end her tenure this summer after 13 years fostering the growth and popularity of Winter Park’s renown garden experience. Photos by: Jim Carchidi Share This: Cynthia Hasenau spent 13 years overseeing capital improvements, managing operations, and expanding community engagement as executive director of Mead Botanical Garden . She will end her tenure this summer, leaving a legacy of growth that transformed Winter Park’s “best kept secret” into a local icon. The 47.6-acre property opened in 1940 and was originally made up of five donated parcels that were deed restricted to remain a garden honoring acclaimed horticulturalist, Theodore Luqueer Mead. It was gifted to the city in the early 1950s when the first management group could no longer continue proper maintenance, and later rescued from neglect by the Winter Park Garden Club. A group of community advocates was enlisted in 2007 to form new master plan for management and program development under the Friends of Mead Garden 501(c)(3). The group began a long term lease and partnership agreement with city in 2012 and was renamed Mead Botanical Gardens, Inc. Hasenau began volunteering with the group in 2011, spending 10 hours a week helping with administration and project coordination. “I was referred by a few friends in the community,” she told the32789. “I guess they thought it was a fit for my skillset.” She hails from Tampa, but her family is based in Kansas. “One of my grandfathers was a farmer and the other was head of soil conservation for the state.” She graduated from Kansas State University with dual degrees in business management and journalism/mass communications. She later attended Rollins College, earning a master’s degree in human resource management. Hasenau strolls through Mead’s new Legacy Garden with Board of Trustees Chair, Tom McMacken. Mead Botanical Garden Board of Trustees Chair, Tom McMacken, first met Hasenau while she was a volunteer. “Cynthia has been the glue that has allowed MBG to evolve from a small friends group to a successful non-profit organization,” he noted in a prepared statement. “Anyone who compares Mead Garden today to what existed 10 years ago would recognize what hard work and dedication can achieve. She leaves the garden with a strong foundation and an exciting future.” Hasenau’s professional resume includes two years as a training and development specialist at Darden Restaurants and nine years as employee relations, training, and health and safety manager for the Orlando Sentinel. She also served six years at Rollins, devoting three years as director for the Center for Lifelong Education & Corporate Learning Institute, and three years as director of management and executive education at Crummer School of Business. Hasenau credits the volunteers, who donate more than 8,000 hours toward maintaining and operating the property, for the success she’s had in her 13 years as executive director. Mead Garden features a balance between an Old Florida nature experience and a collection of unique botanical displays. Seeing its potential appeal to a diverse set of interests, Hasenau spearheaded several projects as executive director that include: The Legacy Garden tribute to the achievements of Theodore Mead. Acquisition of the Azalea Lodge at Mead Garden event venue, created as a revenue stream to support projects and programs. Signature community events including The Great Duck Derby, GROWvember Fallfest and Plant Sale, and growth of the Young Naturalist Summer Camp that now serves more than 550 children annually. The “Friends of Mead Garden” membership program, providing members with free access to over 345 gardens throughout the country. Among her favorite endeavors is the expansion of the Young Naturalist Summer Camp Program. Open to ages 5-11, the activities turn the garden into an outdoor classroom where hikes reveal the depth of knowledge within the natural world. The camp began in 2012 as a one-week offering serving 18 students and is now a six-week program serving 548 children with a waiting list of 150. “But it’s not about the numbers, it’s about the impact,” Hasenau said. “The kids learn, the have fun, and the experiences build their confidence and curiosity.” Mead Botanical Garden is celebrating its 85 th anniversary and Hasenau says details on special events and programming are in development. She credits her colleagues and the many volunteers who contribute more than 8,000 hours annually for all the success she has overseen. “This is absolutely not an individual effort, there are many supporters and contributors who make it all possible.” The Mead Gardens board has formed a search committee to find the next executive director. Hasenau will continue her involvement throughout the transition period and beyond as a volunteer. She sees retirement as an opportunity to travel and spend more time with family, but also wants to see what more can be accomplished under new leadership. “I’m still having fun and plan on staying active as a volunteer,” she said. “But the anniversary serves is an example of what is possible when you help each other. The land was donated, the hours are volunteered, and so many people came together over all those years to create something wonderful.” Share This: Have a story idea?

Membership Application & Requirements On-line Application Please read the Membership Requirements document above and apply online here. The TL Mead Community Garden One of the first community gardens in Winter Park, this garden provides organic vegetables and fruit for members to keep and to share.  Residents and their families rent a bed for a full year – 4 growing seasons.  They plant and maintain their 4 ft by 16 ft garden bed to be free of weeds and pests using organic practices. Gardeners have set aside a couple of the beds to grow produce for Second Harvest Food Bank and often donate excess from their own beds as well. This community garden was originally established as a Demonstration Community Garden, funded by the Winter Park Health Foundation, and managed by the Orange County / UF IFAS Cooperative Extension Service and Orange County Master Gardener Volunteers. In February, 2011, management transitioned to the membership, who formed an organization with bylaws and officers—a President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. The organization reports to the Board of Trustees of Mead Botanical Garden, Inc. If you have an interest in being a part of the community garden, please email  the Community Garden Board before applying for additional details on bed availability. Benefits of a Community Garden Gardening by itself is therapy and provides exercise through the process of maintaining a garden. Maintaining a garden bed will be a learning experience through formal and informal demonstrations and presentations throughout the year. Intergenerational and cross-cultural interaction will be encouraged in all participation, education and development phases of the Community Garden. Funding The Winter Park Health Foundation funded the budget for the Demonstration Community Garden in 2009 at $25,000 over three years. The TLM Community Garden Learning Center is registered as a member of the American Community Garden Association .

Support Membership Donate Volunteer Our Partners Rentals Contact History Flourishing in Winter Park Amid homes, businesses and academic environments, is Mead Botanical Garden. This garden, dedicated in 1940, began as about 50 acres of upland hammocks and lower wetlands, with streams, lakes and ponds. Theodore L. Mead is a world-renowned horticulturist who grew orchids and developed new varieties of caladiums, rare ferns, bromeliads, and other plants. After his death in 1936, two of his friends, Jack Connery, who T.L. Mead had met as an Eagle Scout, and Dr. Edwin Grover, philanthropist, civic leader and Professor of Books at Rollins College, sought a location not only to house Mead’s orchids, but also to develop a botanical garden in his name and memory. A sizable area bordering Pennsylvania Avenue, in which Howell Creek connects Lake Sue and Lake Virginia, seemed ideal. This lush habitat hosted an abundance of wildlife, including herons and egrets nesting around Lake Lillian, as well as small waterfalls created by a nine-foot drop between the two lakes in this pristine, wild expanse. Theodore L. Mead Donations of land The community wasted no time in expressing approval of Mr. Connery’s and Dr. Grover’s endeavor. Donations of land collectively comprising the park’s acreage were made by the following individuals: Senator Walter Rose, Winter Park Mayer James Treat, Mr. and Mrs R.F. Leedy, and Mary Bartels. Orange County donated an unused clay pit, an abandoned Winter Park city property. Building the park began with a $62,170 Works Progress Administration project grant for labor. Howell Creek was deepened and widened, and the wetland was drained, making it possible to cut three miles of trails, and to plant the beautiful azaleas we still enjoy today. Projects included leveling high ground to plant grass and designating a nursery area to supply future plantings of caladiums, cherries, azaleas and original plant collections from Mead. Cabbage palms provided the first fence posts and logs for the two gatehouses. Two greenhouses were added for Mr. Mead’s extensive orchid collection and buildings for the garden superintendents and caretakers were built. Dedication January 14, 1940 marked the dedication of the new Mead Botanical Garden. Many senators and representatives, including Senator Walter Rose of the Florida Legislature, attended. Dr. Grover, President of the Garden and Master of Ceremonies, honored numerous volunteers, including Winter Park Garden Club President Mrs. Raymond Stevens and Florida Federation of Garden Clubs President Mrs. Henry M. Griffin. Dr. Hamilton Holt, then President of Rollins College, also participated in the ceremonies. The garden’s gala opening drew a large crowd and hearty welcome. Flower shows and other outdoor events soon followed. On March 31, 1953, the garden was given to the City of Winter Park with the continuing deed restriction that it be maintained as a botanical garden. The Winter Park Garden Club has been meeting in the Garden for over 50 years. Members continued volunteer efforts, leading to the construction of a beautiful outdoor amphitheater, built in the shade of towering oak trees, and dedicated in 1959. This outdoor theater became the site for fashion shows, weddings and other social events, including a series of concerts conducted by the Florida Symphony Orchestra in 1967. Environmental Awareness Program In 1977, Orange County Public Schools and the Junior League instituted an environmental awareness program for sixth graders (eventually fifth graders). The children followed the trails and learned through hands-on experience about the plants and wild animals of Mead Garden. This program continued until 2009, with over 5,000 public school students coming through the garden each year. The program was one of the last painful cuts in the Public School budget. Other groups also sought this relationship with the unique natural setting in Mead Botanical Garden. Rotary, Boy and Girl Scouts and the Youth Conservation Corps have assisted with community activities to clean and restore the garden. The Youth Conservation Corps constructed a floating boardwalk through the marsh and helped rebuild the greenhouse. In 1982, City of Winter Park crews began work to maintain the garden. Two years later, the Red Pepper Garden Club installed a large billboard map with directions for visitors. These efforts were not enough however, and by 1988, Mead Garden had fallen into disrepair. Winter Park residents organized to restore their park, and Mayor David Johnston appointed a fifteen-member Mead Garden task force. The Orlando Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects assisted the group with a master plan to revitalize the garden. The plan provided for the needs of the park, including beautification, upkeep, conservation and management. The Mead Garden Preservation Association, Inc. was formed in 1991 to continue the work of the task force. In 1993, two new boardwalks were built, followed by bike and walking paths. Other improvements included parking, re-bricking the road entrance, fencing, picnic tables, new restrooms, and shelter. Restoring and Enhancing the Garden In 2003, the Friends of Mead Garden formed a new partnership with the city to focus on restoring and enhancing the garden. Building upon the past, and responding to a renewed civic awareness of environmental issues, the group, led by Beverly Lassiter, Linda Keen and Carol Hille, took a new look at possibilities in the green haven that is called Mead Garden. After an extensive master plan development process, the plan by PBS&J was accepted in 2007. The Friends of Mead Garden sponsored the first Duck Derby that same year. The Ducks havereturned every year since 2009 for re-runs (or re-swims), much to the delight of hundreds of families. Presently, the City of Winter Park’s Parks and Recreation Department maintains Mead Garden on a day-to-day basis. However, many individuals (notably Alice Mikkleson and Rene Kelley), volunteer organizations such as the Florida Native Plant Society, Winter Park Rotary, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, The Geneva School, various church groups and the Winter Park Garden Club have participated in cleanup workdays and special projects for garden enhancements. In 2008, the City decided to move the city maintenance facilities out of the garden. Funded in 2009, the work to move out was completed in 2011, and the maintenance building was repurposed as the Discovery Barn. That same year saw the beginning of the Young Naturalist Summer Camp program and the revitalization of the Greenhouse and Legacy Garden. In 2012, The Grove Performance Pavilion opened with a holiday concert by the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra. Future plans for the Garden include the clean-up of Alice’s Pond and the restoration of Lake Lillian and its surrounding wetlands. Who was T.L. Mead? Theodore Luqueer Mead (February 23, 1852 – May 4, 1936) was an important American naturalist, entomologist and horticulturist. As an entomologist he discovered more than 20 new species of North American butterflies and introduced the Florissant Fossil Beds in Colorado to the wider scientific world. As a horticulturist, he is best known for his pioneering work on the growing and cross-breeding of orchids, and the creation of new forms of caladium, bromeliad, crinum, amaryllis and hemerocallis (daylily). In addition he introduced many new semi-tropical plants, particularly palm varieties, into North America. The Wikipedia entry was written by our own history and horticulture volunteer, Dr. Paul Butler. Wiki Article Horticulture in Florida Mead had first visited Florida in 1869 on a butterfly collecting trip, where he had successfully captured his rarest specimen near Enterprise – a female of Papilio calverleyi; only one other specimen of that type had ever been found before. [1] He considered the climate there ideal for the growing of semi-tropical plants, so after marriage he moved to Eustis, Florida where his father had bought him an orange grove and land to develop and grow other plants. Income would come from citrus and the growing of other cash crops such as pineapples, leaving time for his experiments in horticulture. In 1886 he purchased eighty-five acres in Oviedo, Florida , close to Lake Charm where orange grove land was more fertile, choosing a location next to Edith’s aunt Mary. She had previously married Dr. Henry Foster owner of the Clifton Springs Sanitarium in New York State, and the couple were winter visitors to the Lake Charm area. At Lake Charm Mead grew many palms from seed and hybridized orchids , bromeliads , crinum and later, caladium , amaryllis and daylilies . He established a strong friendship with Henry Nehrling of Gotha, Florida with whom he collaborated on many plant experiments. Citrus in central Florida did well until the Great Freeze of 1894-5. Many growers abandoned their groves entirely, but Mead recognized that below ground artesian water at a constant 70 degrees might provide relief from frost and allow citrus trees to survive freezing temperatures. His engineering background led him to postulate that overhead water irrigation of the trees hanging with fruit could keep the fruit protected from damage at 32° within an ice cocoon regardless of how low the mercury fell. He successfully covered an acre of oranges, installed a pump and irrigation system, and proved the concept, the first known description [13] of a technique still used today.

Search The Grove at Mead Botanical Garden The Grove at Mead Botanical Garden, an open air pavilion designed for musical performance, theatrical productions, film viewings, educational programming, and community gatherings, will be located in the heart of the 47-acre public garden in Winter Park. It will serve FSYO as its preferred site for outdoor concerts. \"The Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra is honored to be a part of this project. The Grove will provide our young musicians with an opportunity to perform on a stage, surrounded by Mead Garden's beautiful landscape. We are grateful to be working with wonderful community partners that support arts and music education,\" said FSYO Executive Director Heide Evans Waldron. The Grove is one of the active components of the garden's master plan initiated by Mead Botanical Garden, Inc. This non-profit community volunteer group organized in 2003, originally as Friends of Mead Garden, to revitalize the public garden in partnership with the City of Winter Park. Planning for The Grove began in 2010 when FSYO, who had secured an initial funding source, approached the volunteer group and City of Winter Park. The three groups worked hand-in-hand on the vision and selecting the location for the venue. The Grove is located between the Lake Lillian wetlands and MBG's environmental learning center where the Mead Young Naturalist Summer Camp and other programs take place. Planning work is now underway to restore Lake Lillian. \"The Grove at Mead Botanical Garden will provide visitors and users the opportunity to experience a full-range of senses for performances and learning,\" said Bill Weir, president of Mead Botanical Garden, Inc. Phase I of The Grove project includes the 40' x 60' concrete performance venue. Phase II funding is being sought for additional site work, landscape and horticulture improvements. The Grove at Mead Botanical Garden will be available for community rentals when requests do not conflict with FSYO performance needs. Florida Symphony Youth Orchestras and City of Winter Park are partners with us in this $900,000 project. Under Music Director Andrew Lane, the Youth Orchestra will use The Grove as their preferred site for outdoor concerts. A friend of the orchestra has generously donated $250,000 toward construction. The Grove will take its place among the foremost botanical garden performance venues in the country. We invite you to join in creating this exciting legacy.

Mead (Photo:  Courtesy of the Willis family) The Archives is pleased to share this guest blog post by Dr. Paul Butler, the author of Orchids & Butterflies – the Life & Times of Theodore Mead. In this new biography, he gives readers a view of the personal life of Theodore Luqueer Mead, the scientist who inspired Mead Botanical Garden. Dr. Butler was recently awarded the Rhea Marsh and Dorothy Lockhart Smith Winter Park History Research Grant in recognition of this work. Thank you, Dr. Butler, for sharing your research and insights with us! ******* One of the major collections in the Rollins Archives concerns letters, orchid memorabilia and other papers relating to the life of Theodore L. Mead , whose legacy garden is here in Winter Park. Mead was one of the most distinguished entomologists and horticulturists of his day (1852-1936) and his achievements in establishing a world-class butterfly collection and a host of horticultural breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the floriculture of Florida have been well documented – see for example his Wikipedia page . In my new book, Orchids & Butterflies – the Life & Times of Theodore Mead , I’ve offered for the first time insights into Mead the person–how he lived and what made him tick, using as a basis much of the Rollins archival material. Dr. Butler holding a copy of his new biography of Theodore Mead                               (Photo:  Courtesy of Paul Butler) The incentive in writing the story of Mead came from my interest in horticulture, the discovery of Mead’s letters in the archives, and a chance encounter with a well-known Winter Park resident, Ken Murrah, performing a captivating historical reenactment of Theodore Mead. The historically accurate biography paints a vivid picture of what life was like as a Central Florida pioneer and citrus grower in the late 19 th century. The documentation of most of Mead’s life is still in Central Florida but an important later component resides at Coalburg in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia, the ancestral home of his wife, Edith Edwards Mead. This was a treasure trove of photographs and letters that allowed documentation of the last twenty years of his life. Edith Edwards Mead at Wait-A-Bit,  the Meads’ home in Oviedo, circa 1902. (Photo:  Courtesy of Winter Park History Center and Archives ) For Mead’s story, a “life and times” narrative seemed particularly appropriate. His lifetime achievements in entomology and horticulture were substantial and significant. As were his generosity of spirit and concern for others less fortunate than himself that endeared him to the communities in which he lived. The times in which he lived—the environmental, technological and cultural changes that took place during his eighty-year life—provided a fascinating backdrop to the narrative. He experienced the birth of photography and became an enthusiastic early adopter; he witnessed the harrowing death of his only child from scarlet fever, the scourge of juvenile mortality with at that time no known cure; and he became embroiled in the heated religious arguments that followed the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species . In this debate, from his own studies of environmentally-induced changes in butterfly variants, he took the side of Darwin and that brought him head-to-head in conflict with his evangelical mother. Orchids & Butterflies is the story of the man who kept Florida a “Land of Flowers” – a hybridizer of plants more skillful than Luther Burbank. Edwin Grover, Professor of Books at Rollins College for many years, was of the opinion that there wasn’t a garden or public park anywhere in Florida that didn’t bear his mark in some form or another. Theodore Mead holding an allamanda (Photo:  Rollins College Archives) Mead’s horticultural legacy garden opened to the public in 1940, proclaiming itself as “Florida’s Finest Garden Spot.” Among the things to see and enjoy in this paradise of tropical plants were 5,000 orchids, rare plants, ferns, club mosses, cycads and palms. The garden had large plantings of azaleas, gardenias, camellias, daylilies, caladiums and roses, clumps of candy-striped ‘Mead-strain’ amaryllis, and a winding half mile trail bordering a creek complete with miniature waterfalls. Highway maps at the time, given out free to tourists, showed the Garden as the only sight worth seeing in the Greater Orlando area, together with Sanlando Springs.

It will also be available for purchase from local retailers. Tagged Edith Edwards Mead , Mead Botanical Garden , Orchids & Butterflies , Paul Butler , Theodore L.

It describes, with wonderful photographs and illustrations, an unsung leader in the field of orchids and their hybridization.  Every young woman who has received an orchid corsage from her prom escort has Dr. Mead to thank.  We in Winter Park are indebted to him for leaving his plants to the community and is papers to Olin Library.  Thank you, Dr. Butler, for giving Dr. Mead the recognition he deserves.
