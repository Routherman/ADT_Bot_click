This article outlines some of the differences and responsibilities of the HOA and CDD. What is the difference between the Lake Bernadette Community Development District (CDD) and the Lake Bernadette Homeowners Association (HOA)?  They actually have both separate and shared responsibilities for our community. Lake Bernadette HOA The Lake Bernadette Community Association, also known as the HOA, helps maintain the Community and deals with overall conditions of the neighborhoods.  The HOA ensures that the Covenants and Restrictions are adhered to regarding the appearance and quality standards of the Community.  This includes areas such as yard maintenance, home appearance and upkeep, and parking. The HOA may issue fines to homeowners who don't abide by the Covenants and Restrictions and may even place a lien against the home for broken rules and unpaid fines. The dues paid to the HOA are used to cover expenses such as community trash, recycling pickup, property management, and legal expenses. The HOA Board of Directors consists of five Lake Bernadette homeowners who volunteer their time to manage the HOA. The HOA contracts with a management company, Greenacre Properties, Inc. who assists the board with the day-to-day operations of the community. CDD Information The CDD is a type of government entity that provides the Community its infrastructure such as roads, utilities, water management, street lighting and amenities such as the Club House, the playground and the pools. Staff who manage the Clubhouse and other amenities are employees of the CDD.  Additionally, there is a CDD district manager employed by Infamark, who provides for Lake Bernadette's infrastructure management. The CDD has a five-person governing board of supervisors elected by homeowners. The CDD allowed the developer to finance the cost of the community development with a tax-free municipal bond.  The \"bond\" is repaid by the homeowners in the community with each property charged an annual amount.  It shows on the homeowner’s tax bill each year and is collected by the Pasco County Tax collector. The CDD and HOA have complementary responsibilities and share some community responsibilities such as the maintenance of Golf Links Boulevard and the ponds. The Lake Bernadette Golf Club is an independent entity.  Also, neither the HOA nor the CDD have any policing powers. 0 HOA Community Contact Us The information on this website will help you navigate the ins and outs of community and living at Lake Bernadette HOA.

Reviewed January 09, 2024 Bought a home in Lake Bernadette 2 years ago , course was in poor shape then , but new owners were taking over soon, made some improvements the first year it ended there  , now course is going downhill again last year my season member ship was $ 1500 for 4 months( I am here 3 months in the winter)  got here this year and it's a 6 month membership for $ 2100. Restaurant is closed most of the time, no help they say , Management never says hello and most times they act like you are bothering them, I now Play at Silverado about 2 miles away , great condition and they are happy you are there, and the membership is cheaper , sad I was looking  forward to living on a course for my winters. Read More Robert K. Reviewed November 30, 2021 Read More Frank V. Reviewed September 07, 2020 Great course for the price. Friendly staff. Read More Gene A. Reviewed April 13, 2012 A disappointment...Greens were in rough condition, even had a temporary green on #9...A decent layout with some interesting holes but it needs alot of TLC.... The score cards have pin placements 1,2,or 3, but when we asked the starter which number was correct he said \" there is no number, its just random\"..No driving range, was a let down. Not priced down low enough to compete with other courses in the area that are in much better shape. Read More Austin W. Reviewed November 10, 2011 I played this course for the first time last week.  The course was extremely damp, but I think that may have been due to recent over seeding.  The course is fairly short, but plays fairly long due to frequent dog legs and forced layups.  Their are several tricky holes that will play very tough if you are not familiar with the course.  The course was in decent shape, a few greens are still being worked on, and there was some weeds growing in a few fairways but overall it was in pretty good shape.  The staff was friendly and my hot dog was pretty good, but the clubhouse is not going to impress anyone.  The best part of the experience was the pace of play.  I played on a beautiful Sunday morning at 10.  Normally playing at a public course in central florida at that time would mean a 5 and a half hour round.  We get through 18 in under 4 hours, not bad at all.  I'm not sure if it was an anomoly or not, but if this is the norm, we will be back for another Sunday round.  Good rates can be found online, we paid 20 a head on a weekend, and it turned out to be a great value.  I will definitely be back in the future. Read More Jim M. Reviewed June 13, 2011 My wife and I enjoyed this course we played at twilight and it was like we had the course to ourslves would go again. The only issue is they close the on course bathrooms down early. Kind of funny though we had to go track down the course ranger. Read More Larry D. Reviewed January 05, 2011 Tough course but could be be better. Clubhouse is a dog,and  prices too high for quality. Owner has a great course in Tallahassee, FL. too bad he didn't make this one to the same standards.
