Palm Beach County Day 2025 celebrated the countyâs sunshine state of mind by\r\n\t\tbringing our brightest and best to Tallahassee. However, two of our brightest and\r\n\t\tbest will be retiring before the next Palm Beach County Day. County Administrator Verdenia Baker retired on May 31 after 38 years of service to the residents of Palm Beach County and nearly 10 years as its Administrator. Mrs. Bakerâs service has helped make Palm Beach County a strong government with many resources. Ed Chase has played an essential role in Palm Beach County for decades. As the\r\n\t\tDirector of Intergovernmental Affairs and Community Engagement, he has led our\r\n\t\tlobbying efforts in Tallahassee and coordinated our lobby teams throughout the\r\n\t\tyear. Ed and Verdeniaâs efforts have forged Palm Beach Countyâs lobbying presence in\r\n\t\tTallahassee and have been essential in promoting the county to state lawmakers.\r\n\t\tWe wish them both a happy retirement. A special thank you to our sponsors who made the events happen. Also, thank\r\n\t\tyou to all of our attendees. Planning for next year is underway, and we hope you\r\n\t\twill start thinking ahead about sponsoring and attending Palm Beach County Day,\r\n\t\twhich will take place Jan. 13-14, 2026. 2025 Wrap Video Save the Date Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners Maria G.
