With numerous dog legs and water hazards throughout the course, your tee shots are of utmost importance during your round.  This will obviously give you your best chance to score well and leave with a smile on your face. Here is a quick recap of each hole here at Cypress Lakes. Front Nine Hole 1 Par 4 A short opening hole, it offers you a good chance at par or better.  A 200 yard shot off the tee will leave you with a short iron over water into this green.  Be aware of the out of bounds down the left side. Only roughly a 280 yard carry from the white tee allows you to be brave with the first shot of the day. Beware of the Muscle Shoals area winds though! Hole 2 Par 4 A tee shot down the middle or to the left side of this fairway is preferred.  Anything down the right side could find the water lining this fairway.  A mid to short iron into this green which slopes from back to front is preferred. Hole 3 Par 4 This is a sharp dog leg right that big hitters can cut the corner and leave themselves a short iron to this green.  However, you have to be careful of the bunker down the left side of this fairway.  A relatively flat green awaits approach shots. Hole 4 Par 5 This straight away hole offers a good chance at birdie that the long hitters may reach in two.  Make sure your aim off the tee is true and watch out for the fairway bunker on the right.  The green is at a slight angle away from the fairway that can make your approach shot trickier than it looks. Hole 5 Par 3 A short par 3 where you will only need a short iron to this undulated green.  Hitting the green will probably not be difficult, but the fun begins when the putter is in your hand. (NEW IN SPRING 2025… A NEWLY REDISGNED LARGER TEE COMPLEX) Hole 6 Par 5 Another reachable par 5 for the long hitters, you must hit the fairway to have any chance at going for it as trees line both the left and right side of the fairway in the landing area.  The green is guarded short and right by water.  This means most players will opt to lay up with an iron and leave a short iron to this two tiered green. Hole 7 Par 3 Par is definitely a good score here.  A mid to long iron is needed for this long par 3 with an island green that many feel is the signature hole of the course.  The green is big but has many subtle undulations that will challenge you once you are on the putting surface. Hole 8 Par 4 This hole plays much narrower from the tee than it appears.  An iron or fairway wood is the prudent play off the tee down the right side as anything left of center has a chance at going in the water that lines the left of this fairway.  If you can find the fairway, a mid to short iron is all you need into this relatively large green. Hole 9 Par 4 The front nine finishes with this short par 4 giving you a good chance at birdie.  With out of bounds down the left, some players may try to drive this green which is guarded by bunkers, both left and right, short of this green.  Any tee shot just past the tree line on the corner will leave you with a short iron into this subtly undulated green. Back Nine Hole 10 Par 4 The back nine begins with a tee shot that must find the fairway.  With water left this is no easy task.  Once in the fairway you will find yourself with a mid to short iron that must be hit high to hold this green that slopes devilishly from front to back.  Take a par here and run. Hole 11 Par 4 This is a sharp dog leg left with out of bounds down the left side.  An iron or fairway club should be hit just around the corner, anymore could find the water or be blocked out by trees on the right side of the fairway.  This will leave you with a short iron into this receptive green with a good chance at birdie. Hole 12 Par 3 This short par 3 is all carry over water and the front bunker.  The green is relatively large for this short hole with subtle breaks and is sloped from back to front.  Leaving here with anything above par will leave you scratching your head. Hole 13 Par 4 Many feel this is the toughest par 4 of the course and it is the #1 handicap hole on the scorecard.  With out of bounds right, a tee shot must go long or left of the bunker at the corner of this dog leg right but water looms through the fairway as well.  The second shot is a short to mid iron to a long green guarded by water on the left and bunker on the right.  Par here is an excellent score. Hole 14 Par 5 This is predominantly a three shot par 5 with trouble looming.  A big oak tree guards the left side of the fairway.  Out of bounds is down the entire right side of this hole and your lay up shot must be left or short of water that is situated 75 yards from the green.  That water goes all the way up the right side and is lurking to the right of the green as well.  Birdies can be made here but par is a good score. Hole 15 Par 4 Big hitters may find themselves going for it on this short par 4.  However, trees dot the right hand side of this fairway and a bunker surround the front of this green.  Out of bounds right must also be taken into consideration.  The better play may be to lay back and hit a short iron into this undulated green for your best chance at birdie.  This is a good risk-reward hole. Hole 16 Par 4 This is another short par 4 with a lot of trouble waiting.  Water and out of bounds go down the right side of this hole and a one lone bunker frame this fairway down the left.  The green is relatively small and is guarded by a grass bunker which is the remains of the former six-foot deep pot bunker called the “Devil’s Pit”. Hole 17 Par 3 This is another long par 3 where par is definitely a good score.  The tee shot is all carry over water, with water guarding the left side of this large green as well.  The green slopes from back to front, and right to left.  Take a par and run. (NEW IN SUMMER 2024 A NEWLEY EXPANDED TEEING COMPLEX TO ALLOW FOR A SHORTER HOLE.) Don’t let that fool you though. This is a green that was a short par 4 green in its past life. Hole 18 Par 4 This slight dog leg left is a strong finishing hole.  Stay away from the tree on the left to find the fairway here.  This will leave you with a mid to short iron into a large green with a small bunker guarding the front.  You definitely want to be in the proper quadrant of this green to ensure yourself of at least a two-putt to finish your round.

About Us Cypress Creek Golfers' Club was carefully carved from the mature hardwood forests and centuries old peanut fields of Smithfield. The peacefully secluded setting is the ideal environment for a round of golf and the challenging design will have you using every club in your bag. The golf course will reward creative shot-making and thoughtful strategy but it is not overly punishing for the high handicapper. The rolling terrain provides plenty of challenging ups and downs throughout and there are many water holes, including the memorable ninth, a short par 4 with an island green. Cypress Creek Golfers’ Club even has its own “amen corner” that starts with the par-4 15th, moves on to the waterlogged 16th, and finishes with another par 4, an uphill hole that is the toughest of the trio. ​ TOUR OUR COURSE Location 600 Cypress Creek Parkway Smithfield VA, 23430 Contact Us 757-365-4774 Golf@CCGCSmithfield.com ©2025 Cypress Creek Golfers' Club Join Our Team!
