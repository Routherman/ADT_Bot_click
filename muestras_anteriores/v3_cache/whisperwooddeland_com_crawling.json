This Plaza is the very proud reality of Whisperwood residents coming together, through many meetings, planning, fund raisers of many types and a whole lot of community cohesiveness. The completed Plaza was recognized at a large dedication celebration in April 2018. The residents are still very active in caring for the Plaza, planning and carrying out two special annual celebrations, Memorial Day and Veterans Day, to honor Veterans and all their Supporters. There is also a small ceremony on July 4th and a Golf Cart Parade. All residents, veterans and non-veterans, are invited to come to our periodic meetings and participate at will. Please take a moment out of you busy day to walk around the Plaza, read the bricks, touch the monument and to take time to sit and reflect on the essence of this magnificent Whisperwood Veterans Plaza. Flag Etiquette - Whisperwood Residents volunteer and care for the flags at the Veterans Plaza and at the Park entrance. Residents volunteer to be a monthly Flag Etiquette Captain. Captains are needed throughout the year. If you have any questions or would like to help with this, please contact Bill Felton @ 585.760.9090. Bricks - These bricks are surrounding the Veterans Plaza and have been donated by many veterans and veterans' families. Bricks can be requested and are available for any homeowner or family member who is a military veteran. The request forms are located on the bulletin board in the Clubhouse Library. If you have any questions, please call Bill Felton @ 585.760.9090. Veterans - If you are a military veteran of any branch, or know of a resident veteran, please contact Bill Felton @ 585.760.9090 or Ester Charbono @ 286.822.9791. Whisperwood Veterans White T-Shirts - If you are a veteran and are a homeowner in Whisperwood, you can get your first Whisperwood Veterans White T-Shirt for free. Please contact Terry Smith @ 386.738.5287 or Sandy Simoneau @ 286.822.9791. DVD of the Development of the Whisperwood Veterans Plaza - A DVD was developed which contains many pictures at different phases throughout the planning, development, and construction of this Whisperwood Veterans Plaza. It is really something to sit and watch this develop into a reality. This DVD is free to each military veteran who is a homeowner in Whisperwood Park and is available to anyone else who would like the DVD for a $5.00 donation. Just call Esther Charbono @ 386.738.3971. Plaza Shirts - A subcommittee is currently in the planning phase for developing, obtaining and distributing these Veterans Plaza Shirts.
