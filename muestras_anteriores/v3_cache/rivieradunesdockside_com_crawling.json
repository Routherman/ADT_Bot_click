We view owners as partners who, together with Dune, manage properties in a way that generates the highest financial returns by ensuring the property is competitively priced and broadly advertised to maximize revenue, while maintaining and enhancing property values. Our goal is to make “raving fans” of our guests and be the best vacation rental provider; that unlike larger companies has the ability to deliver customized services. We recognize the importance of understanding the unique differences and needs of each client and can custom tailor a program that meets your specific investment property objectives. We train our associates to manage and treat your home like it is their own with the goal of maintaining your property condition like it is a non-rental. PORTFOLIO: Our operating area is limited to 30A and focused specifically on the WaterColor®, Seaside®, WaterSound®, Rosemary Beach® communities and select gulf front properties. We are highly selective in adding properties that only meet the highest quality levels; and limit the number of luxury properties served in any one community to avoid overlap and competition between similar properties. An operating strategy that results in higher revenue for our owners who on average generate in excess of $250,000 in rental revenue each year. MARKETING: We believe, and are leaders, in multi-channel marketing. The majority of guests book directly with us through our website and “Dune Direct” guest loyalty program driven by significant investments in SEO, email, pay for click, social media and print advertising. In addition, we utilize 10 plus web-based advertising channels including VRBO/HomeAway® where we have earned premier partner status which is only awarded to the top 10% of management company providers. OPERATIONS: The core of our service delivery team are our property managers, who average 12 years of property management experience each, and who serve as your single point of accountability. Our maintenance team uses branded vehicles and fulltime, uniformed and trained personnel. Our maintenance philosophy is to self-perform as many services as possible and lower operating costs for owners; we maintain a staffing ratio of one tech per 15 homes ensuring responsiveness. Housekeeping is provided by small companies exclusively under contract with Dune. We assign the same cleaners to your home each week that are closely supervised and their work inspected by our property managers to deliver to an industry leading Dune standard of cleanliness. Linens and towels are of a luxury quality level and laundered off-site but managed and labeled specific to each home, eliminating linen pool expenses and quality problems. TECHNOLOGY: Dune Vacation Rentals is an industry leader in the use and application of technology in all facets of our business. Our cloud-based property management software platform enables us to easily manage and integrate multiple 3rd party marketing channels resulting in higher revenue for owners. Mobile applications for maintenance, housekeeping and guest management provide consistent and efficient management of core services. Dune Vacation Rentals use of 3D imaging and drone photography of properties under management, enhances property marketing including 360 views, virtual tours, floor schematics and use of virtual reality property viewing. COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: As a Company, Dune Vacation Rentals is committed to environmental sustainability, community service and the active support of programs and associations sponsored through volunteerism of our team members. Specific areas of service include the Easy on 30A benefit which supports The Sonder Project, Muscogee Nation of Florida, Lighthouse Family Retreats and the Alaqua Animal Refuge.

At the age of 15, Mike earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America and by that time had over 300 nights of wilderness camping experience.  His love for the outdoors turned into a passion for off-roading as soon as his first job earned him enough income to purchase his first sport ATV.  This first ATV started an addiction for rock crawling, trail riding and sand duning that still occupies 100% of Mike’s interest to this day. Garrett McGroarty Manager Garrett McGroarty was born into the “Idaho Dunes Way of Life”.  At 3 years old, Garrett started his off-road passion on a Kawasaki KFX 50.  Garrett has logged more trail miles between Idaho Dunes RV and West Yellowstone than anyone in the area.  At a young age, Garrett developed a passion for helicopters and aviation.  Before graduating from high school, Garrett earned both his private helicopter license (PPL-H) and commercial helicopter license (CPL-H).  With advanced pilot training from the best instructors in the industry at Helisafe in Southern California, Garrett has mastered the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopters flight systems and emergency procedures.
