Photo by Tim Aten Nearly two years in the making, Cavo Lounge in finally set to launch Monday, Aug. 31, in Mercato in North Naples. Photo by Tim Aten Posted: Aug. 12, 2015 0 Q: As a concierge here in Naples, I follow your column faithfully. Thank you for your diligent work! We drove by Cavo at Mercato, and it looks very close to being ready. Do you know anything as far as when the doors might open? We have eagerly been anticipating this one! Keep up the great work! — Margaret Cruz, North Naples A: Nearly two years in the making, Cavo Lounge in Mercato is almost ready for its big reveal at the end of this month. Monday, Aug. 31, is the launch date for the long-awaited nightspot. “We like to label it as an eclectic, upscale gastro lounge. It’s going to be a very cool, fun environment,” said Rocky Patel, co-owner of the new business in the popular North Naples development. The opening of Cavo will complete its Strada Place block, made up entirely of eateries and bars. This entertainment section in the heart of Mercato stretches from Taps Restaurant, Bar & Lounge to Bravo! Cucina Italiana, and from Second Cup to McCormick & Schmick’s. In between are The Counter Burger and Rusty Bucket Restaurant & Tavern, with Cavo forming a trio of lounges with its neighboring Blue Martini and familial Burn by Rocky Patel. “It’s almost like we have our own little Bourbon Street going on in Mercato,” said Jason Buro, Cavo’s general manager who relocated to Naples last year from New York. “I think this is going to be the new hot spot between Burn, Blue Martini and Cavo. It should become the entertainment trifecta,” Patel said. At 6,580 square feet under air, Cavo will be the third largest dining spot in Mercato, surpassed in size only by McCormick & Schmick’s (8,455 square feet) and Bravo (6,929 square feet). Cavo’s prominent patio area brings its square footage closer to 8,500, which was no easy feat to amass. Cavo’s space was cobbled from some undeveloped space in the large center island it shares with only Taps, as a few other smaller retail shops were redeveloped. To make way for the new lounge, Bio women’s clothing store moved across the street and Swim ‘n Sport apparel shop closed. Cavo was originally targeted to launch in early 2014, but the project faced setbacks, Patel said. “It was, unfortunately, some of the general contractors that caused undue delays on our end,” he said. Cavo is designed to be worth the wait. The lounge has tables and booths inside, as well as outdoor seating that wraps around its exterior. “The main beauty of the place is a big area with an indoor-outdoor bar,” Patel said. The overall look of the lounge, which features scores of seats at the bar, is designed to be eclectic and inviting. “It’s very conversational and very welcoming,” Patel said. “We’ve used a lot of different wood finishes. The bar has recycled antique wood with a pewter top.” Patel describes Cavo’s décor as a cool mixture of rustic Old World with exotic, modern accents. Cavo blends wood and pewter finishes, breaking up its wooden floor and ceiling with metal bar stools and light fixtures. “It’s a real beautiful mix of soft and hard natural elements,” Buro said. It’s no coincidence that Cavo will have a New York taste and feel. Patel co-owns the new lounge with Steve Tallides and Lawrence Cerullo, who are part of S Hospitality Group, which owns S Prime steakhouse and Studio Square beer garden on Long Island, as well as Cavo, an upscale restaurant in Astoria, New York. Although they share a name, Cavo in Naples will bear no resemblance to its New York counterpart, Patel said. The local Cavo, however, will feature New York-style food and chefs with a diverse menu of fun small plates from regions around the world. “The menu here is a very eclectic, international, small plate menu,” Buro said. Selections include a world tour: Korean chicken lollipops, Greek salad with saginaki, garlicky shrimp and grits, maple-glazed bacon satay, pork belly with pickled Napa cabbage, and cavatelli with wild mushrooms and mascarpone cream sauce. There also will be a charcuterie board, marinated skirt steak, lamb chops, grilled octopus and spicy tuna tartare. While the menu includes the obligatory flatbreads, its sliders offer twists with bratwurst, crab cake and short rib choices. Likewise, mini gyros are offered with pork, beef or chicken. The Cavo grilled cheese is upgraded with Fontina cheese, applewood smoked bacon and Granny Smith apples on brioche toast. Cavo is designed to be a relaxing restaurant that will seamlessly morph into a late-night lounge after 10 p.m. with an upbeat atmosphere. The lounge has specialized cocktails, including Margaritas and sangria on tap, Patel said. “It will be very much like a New York lounge, more like South Beach,” he said. “It’s going to be a very interesting place that Mercato has never seen.” Cavo’s drink specialties include cocktails such as the Bluebini, made with Stoli Blueberi vodka, Prosecco and blueberries; White Raspberry Truffle, which combines Ciroc Red Berry vodka with Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur and Chambord; and Poco Picante, which includes Don Julio Silver tequila, Grand Marnier, agave nectar, melon cubes and jalapeño wheels. Although Patel also owns the Burn cigar lounge next door, he said Cavo will operate as a separate entity with its own identity. In addition to its public operation, Cavo will be amenable to hosting private parties such as weddings or charity events, Patel said.
