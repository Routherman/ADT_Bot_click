      "text": "About | Untitled Art Fairs About Founded in 2012, Untitled Art is a leading contemporary art fair taking place annually on the sands of Miami Beach and in 2025, will expand to Houston. Guided by a mission to support the wider art ecosystem, Untitled Art offers an inclusive platform for discovering contemporary art that prioritizes collaboration within each aspect of the fair. Each year, new and long-standing exhibitors are selected by Untitled Art’s evolving curatorial team for their artistic integrity and international reach, with several galleries based outside of mainstream art hubs. Emerging artists, young galleries, and non-profit organizations are supported through its ‘Nest’ sector, an initiative offering subsidized booths developed in response to traditional entry barriers posed by art fair participation. The first to launch an online art fair, Untitled Art continually invests in new technologies to make contemporary art collecting more accessible to new audiences, and it proactively advances responsible culture by using its platform to amplify diverse voices. Through critical and educational programming, from a robust on-site podcast series focusing on relevant industry topics and artist talks to events and community activations outside of the fair itself, Untitled Art attracts contemporary art collectors, art professionals, curators, art historians, and critics, among other enthusiasts. It also celebrates the context in which the fairs are held by promoting leading galleries from Miami and Houston, as well as engaging with local institutions. To reduce its environmental impact, Untitled Art has joined the Gallery Climate Collation and works closely with the City of Miami Beach to ensure zero environmental impact. Untitled Edit, commissioned essays intended to spark debate and dialogue, also continues to further the critical advancement of art criticism while cultivating the next generation of writers. Miami Beach Founded in 2012, Untitled Art’s flagship fair takes place annually on the sands of Miami Beach. Known for its cutting-edge programming and curatorial integrity, the fair features noteworthy galleries and nonprofits from across the globe, showcasing emerging and established artists. The 14th edition of the fair will be held December 3 through 7, 2025 with a VIP and Press Preview on December 2. Houston Untitled Art, Houston is a boutique invitational fair that will debut from September 19 to 21, 2025 at the George R. Brown Convention Center. A VIP and Press Preview will be held on September 18. The fair’s expansion into Texas aims to engage new audiences across the city, state, and region, adding another cultural touchstone to one of the country’s largest, most diverse, and fastest-growing cities. Leading up to the fair, Untitled Art, Houston will stage a series of activations across the state and the broader region to highlight Texas’ vibrant contemporary art scene. Additional details on collateral events and the inaugural edition will be announced in the coming months.

REGISTRARME INICIAR SESIÓN Estados Unidos Cuatro ferias de arte para no perderse antes del fin de Miami Art Week Durante la semana del arte que transforma el sur de Florida, muchas muestras de los más diversos contenidos complementan la experiencia de Art Basel Miami Beach. Cuatro destacadas: Prizm, Miami River Art Fair, Art Beat y Fridge Por Leydi Torres 07 Dic, 2023 06:00 p.m. EST Guardar Miami Art Week 2023 es un epicentro cultural con más de 30 ferias de arte alrededor de Art Basel. (@nachomartinfilms) Miami Art Week 2023 es un hito cultural con la presencia de más de casi 30 ferias de arte internacionales que exhiben a miles de artistas. Desde que la prestigiosa Art Basel Miami Beach se convirtió en el núcleo de esta efervescencia artística, en 2002, cada vez más iniciativas han mostrado la potencia y el dinamismo de la cultura en el sur de Florida . Estas ferias satelitales no sólo complementan la experiencia del gran show de galerías globales, sino que ocupan nichos específicos para creadores y públicos diversos y, además, convierten en protagonistas a diversas localidades de Miami . Estos eventos representan una oportunidad única para que residentes y visitantes accedan a muestras artísticas de calidad que a menudo son el área de interés de coleccionistas y expertos. A su vez, dinamizan aún más la vida cultural de Miami , que se encuentra en un momento de crecimiento en numerosas áreas. Esta es una lista de cuatro ferias satélites que conviene aprovechar antes de que termine la Semana del Arte . Prizm Art Fair El tema de Prizm Art Fair 2023, \"La civilización no es civilizada\", invita a la reflexión sobre la sociedad moderna con obras como \"Time, Place and Us\", de Greg Bailey. La 11ª edición de la feria Prizm se destaca por abordar narrativas y perspectivas de la diáspora africana. Su edición 2023 tiene por tema La civilización no es civilizada, para abordar la naturaleza de las sociedades modernas que rara vez se construyen por consentimiento. Este evento reúne a 60 galerías que exhiben obras de artistas emergentes y establecidos. La feria se divide en cuatro secciones principales: Prizm Panels, Prizm Perform, Prizm Film y Prizm Preview, ofreciendo un espacio rico y diverso para el análisis y exhibición artística. Prizm , que se presenta en consonancia con Art Basel Miami Beach , actúa como plataforma para artistas locales e internacionales con un enfoque especial en aquellos de África y su diáspora , llevando las tendencias del arte a un público más global. La feria no solo contempla la exposición de obras, sino que también organiza una serie de eventos culturales en una de las semanas más influyentes del arte a nivel mundial. Para su edición de 2023, Prizm se presenta también en línea, durante una semana más allá del fin de Miami Art Week hasta hasta el 17 de diciembre en su sitio web.

En su duodécima convocatoria, esta feria se muda de ubicación, a The Penthouse Riverside Wharf , un espacio que proporciona espectaculares panorámicas de 360° del centro de Miami . El tema de 2023, Cosmos Hybrid Art Edition , se centra en la intersección entre arte y tecnología, se prestará especial atención a la inteligencia artificial , y contará con proyectos de NFT y stands virtuales . La organización del evento corre a cargo de Nina Torres , en alianza con la Fundación de Arte Contemporáneo (FCA). En la azotea de 11.000 pies cuadrados (más de 1.000 metros cuadrados) habrá también cabinas individuales para una selección de artistas seleccionados, un concept similar al de visitas a estudios, donde un creador destacado puede establecer contactos directamente con coleccionistas, curadores y profesionales del arte.

Hasta el 10 de diciembre, Art Beat Miami presenta una gama de artistas emergentes y consagrados en disciplinas como pintura, escultura, murales e instalaciones. El festival, que es una vitrina de talentos locales y de la diáspora, incluirá además performance, música, moda y gastronomía.
