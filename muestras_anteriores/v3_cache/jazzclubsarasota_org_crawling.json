Contact / “ The mission is clear, the communication is exceptional, and the willingness of staff and educators to find solutions and opportunities where others see problems is meaningfully apparent. ” — JazzED Parent Seattle JazzED Staff BJ Montoya, Curriculum Manager and Lead Teacher BJ’s passion for teaching music must have come from a family history of teachers and musicians. His grandparents were school teachers in the Philippines. And as they immigrated to North America, they were sure to bring and share their musical traditions as instrumentalists and dancers. His musical journey started as a student of Suzuki Violin Method for over 13 years at the University of Louisville School of Music Prep School. He also performed with the Louisville Youth Orchestra and other small local ensembles. Beyond the classical foundation, the violin has afforded him an opportunity to express a wider range of styles.  Since arriving in Seattle in 2001, he has been performing in a range of venues from sanctuaries to coffee shops to night clubs. He has been featured in local indie bands, gospel choirs, theater productions and his longstanding Irish party band, Whiskey Mary. His teaching builds from these experiences emphasizing social playing and creative expression through the many dialects that music has to offer whether fiddle, classical or jazz. BJ looks forward to sharing his passion for music and the joy the wonderfully versatile instrument can offer. Tessa Pargiter-Hatem, Operations Director Tessa Pargiter-Hatem first worked with Seattle JazzED as the event coordinator for the annual fundraising gala, and is thrilled to be transitioning into a more prominent operations and events position. As a graduate of the University of Washington, she is eager to be returning to Seattle’s expansive music community and deepening her PNW roots. Tessa brings a diverse skill set to her work at Seattle JazzED, with experience in environmental nonprofits, film, and the food and beverage industry. As an enthusiastic life-long learner, Tessa is motivated to help students and their families express themselves and build community through music education. When she’s not in the office, you’ll find her cycling up mountains or skiing down them, listening to anything from Pink Martini to Fred Again. Liz Riggs Meder, Executive Director Liz is an educator and nonprofit leader with a background in guiding organizations through growth and change to expand their reach and impact. She is passionate about creating access for diverse audiences and has done that for programs ranging from science curriculum for youth to outdoor risk management for adults. Profoundly shaped by her music education experience through her school years, she is eager to return to the music world and to use her change management skills to support making rich music education more accessible to all students. Liz is a long-time Seattle resident and can be found playing in the mountains either skiing down them or slowly running over them. Alyssa Seng, Communications Manager Alyssa Seng is a second-generation Southeast Asian American and a first-generation college graduate. Raised by refugees in a diverse Southern California town, her values and passion for equity and community-building are a product of the unique blend of cultures that surrounded her. She’s excited to leverage her background in communications, having worked on advocacy initiatives ranging from amplifying student voices to leading statewide public health campaigns, to support JazzED’s mission of increasing access to arts education. Raijene Walker, Development Director Raijene Walker brings over a decade of nonprofit leadership and a B.S. in Communication (specializing in Interpersonal and Organizational Communication) to Seattle JazzED.

Angie is an active member on various committees supporting her children's education experiences, particularly around equity, access and inclusion work.  This focus is what drew her to JazzEd years ago when her son participated in one of their summer programs.  She was struck by their commitment to issues of access and equity and genuine desire to serve the BIPOC community not just in statements but in daily practice.  This has continued to be evident as she has been on the board and she is excited to be a part of this journey.

Skip to main content The premier big band of Florida's gulf coast Contact: George McLain (941) 587-3621 Home About Gigs Musicians Gallery Contact About Us “Sarasota Jazz Project” is a high energy 17 piece jazz ensemble comprised of some of the finest musicians on the West Coast of Florida. These talented all-stars play both original compositions and standard tunes, creatively arranged in a unique contemporary Big Band style. Whether you dance, or listen or both, be prepared to be thoroughly entertained. The Sarasota Jazz Project Big Band performs at jazz concerts, clubs, schools/universities, private clubs, and Jazz Club of Sarasota events throughout the year. The Sarasota Jazz Project Big Band is dedicated to the preservation, promotion, and public performance of big band jazz music in Sarasota and the neighboring communities in the State of Florida.  Founded in February 2010 by George McLean and George McLain (no relation!), the band is comprised of the best available local musicians, including professional jazz musicians with long resumes and careers in performing with top-name bands and jazz musicicans throughout the world.  Members also include local music teachers and educators; working musicians who perform regularly in local theaters,orchestras and cabaret venues; and other serious local musicians who maintain \"day jobs\" and play jazz for the sheer pleasure and exhilaration of being a part of this true American art form. While respecting and performing music of great big bands of the past led by such luminaries as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Stan Kenton and Glen Miller, the Sarasota Jazz Project emphasizes the work of modern composers and arrangers such as Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Quincy Jones, and Gil Evans.  Perhaps the most distinctive element of the Sarasota Jazz Project repetoire is its great collection of popular music and standards arranged in new and exciting jazz settings by the very best current musical arrangers in the world, including George Stone, Brad Morey, Gary Urwin, Ed Vizinho, Don Schamber, Gordon Goodwin and John Clayton. Our Goal The specific goal of the Sarasota Jazz Project is to expose the jazz-loving public to these new sounds and musical settings, including original compositions and arrangements written by our own members.  While the Band will perform some of the great treasure of existing literature at the highest level of artistry and taste, including respresetative vocal renditions of classics by Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, and Mel Torme, the emphasis of Sarasota Jazz Project is the preservation and expansion of America's only true native musical art form through innovation in the performance of existing standard works and dedication to locating and presenting the best new works to the public. Jazz, like America itself, prospers through improvisation, innovation, exploration and growth.  The Sarasota Jazz Project is a vibrant part of that improvisation, innovation, exploration and growth.  Audiences can expect to hear a unique and eclectic blend of popular jazz standards, favorites from the \"Great American Song Book\" presented in current new arrangements and styles, as well as modern compositions being heard for the first time.  Whether performing in concert, clubs, cabarets, or country clubs, Sarasota Jazz Project provides music that is both listenable and danceable, both familiar and challenging.  But always expect to hear the spontaneous creativity that is the essence of Jazz! As funding becomes available, we hope to commission original works and compositions for premier performances here in the Sarasota area.  In short, the Sarasota Jazz Project will continue to make a significant contribution toward maintaining Sarasota as the \"Cultural Capitol of Florida.” We have performed and recorded in the following cities: Sarasota Bradenton Tampa Sun City Center Port Charlotte We frequently collaborate with the Jazz Club of Sarasota for concerts and events.  We do private and public parties, so give us a call to jazz up your event today!
