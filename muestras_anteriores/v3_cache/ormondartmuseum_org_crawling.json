Ormond Memorial Art Museum and Gardens Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos United States 0-1 Employees Dedicated to serving the community, Ormond Memorial Art Museum and Gardens (OMAM) is a showcase for paintings, drawings, video, mixed media, photography and three-dimensional works of art. The Museum was founded by Ormond and Ormond Beach residents as a living monument to creative freedom and equality of all persons, and to commemorate the service of World War II veterans who fought valiantly for that ideal. It was the first memorial of its kind in this area, and possibly the State of Florida. In 1946, Malcolm Fraser, an internationally known Canadian painter and winter resident of Orlando, Florida, donated a collection of his primarily religious paintings to the City of Ormond Beach. These fifty-six paintings represent fifty years of creative effort by one artist. Five additional paintings were donated in 1962 by Mr. Fraser's widow. Read more about the Frasers on this website.

Thomas Brown, MD 1948-2024 Dr. Brown was an active member of OMAM's Board of Directors from 2011 to 2024. He served as treasurer from 2012 to 2014, vice president from 2014-2015, and president from 2016 to 2018. Dr. Brown attended Johns Hopkins University, West Virginia University, University of Miami, and the University of South Florida. He was appointed a Diplomat of the American Board of Urology in 1980 and practiced in Daytona Beach from 1978-2014. He led a distinguished career in administrative medicine and Urology.
