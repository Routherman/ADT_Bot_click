Dress Code & Body Hygeine Policy We want every guest to enjoy a comfortable, welcoming experience. To ensure the comfort of all, we ask that guests follow a few simple guidelines regarding attire and personal hygiene: We are a casual dining establishment — jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, and other relaxed attire are perfectly acceptable. We do ask that clothing be clean and presentable (no excessive rips, stains, or offensive graphics). For safety reasons, shirts and shoes are required at all times. To provide a pleasant atmosphere for all guests, we ask that visitors maintain reasonable personal hygiene. Excessive or unpleasant odors — whether from clothing, poor hygiene, or strong fragrances — may disrupt the dining experience for others. Freshly laundered clothing and use of deodorant are strongly encouraged. Please avoid wearing heavy perfumes, colognes, or sprays, as these may affect the comfort of nearby guests. Our goal is to create a welcoming environment for everyone. We ask that all attire and grooming reflect consideration for fellow diners. Guests who do not meet these standards may be respectfully asked to leave or return at another time. This is at the discretion of restaurant management and staff to ensure the comfort of all diners. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in helping us keep Tavern of Tales enjoyable for all.
