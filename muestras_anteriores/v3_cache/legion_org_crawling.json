To enhance the well-being of America's veterans, their families, our military, and our communities by our devotion to mutual helpfulness. The American Legion's vision statement is: \" The American Legion: Veterans Strengthening America. ” The American Legion's value principles are as follows: A VETERAN IS A VETERAN - which means The American Legion embraces all current and former members of the military and endeavors to help them transition into their communities. SELFLESS SERVICE - which means The American Legion celebrates all who contribute to something larger than themselves and inspires others to serve and strengthen America. AMERICAN VALUES AND PATRIOTISM - which means The American Legion advocates for upholding and defending the United States Constitution, equal justice and opportunity for everyone and discrimination against no one, youth education, responsible citizenship and honoring military service by observing and participating in memorial events. FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT - which means The American Legion meets the unique needs of local communities. ADVANCING THE VISION - which means The American Legion educates, mentors and leads new generations of Americans. HONOR THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US - which means The American Legion pays perpetual respect for all past military sacrifices to ensure they are never forgotten by new generations. The American Legion's motto is: \"Veterans Strengthening America.\" Community Service Someone asked \"What does the Fairview Park American Legion Post 738 do?\" Well, we lead with Colors:  At the city's Memorial Day Parade and we conduct the Memorial Day service in the city cemetery. You will see us lead the city's Annual Summer Fest Parade and raise the flag at the opening ceremony. You'll see us with the colors marching down the field and raising the flag prior to the high school's home football games.  We have done this for the past 50 years. We stand Color Guard at the funerals of fallen veterans and have stood honor guard at City Hall, school openings, The Relay for Life Ceremony, and any other events the city has requested. There are things you don't see after going to Brecksville VA Hospital 5 times a year and at Christmas for the past 35 years, handing out large gift packages to an average of 140 patients. With its closing we have been visiting local nursing homes honoring the veteran residents with caps, pins and shirts. Many of them share with us stories of their military experiences. Most touching is the reaction of the elderly female vets who cry because their service is rarely recognized. On a strictly confidential basis, each year we pick a Fairview Park family in need by providing them with cash, food, and, if they have children, gifts. For the past 45 years we have awarded College Scholarships to local students and will continue to do so as long as we are financially able. The foregoing list tells what we do.  It also tells who we are.
