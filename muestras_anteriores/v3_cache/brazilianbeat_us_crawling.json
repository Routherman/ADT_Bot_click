BB is a performing arts group that is hired for events and special occasions. We do not perform at a regular location. Is BB family friendly? Individuals of all ages love the exposure to the Brazilian culture. We have performed for lower school graduation ceremonies and other school activities, including St. Andrew’s school and American Heritage. For what type of events does BB perform? We customize our performances to meet expectations for a wide array of occasions. This includes corporate events, trade shows, fundraisers, weddings, graduation ceremonies, birthday parties, Holiday celebrations, business openings, fashion shows, product launches, etc. Are BB performances limited to Traditional Brazilian culture? Choreographed dance and traditional Brazilian music is our specialty. Additionally, we offer juggling tambourines, Capoeira (Brazilian dance of war), Argentinian tango, salsa, belly dance with fire. What differentiates BB from other Latin dance companies? Brazilian Beat’s wardrobe is out of the ordinary. Our performers showcase costumes weighing in excess of 60 pounds, extending up to 9 feet high. Where does BB source it’s costumes? Our costumes are made in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They are handmade and can take up to six months to complete. Can you provide examples of some creative ideas for children’s parties? For a 12 year old’s birthday party, we provided a samba workshop and encouraged the kids to join the performance. What about Hora Loca? We were voted as “The Best Hora Loca in South Florida” two years running. Can you provide an example of a creative idea for a wedding? For a bride planning a surprise for the groom, we incorporated her into the show. The guests were thrilled and the groom was mystified. Are the extravagant costumes only used with samba? Not necessarily. At Miami Art Basel, a greeter in extravagant costume, welcomed the guests to techno music. Guests stood in line to get pictures. How can we promote our company’s brand with Brazilian Beat? Our extravagant costumes are a great attention grabber, we recommend that you display your company’s logo at the photo set to boost your social media. What They Say This was one of my most favorite moments of the entire wedding! I felt so much joy the entire time I was dancing and had a BLAST! Brazilian Beat is amazing and I feel so grateful to be able to have performed with them. Suzanne's professionalism , kindness , attention to detail, and sheer passion for her art is inspiring. The dancers were so talented, beautiful, fun , and encouraging ... I loved dancing along side them. The drummers were so skilled and created the best beats . I was dancing in the kitchen the entire time I was in hiding because their beats were that good! Overall Brazilian Beat brought the heat, and many great vibes to our wedding and for that I am forever thankful! Alexandra A. Wow!  I saw this dance entertainment company at the Little Brazil restaurant,  Boca Raton. 100% recommend the show!!  It was FUN; beautiful to watch the dancers, drummers and also dance with them.  We learned about the culture and took pictures with them.  If you're visiting or even living here, this is a MUST to experience 🙂 Claudia H. What a stunning addition to any event! The extravagant costumes and performances are definetely the highlight of any occasion.\r\nSuzanne Thorson has a sharp vision for art, marketing and entertainment and a great sense for adapting the performance for any event, from royalty, which she has done worldwide, to any sized corporation's event or trade shows. Caroline Z. I started working with Suzanne at the beginning of the year for my December 2019 wedding. We met initially at her studio where she explained every detail, showed me costumes, answered all my questions, etc. She also met with me at my wedding venue months in advance so that she would know exactly where she and her entertainer's park, arrive, their entrance as well as the main reception/performance area. So professional! Marsha G. - https://www.yelp.com/biz/brazilian-beat-boca-raton?osq=brazilian+beat Amazing experience!!!! 100%% recommend! From\r\nbeginning to end! Suzanne the owner is involved in every detail, so take her advise because she knows what she's doing! Everyone at the wedding couldn't stop talking about it or dancing it was like we were in Rio Carnaval! I am Brazilian so I can tell you it's 100% legit! Would hire 1000 times more! Thank you all the dancers and musicians and Suzanne for a espectacular performance! By the way the performers looked in great shape and not old and chubby like a lot of them do! . Catherina S. - https://www.yelp.com/biz/brazilian-beat-boca-raton?osq=brazilian+beat Great Company. We hired them for several events. The team always on point. Suzanne the owner always willing to help and do the extra mile.\r\nAnd not forgetting to say. The ROI is great. The exposure and the energy that brings to the attendees is phenomenal.\r\nWe did from small events to big conferences. All successfully accomplished. They still talking about us and the Samba Dancers after years.\r\nDefinitely recommended!

READ MORE: Pope Leo XIV completes formalities to become bishop of Rome, declaring ‘I am Roman!’ Sisters Marizele Cassiano and Marisa de Paula, members of the “Copiosa Redenção” congregation, were talking about a vocational retreat on Brazil’s Pai Eterno — Eternal Father — TV channel when they brought up a song about being called to the religious life. The duo stood up and launched into a routine complete with singing, beatbox and dance moves. Then the presenter, Deacon Giovani Bastos, joined in, matching Sister de Paula’s moves in a performance that’s now been seen by millions on social media in Brazil and abroad. “Beatboxing, dancing, and the songs itself, are tools that God uses to reach the hearts of the people we work with. And it works! It’s beautiful to see,” said Sister Marizele Cassiano. “That moment was very spontaneous, because with Sister Marisa, if you start a beat, she will dance. And I’m used to singing, to beatboxing, so for us it was very simple, spontaneous and at the same time very surprising to see that it went viral even outside Brazil,” Sister Marizele Cassiano, beatboxing nun, told The Associated Press.The Sisters are dedicated to young people who are struggling with drug addiction. They say music has been a powerful tool to help those in need. “Beatboxing, dancing, and the songs itself, are tools that God uses to reach the hearts of the people we work with. And it works! It’s beautiful to see,” said Sister Marizele Cassiano. While Sister Marisa has no Instagram account, Sister Marizele has surpassed 100,000 followers since her beatboxing went viral. The sisters also work as vocation promoters, organizing retreats for women interested in pursuing a religious career. We're not going anywhere.
