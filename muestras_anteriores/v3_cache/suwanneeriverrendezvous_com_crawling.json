Scout Reviewed Feb. 27, 2023 Second Time This was our second visit in about 6 years- I know but gap but we still love it. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the grounds are kept clean, the bathrooms are nice. We did the primitive camping no power no electric, but they have spaces with it and RV sites, the primitive sections just have more privacy than those. My sites didn’t have great level spots for a tent but it was right next to the spring and close to the river for fishing which is why we came. Hubs caught a catfish on his birthday- it was a great time. They have a heated pool and are expanding. Site p14 and p15 Month of Visit February Share Report Aspen H.

If you like activities there are plenty. Anything from kayaking and bike riding to pigeon races and fishing. A lot of the tent sites are along the Suwannee River. Great views! My only complaint is it can use some updating. But they are trying!￼￼ Site 3 Month of Visit January Share Report Richard B. Guide Reviewed Mar. 21, 2021 Great family park. Clean individual bathrooms. Pool area is nice. High water has the spring covered up so can't comment on that. Playground for the kids. Wifi all over the park. Booked a second stay while on the property. Share Report Chelsea C. Traveler Reviewed Dec. 21, 2020 Quirky and active riverside RV community SRRR is a 40 acre park with country-clever DIY vibes and unusual artifacts including a handmade automated bowling alley in an abandoned chicken coop with mechanical levers that return balls and reset pins, weekly events ranging from chicken shit bingo to pigeon racing, a dog park, and a cozy spring-side divey lodge-like restaurant. Despite its name, convict spring is a beautiful clear fresh water spring, best appreciated in winter when no kids are kicking up dirt in it. I have tent-camped in a lovely prim spot beside the river and also RV camped with my Skoolie here. I adore the beauty of the location, spring-side on the broad Suwannee River, but had to subtract one star for the horrendously bad and unwelcoming (verging on foreboding) service at the cafe, and disappointment that the hot tub was closed both times we visited. Will def return to this spot. (5) View All Share Report T Tina S. Guide Reviewed Aug. 2, 2020 Fun campground We stayed at site 105 (full hook-up, $45 per night) and it was perfect 👌  Neighbors only on one side, close to pool and a short walk to Convict Spring. Catch & release pond for fishing is also super close. Friday night bingo and Saturday has pigeon races, chicken poo 💩  bingo and trivia/karaoke.   You can rent kayaks or canoes to take up the Suwannee River. Very dog 🐕  friendly; our Goldens loved swimming in Convict Springs. We will definitely be back!! Share Report Rosina E. Guide Reviewed Jul. 19, 2020 Meh So this is the redneck riviera and there are tons of kids, Trump and confederate flags, and flies, plus the twice a day cow paddy smell. The roads are narrow and water diveted going down to the river, the springs smells like tadpoles, and the kayak launch was a diveted dirt road that looks real sad. For this price in the middle of nowhere, the WiFi sucks and the water pressure is often like 5 psi. We didn’t use any facilities but absolutely NO ONE was social distancing in the office, pool or really anywhere. Won’t be back. Share Report E Emily A. Guide Reviewed Apr. 25, 2020 Wish I could give this place 10 stars Just visited for our first time this week. It is absolutely our favorite campground of all now. The lower section has dispersed tent camping right on the river underneath beautiful big oak trees. Couldn’t even imagine a better campsite! They’ll take you pretty much anywhere you want on the river so you can kayak or canoe and visit the variety of natural springs in the area. Our second night ended up being pretty scary with tornado warnings but the staff came down to get us and opened up the lodge after hours for us to shelter in during the storm. Honestly I couldn’t imagine a better campground. Share Report Gary M. Scout Reviewed Apr. 21, 2020 Expensive but nice Upper is spacious, bath house has no air conditioning which is BAD in summer. Folks are real friendly and staff is great. Share Report R Rick & Rene Scout Reviewed Sep. 18, 2019 Unique This is my husband and my second stay here.  The town of Mayo is a  small quite town so it is advisable to have your provisions, as it is approximately 45 minutes to most shopping.  The upper level sites are spacious and clean with the lower level more rustic. We love the restaurant, the spring, the entertainment, and the unique.....to say the least, weekend games/activities. EVERYTHING  is dog friendly.  That is a big plus for us as our westie dog Mojo goes everywhere with us. We come here to \"get away from it all\" and chillax. Share Report Gabriel M. Scout Reviewed May. 10, 2018 Suwanee River RIGHT ON!!! This is a really family friendly campground. We try and go 4-5 times a year and each time NEVER disappoints. It not only sits on Convict Springs, but on the Suwanee River as well. In addition to having chicken poop bingo and pigeon races (yes, those are real things!

No Comments filed under: River Lore Backing a camper into a back-in site at Suwannee River Rendezvous Posted July 20, 2024 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Backing a camper into a back-in site at Suwannee River Rendezvous can be an intimidating experience for many campers, especially those new to RVing. However, with a few tips and some practice, it can become a manageable task. First, before arriving at the campground, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the layout of the site. Knowing the position of hookups, trees, and potential obstacles can make the backing-in process much smoother. Upon arrival, take a few minutes to survey the site and plan your approach. When it comes time to back in, having a spotter outside the vehicle can be incredibly helpful. Clear and concise hand signals can aid in guiding the driver, ensuring that the camper is positioned accurately. Communication between the driver and the spotter is key, so establishing a set of signals or using walkie-talkies can help streamline the process. Remember to take it slow. Maneuvering a camper into a tight spot requires patience and precision. Utilize your mirrors and take small, deliberate movements to avoid oversteering. If necessary, don’t hesitate to pull forward and readjust your angle before continuing. It’s also crucial to remain mindful of your surroundings. Keep an eye on potential hazards around your campsite and be aware of neighboring campers and their vehicles. Being respectful of others’ space and property is a fundamental aspect of the camping community. Finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help if needed. Many campgrounds, including Suwannee River Rendezvous, have friendly staff and fellow campers who are more than willing to offer guidance and assistance. Embracing the camaraderie of the camping experience can turn what may seem like a daunting task into a bonding opportunity with fellow enthusiasts. In conclusion, backing a camper into a back-in site at Suwannee River Rendezvous may pose a challenge, but with preparation, clear communication, and a patient approach, it can be a rewarding and successful endeavor.

(13) View All Share Report Jenn B. Legend Reviewed Oct. 10, 2020 Disappointed We wanted to love this campground but couldn’t.  We got TONS of recommendations to visit this resort based on the fact they had plenty of things for kids.\nWe stayed in site 31 and were so turned off that we ended our trip early and went home the next day.\nThere is little vegetation between the sites and barely enough room for the tent.  It was a very small site, most/all of them were.  It is a noisy park and where we stayed our campsite was pretty much a parking lot in the evening due to the traffic from the office and restaurant and a high traffic zone during the day because of the kayak launch.  Trying to put a baby down is hard when there are constant cars, headlights, and golf carts right in your site.\nAt night there are tons of cats that will invade your site (while we were out sitting) so don’t leave food out.\nIn the morning we woke up to a pig (must have been a pet) wandering in our site!!  It defecated in our site and that’s when we pretty much had enough. I’m sure some really love it but we didn’t.  We probably could have asked to move sites, but the thought of packing everything up to unpack it again was too much.  We will not be back.\n*usually I take tons of videos and photos for my reviews.  I didn’t do that this time if that tells you something! Read More Share Report Ashlee R. Guide Reviewed Sep. 27, 2020 Clean, quiet spot So let’s start with the sites. Intermingled rv, cabin, and primitive sites close enough to see the water. We RV camped while my mom and aunt set up tent in P3 ON the water. It was the best view and we sat out there both nights at their fire ring. There are lots of things to do if you want to hang with other campers like\nChicken Poo Bingo? (We passed on that one lol) We did use the pool though and that area was so great. Corn hole, picnic tables with a huge fan, horseshoes, and more with two great pools and a jacuzzi open until 10pm. The store and staff were great and the bathrooms/showers clean and well kept! With close proximity to several springs, we’ll definitely return. (7) View All Share Report Thais G. Scout Reviewed Oct. 17, 2019 Amazing place and amazing people! Clean, organized, and very reserved. I stayed on the furthest tent site. It is accessible with you car. They have their own beautiful spring, and the camping site is right at the river. It even has a rope to swing from the river bank into the water. We could hear the large fishes jumping out of the water and managed to see a few. They offer a service of Dropping you off up the river with a canoe, so that you don't have to paddle too hard to go back to camp. If you can, stop along the little entrances and find amazing little springs along the way. The owners are always in the main cabin, and always happy to help you out. I haven't been there in more than a year, but cannot wait to go again!

Our smallest RV site is 40 by 80 feet, so we can accommodate RVs of all shapes and sizes. Visitors are welcome to park either on the original campground, or at the new Rendezvous resort, where guests can wake up to our beautiful pool complex and spa. But as every RV owner knows, it’s important to protect your vehicle against unwanted intruders when you’re on the road. Today we’ll look at a few security tips to help you get started. Upgrade Your Locks An RV is more than just a mode of transportation; it’s also your home away from home. With this in mind, consider upgrading your RV’s standard locks with high-quality padlocks or cylinder locks that can’t be easily broken. It’s generally a good idea to add locks to your hitch and steering wheel, as well. That way, you can enjoy your trip without having to worry about whether or not your belongings are safe. Invest in Security Lights Motion-activated security lights are great theft deterrents at night. You may even use similar lights to protect your house when you’re not on the road. Modern LED security lights are inexpensive, energy efficient and easy to install. They’re also bright enough to scare off anyone who might think about trying to break into your RV under cover of darkness. Park Smarter With an RV, you should back into campsites to make it easy to get out, right? Well, not necessarily. Pulling forward into campsites can make it much harder for thieves to make a quick getaway with your vehicle. It may add a few minutes to your exit, but your RV’s security is worth it. Next time you’re traveling in Florida, be sure to visit us on the Suwannee River!

They can smell the carbon dioxide in human breath from over 100 feet away, so it’s no wonder they flock to campsites this time of year. However, there’s no need to let these pesky creatures ruin your outdoor fun with itchy bites. Here are a few clever ways to deter mosquitoes during your next camping trip. Burn sage. Mosquitoes hate the smell of sage, so if you add some to your campfire they’ll stay away. As an added bonus, ticks dislike it too! The sage smell will linger on your skin and clothing after the fire burns out, giving you extended protection. Pack dryer sheets. Even if you’re not planning on doing any laundry, pack some dryer sheets on your next camping trip. Mosquitoes and bees will avoid them, so place them under tablecloths, near food and in your pockets. Sprinkle some mouthwash. Mint is another smell that mosquitoes hate. After using some mint-flavored mouthwash, sprinkle it around your campsite to keep them away. Light a candle. Not only do citronella candles add ambiance to your campsite; they also keep mosquitoes at bay! Best of all, a single candle can offer hours of protection against mosquitoes. Rub yourself with citrus peel. Mosquitoes aren’t very fond of citrus oils, either. After you peel an orange or lemon, rub your skin with the peel to deter mosquitoes. This only works with fresh peel, so do it right away. Now that you know how to keep your campsite mosquito-free, it’s time to book your next adventure! We’d love to have you come visit us at the Suwannee River Rendezvous campground and RV resort this summer. Just give us a call at (386) 294-2510 or contact us online today to learn more! filed under: Camping Tags: Citronella , Citrus Oils , Mosquito Bites , Sage « Stay Safe on the Trail With These Hiking Tips How to Stay Cool During a Summer Camping Trip » © 2025 Suwannee River Rendezvous | Sitemap | Privacy Policy | Required Full Name What is your full name?

Hurricane HELENE changed our plans and the destruction was pretty intense around Perry & Mayo FL. This campground is really nice with pool & community center, newer office/store/restaurant building. We did a one nighter so we only used electricity and didn’t unhitch. The CG did not suffer as much damage as other locations particularly in Perry; no campers turned over, just tree debris. Utilities were functioning again and were stable.

Pretty easy, pull in, park, unhook toad and proceed to campsite.  Set up and then go to office for check in. The staff were amazingly friendly and beyond helpful. They provided information on the park, river conditions and local attractions and towns. The park facilities were clean, although the entrance road was dusty and had a lot of potholes. Signs were posted to try to slow traffics to reduce dust until the paving project starts. 160 new sites being created with new pool and hot tub.

The “lower” section is nearest to the river and mainly tent or smaller camper sites. The “upper” section is standard full hookup sites, mix of pull through and back in. We had a shade shelter (extra $) which was nice. The sites were laid out well, some larger than others but overall no different than most RV parks. We do not have a pet but we saw they have a very large dog park including a small agility course. The heated pool was amazing, and that area along with the hot tub and smaller unheated “conversation” pool definitely has more of a resort feel. The Laundry area was fine, though busy and could probably be bigger for the size of the park. The activities here arewhat sets it apart: Bingo, trivia, karaoke, show me the money, newlywed game, exercise classes, redneck bowling, kick ball pool and as others have noted the pigeon races and chicken poo bingo are a hoot! If you are lucky you might see Charlie Girl-the owners potbelly pig who often rooms freely! The staff was friendly and helpful. When you arrive at this park you just go directly to your site and then go check in with the office after you hook up and settle in. That was a great feature though the signage or instructions were not exactly clear - luckily another camper saw us pull in and gave us some direction. Quite a few seasonal residents and all were warm and welcoming. We have already booked another stay for a few weeks in the fall! Regarding the dust mentioned by another reviewer. Yes it is noticeable for those right against the dirt road. We were one row over and while we noticed with the windows open things got dusty it did not bother us on a day-to-day.

Despite a bunch of signs saying 10 MPH people fly up and down the road. Well after 8 nights my fifth wheel was really covered with dust as well as my truck. For your info - sites 106 thru 117 are all along the dirt road. Next the owner needed to trim the trees at the sites, A branch actually punctured my roof material along the edge while backing in. He came by two days later and trimmed a bunch of trees, that didn't help me much then. All that aside, the facilities were nice (laundry, pool, propane fill, office, etc.) The sites had picnic table, fire ring, and some had a roof over the picnic table. The sites are a combo of sand and stone. So we kept dragging sand inside but that's not unusual. The office is not where the large campground is, it's actually down in the woods by the river so you'll to go down there for anything. The river was high so the spring, Convict Spring, was flooded out with brown water but there are other springs in the area that don't flood and are much larger. The cell service was weird, one minute it would be none or one bar then five minutes later it would be 3 or 4 bars. (Verizon and AT&T both).

The campground was filled with a combination of Snowbirds and Families.  It was nice to see the youngsters free to ride their bikes up and down the paved roads.  Everyone was very friendly,  Lot's of big rigs and lot's of smaller rigs.  Seems like everyone is welcome.  The river was flooded so we couldn't tube or canoe but had a very nice time just enjoying the sun and the quietness of it all.  Lot's along the road were a little dusty but all lot's are roomy.  At this time of year, sites are either runny or shady depending on the site.  Pool was busy and covered patio was a great place to have large group gatherings.  In the evening you could see groups of people sitting around the fire sharing life.  We will definitely be back.

While we were here the River crested and what an experience it was to watch the River rise over a weeks time. I work remotely so I do believe this is an important note for those of you who do the same. The cell service for ATT was absolutely spotty at best for phone calls and barely adequate for working even with a booster. However, I did go to the lodge every day and the internet provided in there was more than adequate to do large file transfers. Overall this place is frozen in time. Pigeon races on saturdays, community events and summer camp every day. It’s not the Ritz Carlton of RV parks or resorts but that exactly what makes it special.

Ours had a fire ring, picnic table, and wood bench seat.  You MUST use 50 amp service, so ensure you have a dogbone if you're rig is 30amp. We didn't use the shower facilities, but the pool restrooms were well maintained and clean. Our only gripe of the facility and the reason for only 4 stars is that smoking is allowed in the pool area. There were a few instances of smoking on the pool deck which was aggravating and disappointing but we would definitely visit the campground again.

Family members of all ages can find something fun to do in the great outdoors during your upcoming week or weekend camping trip.

Adults and children alike can enjoy the thrill of fishing together. Veteran fishers are able to spend the day luring in native fish while smaller children can fish on and off throughout a hot summer day. Caught fish can also be used to make a fresh dinner over the open fire. Hiking and Adventure If you and your friends or family prefers a more active way to spend a day of camping, there is plenty to see on a hike. Pack a bag with snacks, water and sunscreen before you head out.

No Comments filed under: Camping , Camping Meals , River Lore , Suwannee RV Resort Hiking Boots are a Camping Necessity Posted March 10, 2023 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Picking out new hiking boots can be a challenge because you want to make sure you get the right fit and look, while making sure they’re good quality. There are different hiking boots for different terrains, so it’s important to know what kind of trails you’ll be exploring. Hiking boots are also essential gear for going camping and exploring the outdoors. They give you support and durability to withstand harsh terrains. Exploring\nLight Trails You’ll be able to wear an ankle-high hiking boot or shoe when the trail is well maintained.  You’ll want to make sure the hiking shoe has a good support and durable sole. Many of these types of shoes are not waterproof, so you’ll need to keep that in mind. The Danner Trail 2650 and the Women’s Trail 2650 are perfect for long miles on light terrains and easier trails. Tougher\nTrails If you’re serious about exploring the wilderness and want a book that you can put a good amount of miles on, the Danner Skyridge and the Women’s Danner X Timbers Jag are your best options. Both of these are 100% waterproof and are meant for a variety of terrains. You can wear these everyday out walking or on some long hiking trails. For a\nMountaineer The mountains and rougher trails call for a more durable and rugged boot that can do some lifting in rough conditions. The Mountain 600 and the Women’s Mountain 600 are the best all-around hiking boots from Danner. These have awesome grip for any type of surface ensuring a successful hike up in the mountains or on a windy trail in the woods.

No Comments filed under: Camping , Hiking , River Lore , Suwannee RV Resort How to Manage Camping with Dogs Posted February 15, 2023 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Taking your dog camping with you can be a lot of fun, both for you and for your pet. But before you decide to bring your four-legged friend along for the ride, there are a few steps you should take to ensure that everyone has a great time. Check out our suggestions below! Find a Campsite That is Pet-Friendly. First thing’s first! Before you book a camping trip , you need to make sure the campsite you’re going to visit allows dogs. After all, you don’t want to arrive at your destination only to find out that it isn’t pet-friendly. At Suwannee River Rendezvous , we’re happy to welcome dogs to our campsites as long as they aren’t noisy or aggressive. Just be sure to clean up after them! Take Your Dog to the Vet First Make sure your dog’s flea and tick medications are up to date before you take them camping. If it’s been awhile since your last trip to the vet, it’s a good idea to schedule a visit prior to your camping adventure. This way, you can rest easy knowing your dog is healthy and ready for the journey ahead. Pack a First Aid Kit for Your Dog In the event that your dog is injured while camping, it’s important to have a first aid kit handy. There are many helpful tools in first aid kits for humans, but certain items like veterinary bandages can only be found in first aid kits made specifically for pets. Bring a Tether and Stake. Even if you don’t always tie your dog up at home, camping can be a much different experience. Your dog might get spooked by animals in the woods, or unexpectedly run off and get lost. With a tether and stake, you can give your dog some room to roam at your campsite without having to worry about them getting lost. If you’re looking for a pet-friendly campsite in Florida, look no further than Suwannee River Rendezvous. We would love to host you, your family and your pup on your next camping trip .

Most modern RVs are well equipped to handle cold temperatures, but it’s still a good idea to take some extra precautions before you embark on a winter camping trip. Check out a few of our favorite tips for traveling in an RV this winter below! Check Seals Around Windows and Doors Before you leave, inspect all the windows, doors, storage compartments and access panels on your RV to make sure they are properly sealed with weather stripping and caulk. An RV can be a cozy shelter during winter camping trips, but only if it’s properly protected against the elements. The last thing you want is to spend your whole trip searching for the source of a draft that could have been sealed before you left. Pack Emergency Supplies In addition to packing your usual emergency supplies like a first aid kit and weather radio , it’s a good idea to bring some additional cold-weather accessories as well. These include extra blankets and warm clothes, sleeping bags rated for sub-freezing temperatures and tire chains for your RV in case you get surprised by a snowstorm.

It’s important to remember, though, that campfires can become dangerous if you’re not careful. In the spirit of Smokey , today we’ll share a few important campfire safety tips to keep in mind on your next camping trip. Pick the right place for your campfire. Campfire safety should really start before you ever strike a match. Prior to building your campfire, look around to make sure there aren’t any low-hanging branches or brush nearby that might ignite from a stray spark. If you’re staying at a campground or state park, you should always use established fire pits whenever possible rather than trying to build one of your own. Keep water and a shovel handy. You never know when a strong gust of wind might blow and turn your little campfire into a roaring blaze. With this in mind, you should always keep a bucket of water and shovel nearby in case you need to smother the fire in a hurry. You can even wet the area around your campfire to prevent sparks from catching in the grass. Avoid leaving the campfire unattended. From the moment you start a campfire, you should keep an eye on it at all times. If you have to leave your campfire for a few minutes, make sure there’s someone else nearby to tend to it while you’re gone. Before you go to bed, smother the fire with ash and water and spread out any remaining embers to prevent them from reigniting. If you’ve been missing the warm glow of a campfire this winter, we’d love to have you come visit us at our campground in sunny Florida.

The good news is, making coffee when you’re camping is easier than you might think. Check out these four clever ways to make coffee at your campsite: Cowboy Coffee All you need for this classic method of campsite coffee brewing is a kettle and a campfire. To make cowboy coffee, boil water in a kettle, then remove it from the heat source and let it cool enough to stop boiling (about 30 seconds). Then, stir in two tablespoons of coffee grounds per serving. Let it rest for two minutes, then stir again and let it rest for two more minutes. Once the grounds settle to the bottom, pour the coffee as slowly as possible into a mug to minimize grit. MacGyver Coffee If you really don’t like drinking your coffee unfiltered, you can make coffee at your campsite using a thermos, a fastener such as a rubber band and a mesh coffee filter or cotton cheesecloth. You can find detailed instructions for this method here . Coffee Bags You can either buy coffee bags (essentially tea bags for coffee) or make one yourself with a coffee filter and twine. All you need to do is throw it in a cup of hot water to brew your coffee. French Press No need to bring your French press from home—these days you can find French press coffeemakers designed specifically for camping . There’s no better place to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee than the Suwannee River Rendezvous campground and RV resort. With plenty of hiking, swimming and entertainment options to enjoy, you’re sure to having a relaxing, refreshing time when you stay with us. To book your next trip, just give us a call or contact us online today!

If so, you should consider replacing it with a new tent that will get you excited about camping again. Today’s tents are lighter, more durable and easier to set up than ever. Check out a few tips for finding a tent that’s right for you below! Look for a tent that’s large enough to meet your needs. Are you looking for a tent that’s just large enough for you, or will your entire family be sleeping inside the tent with you? Tent manufacturers tend to be pretty conservative in their capacity estimates, so it’s typically best to err on the side of caution and choose a tent that’s slightly larger than what you think you need. This is especially true for tall people. If it’s just going to be you and one other person in the tent, for example, consider shopping for a three-person tent to make sure you have enough room for you and all your gear. Consider the materials and construction. A tent’s construction will affect its waterproofing and its ability to protect you in extreme weather conditions. In general, it’s a good idea to look for a tent that has a combination of double stitching and folded seems. A tent with these two features will be far less prone to tearing and leaking during rainstorms. You should also pay close attention to the seasons that the tent is rated for. Three-season tents—which are designed for use in the spring, summer and fall—are probably the most popular and cost-effective option for most campers. Four-season tents are ideal for camping in cold climates, but they are heavier and more expensive than what most weekend campers need, especially here in Florida . Make sure the zippers are built to last. During a camping trip, you’ll probably be moving in and out of your tent quite a bit. With this in mind, you should look for a tent that has rugged, heavy-duty zippers that won’t break after just a few camping trips. There’s nothing worse than trying to fix a broken tent zipper in the middle of a camping trip. Ready to put your new tent to good use? We’d love to have you join us here on the beautiful Suwannee River! Just give us a call or contact us online to reserve your campsite today! No Comments filed under: Camping Tags: Camping Gear , Camping in Florida , Tents Meal Prep Tips for Your Next Camping Trip Posted October 1, 2018 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Getting ready to pack up the car for your next camping trip? If you haven’t been on a camping trip in a while, you may be concerned about the logistics of cooking meals at a campsite. The good news is, there are a few simple steps you can take to make cooking much easier while camping. Check out a few of our favorite meal prep tips below! Come up with a full list of meals you’re going to cook while camping. Regardless of whether you’re going camping for one night or an entire week, it’s a good idea to sit down and make a list of what you’re going to eat for each and every meal. This way, you’ll know exactly what ingredients you’ll need to pack before you head to the grocery store. Cook what you can ahead of time. Cooking at a campsite tends to be a little more challenging than cooking at home. Therefore, you should cook whatever you can at home before you leave. The idea of sitting around a campfire cooking chicken might sound appealing, but in reality, it can be a slow and tedious process. Consider cooking things like chicken at home and then reheating them when you’re ready to eat. You can also cut up vegetables, fruits and more at home so that they’ll be ready to cook when you arrive at your campsite. Try not to rely on your campfire to make every meal. There may be times when you’re camping that you just don’t feel like cooking. You want to throw something together that’s quick and easy, like a sandwich. Bring along meals that are simple to make for when you don’t feel like getting a fire going. You’ll be glad you did when you’re exhausted after a day full of hiking, fishing and exploring the great outdoors. At Suwannee River Rendezvous, you can find both primitive tent camping sites and full hook-up sites for RVs.

You want to keep yourself clean and healthy, but it can be tough when you have limited access to water and bathroom supplies Today we’ll look at a few helpful hygiene tips to keep in mind during your next camping adventure. Pack the right supplies. You may not be able to pack up your entire bathroom and bring it with you, but you can bring a few essential personal hygiene supplies that will keep you clean in a pinch. Make sure you have hand sanitizer, biodegradable soap, a toothbrush and toothpaste, unscented baby wipes and toilet paper before you leave home. Steer clear of bringing deodorant (it could attract animals to your campsite), scented soaps and shampoos, razors and anything else that could harm the ecosystem around your campsite. Find a way to bathe. There are several ways you can bathe yourself while camping. You can jump into a lake or river to wash dirt and oil away from your skin (just don’t use soap in the water as it could contaminate it). You can also take what’s called a trail shower by using biodegradable soap, a washcloth and a few liters of water (just don’t take one too close to a natural water source as, again, it could contaminate the water). Or, you can simply give yourself a sponge bath with biodegradable soap, water and a towel. Regardless of which option you pick, it’s important to wash yourself in some form or fashion. Bring water to launder your clothing. You won’t be able to do large loads of laundry at your campsite, but you can wash things like underwear and other clothing staples with a little water and biodegradable soap. This will keep you smelling fresh and minimize the amount of extra clothing you need to bring on your trip. If tent camping isn’t your speed, you can find a variety of comfortable lodging options at our resort and campground as well! These accommodations come equipped with all the comforts of home like HVAC systems, WiFi access, cable TV and more. To schedule your reservation, feel free to give us a call or contact us online today! No Comments filed under: River Lore Tags: Bathing , Biodegradable Soap , Camp Hygiene These Kid-Friendly Crafts are Perfect for Your Next Camping Trip Posted July 2, 2018 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Camping can be a lot of fun for kids of all ages, but it’s always a good idea to have some crafts and activities on hand to prevent young children from getting bored during a weekend camping trip. Check out a few fun and easy craft ideas to try on your next camping trip below! Camping Bingo Bingo is a classic game that the whole family can enjoy. To make it even more fun, you can play camping bingo and incorporate all the sights and sounds of camping into the mix. This is a great activity to help pass the time during a passing summer thunderstorm. Toilet Paper Roll Binoculars Your kids will have the opportunity see all kinds of amazing things when they go camping. You can encourage them to look around and make the most of the experience by equipping them with a pair of homemade binoculars! Make a simple pair by binding two toilet paper rolls together with twine and decorating them with stickers and illustrations. They’ll love looking for birds and other wildlife with their personalized binoculars. Camping Scavenger Hunts If you really want to keep your kids occupied, you can send them out on a camping scavenger hunt. Ask them to spot things like flowers, birds, insects and ferns. Chances are, they won’t have to travel far to find all sorts of plants and animals around your campsite. At Suwannee River Rendezvous, we offer a variety of kid-friendly activities that are fun for the whole family. You can take a swim in our beautiful pool complex , or sing your favorite songs at karaoke night in the Lodge . Give us a call to learn more, or book your reservation online today! No Comments filed under: Camping Tags: Camping With Kids , Crafts and Activities , Scavenger Hunts Handy Travel Accessories to Keep in Your RV Posted April 24, 2018 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort One of the best parts about traveling in an RV is that you can bring all the comforts of home along with you when you hit the road. From basics like cooking utensils and organizers to luxuries like TVs and camping hammocks, you can equip your RV with all sorts of useful accessories. But while most of this gear is optional, there are a few travel accessories you should definitely keep on board during your next adventure. Check them out below! First Aid Kit When you’re far from home in unfamiliar territory, it’s always a good idea to keep a first aid kit on hand. This way, you can treat everything from minor cuts and bruises to headaches and sunburns. It’s especially important to have a complete first aid kit if you’re traveling in remote areas where hospitals and urgent care centers might not be easy to find. Solar Charger In the event that you lose power in your RV, a solar charger can allow you to keep phones and other devices charged so you can contact roadside assistance for help. These chargers have gotten far more affordable in recent years, and they can offer some valuable peace of mind when you’re on the road. Weather Radio The weather can change quickly when you’re on the road, and a weather radio can help you stay one step ahead of dangerous storms. These radios offer access to a nationwide network of NOAA weather stations that provide regular updates on developing weather patterns throughout the country. You can also find hand-cranked weather radios that operate reliably even if you don’t have access to batteries. Next time you’re on the road, we’d love to see you at our beautiful RV resort on the Suwannee River! Give us a call to learn more about our accommodations, or reserve your campground online today.

Paddling down the river is a uniquely relaxing experience that we look forward to every year. It also offers a great opportunity to get an up-close look at the local wildlife in our area. But to make sure you have a good time, it’s important to keep a few important safety tips in mind when you’re out on the water. Don’t Drink and Paddle Stowing a few beers in your canoe might seem like a nice idea, but trust us: alcohol and boating don’t mix. Inebriation will make it much harder to react quickly if you get into a dangerous situation on the water.  In fact, alcohol is the number one contributing factor in recreational boating deaths. Rather than drinking while you paddle, wait till you get back to shore to enjoy a well-earned beer and a hot meal. Always Wear Your Personal Flotation Device Keep your life jacket on at all times, even if you’re a strong swimmer. Not only will it keep you afloat in strong currents, it will also make you more visible to your fellow canoers and kayakers. This way, if your boat tips over, you can get back in sooner rather than later. Dress for the Weather Wet clothing can cause you to lose body heat at a rapid pace, making it possible to get hypothermia even in relatively warm weather. In general you should wear light, water-resistant layers, and avoid cotton garments whenever possible. Bring a Buddy It’s always best to paddle with at least one other person, especially if you don’t have a lot of boating experience. The more people you travel with, the easier it will be to spot potential hazards and help each other out in the event of an emergency. Ready to get outside and paddle down the beautiful waters of the Suwannee River ? We’d love to see you at our resort and campground conveniently located in Mayo, Florida.

No Comments filed under: Water Activities Tags: Boating Safety , Canoes , Kayaks , Life Jackets RV Security Tips for Your Next Big Adventure Posted March 27, 2018 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort At the Suwannee River Rendezvous, we welcome RV travelers from all over the country. Our smallest RV site is 40 by 80 feet, so we can accommodate RVs of all shapes and sizes. Visitors are welcome to park either on the original campground, or at the new Rendezvous resort, where guests can wake up to our beautiful pool complex and spa. But as every RV owner knows, it’s important to protect your vehicle against unwanted intruders when you’re on the road. Today we’ll look at a few security tips to help you get started. Upgrade Your Locks An RV is more than just a mode of transportation; it’s also your home away from home. With this in mind, consider upgrading your RV’s standard locks with high-quality padlocks or cylinder locks that can’t be easily broken. It’s generally a good idea to add locks to your hitch and steering wheel, as well. That way, you can enjoy your trip without having to worry about whether or not your belongings are safe. Invest in Security Lights Motion-activated security lights are great theft deterrents at night. You may even use similar lights to protect your house when you’re not on the road. Modern LED security lights are inexpensive, energy efficient and easy to install. They’re also bright enough to scare off anyone who might think about trying to break into your RV under cover of darkness. Park Smarter With an RV, you should back into campsites to make it easy to get out, right? Well, not necessarily. Pulling forward into campsites can make it much harder for thieves to make a quick getaway with your vehicle. It may add a few minutes to your exit, but your RV’s security is worth it. Next time you’re traveling in Florida, be sure to visit us on the Suwannee River! Reserve your site online , or give us a call today to learn more.

From gas and food to highway tolls, there are many expenses that will crop up along your adventure. Fortunately, with a little preparation, you can have a wonderful trip without breaking your budget. Consider your destination. Where are you going on your next RV trip? Your options are virtually limitless, but some destinations will be more expensive than others. If you’re on a tight budget, consider making a list of potential destinations and then narrowing it down based on their fees and expenses. At Suwannee River Rendezvous, you can find affordable RV camping rates all year ‘round. Shop around for the best gas prices. In 2018, it’s easier than ever to track local gas prices. Smartphone apps like Waze and GasBuddy are designed to help drivers find the lowest gas prices in a given area. Rather than stopping at the first gas station you see, you can often hold out for a better deal down the road. Eat in whenever you can. If your RV has a kitchen in it, use it . It can be tempting to pull over at a rest stop for a bite to eat, but that will cost you more money in the long run. It will also promote unhealthy eating habits. You’re much better off preparing meals in your mobile kitchen instead. Ready to embark on your next camping adventure? We have more than 100 full hook-up sites so you can always find room at Suwannee River Rendezvous. Give us a call or contact us online to reserve your spot today! No Comments filed under: Suwannee RV Resort Tags: Budgeting , Gas Prices , Meal Preparation , Travel Expenses Gift Ideas for the Camping Enthusiast in Your Life Posted November 27, 2017 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Is there someone in your life who loves to go camping? If so, there are plenty of great gifts to consider this holiday season. To help get you started, we put together a few of our favorite gifts for camping enthusiasts. Check them out below. Portable stoves Cooking on a campfire certainly has its charms, but it’s not always a practical option. That’s why a good camping stove is nearly essential for overnight backpacking trips. This compact stove from MSR, for example, is small enough to fit in a cargo pocket, but powerful enough to boil water in under 4 minutes. Camping hammocks It’s not always easy to find a comfortable place to rest when you’re out in the wilderness, so a camping hammock is a great accessory to keep in your pack. Just anchor one of these lightweight, portable hammocks to two trees and you’ve got a comfortable place to take a nap and watch the world go by. Water purifiers It’s always a good idea to have one of these on hand when camping in remote areas. In the past, you may have had to purchase water purification tablets. Nowadays, however, you can find hand-operated pumps that filter water without chemicals. With one of these handy tools, you can always find potable water at the nearest stream. If you’re still struggling to find the right gift, why not treat your loved one to a camping trip on the beautiful Suwannee River? Book your reservation today, or give us a call to learn more! No Comments filed under: Camping Tags: Camping Gear , Christmas Gifts , Holiday Season Research Finds Camping Can Help Reset Our Body Clocks Posted November 10, 2017 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort If you love the great outdoors, than you know how restorative spending time in nature can be. But did you know it can even help you overcome sleep problems? New research shows that camping can help reset our internal body clocks. Reset Due to our frequent exposure to artificial light, many humans stray from a natural sleeping pattern. But one week of camping outdoors and getting away from artificial light sources is enough to return a person’s body clock to its natural sleep rhythms, according to a recent study published in Current Biology . These findings demonstrate that our internal biological clocks will quickly synchronize to a natural light-dark cycle if the opportunity arises. Easier to wake up During their one week of camping, the study participants’ average light exposure increased by more than four times. This added exposure to natural light caused changes in their brains’ melatonin production , which made it easier to wake up from a restful sleep. Better Sleep Many of the participants who usually experienced sleep issues claimed this was the only time they were able to get uninterrupted sleep by going to bed early and waking up early. This suggests that carefully controlling our exposure to artificial light, particularly at night, could help successfully treat sleep problems. For a relaxing and rejuvenating camping experience to get your sleep schedule back on track, come visit us here at Suwannee River Rendezvous in Mayo, Florida! We offer a variety of primitive, water/electric and full hook-up sites. Contact us today for more information!

In addition to being a whole lot of fun, camping can also offer some very real health benefits. Reduce Stress Levels According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress is something that affects millions of Americans every year. If the demands of everyday life have been taking a toll on your nerves, a camping trip is a great opportunity to unwind and reduce your stress levels in a peaceful, natural setting. Getting Away from Crowds Sometimes, everyday life can leave us overstimulated, especially with work, people, and daily tasks. These things can build-up and sometimes we need a break from the crowded lives we live. Camping can give you the chance to escape to a quiet place at a state park or national park. Bring a friend or two that needs the same escape! Breathe Fresh Air Simply breathing some fresh air can be hugely beneficial to your overall health and well-being. Trees produce plenty of clean oxygen, which can promote serotonin production, aid in digestion and boost your immune system. Learn New Things Stepping outside of your comfort zone and learning new things can also help keep your mind sharp and healthy. From learning how to read a compass to campfire building and meal preparation, there is always more to learn on a camping trip. Plus, all that extra physical activity can stimulate your mind as well. Ready to enjoy a refreshing camping experience in Florida? We’d love to see you at Suwannee River Rendezvous! Give us a call or contact us online to book your reservation today! One Comment filed under: Camping Tags: Fresh Air , Mental Health , Physical Activity , Stress Reduction Keep Camping More Environmentally Friendly Posted November 4, 2022 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Want to minimize your impact on the local ecosystem during your next camping trip? Camping offers a great way for people to reconnect with the great outdoors, but it can have some unintended consequences on nearby plants and animals if we’re not careful. Check out a few of our favorite environmentally-friendly camping ideas below! Leave the Plastic Water Bottles at Home It’s important to stay hydrated when camping, hiking and canoeing, but that doesn’t mean you need to pack cases of disposable water bottles that will wind up in a landfill. Instead, use a water bladder or reusable bottle that won’t create additional waste. This way, we can all do our part to cut down on the 50 billion water bottles that are consumed each year. Take Everything you Brought Camping Home with You After spending a few days in the woods, you might be tempted to toss some things in the garbage instead of bringing them home with you. Rather than leaving these items behind, try to make sure you have everything you brought with you when you leave your campsite. Any remaining waste and recyclables should be sorted and disposed of in designated collection centers. Stay in Designated Camping Sites If you’re an experienced outdoor enthusiast, you might enjoy camping off the beaten path in remote areas that don’t have established campsites. Unfortunately, this can disrupt sensitive habitats and leave lasting environmental damage as well. In general, it’s best to stay at designated campgrounds rather than make your own campsite in areas that have been undisturbed by humans. At Suwannee River Rendezvous , we offer comfortable camping accommodations with environmentally-friendly amenities like recycling containers and water hook-ups.

Learn how to build a great campfire with these helpful tips: First, gather your tinder—material that will catch fire and burn fast. This includes dry grasses, leaves, bark and wood shavings. Many campers also like having firelighter cubes on hand. Make sure all the wood you’re using is dry. Wet wood is not only harder to burn, it’s also more prone to generating smoke and small bits of debris. There are three popular campfire designs to consider: a cone, a log cabin and a pyramid. You can familiarize yourself with these three options here and choose the one that works best for you. Using a match or lighter, light the tinder. Then, blow gently on the base of the fire to add oxygen, which will intensify the flame and help light the larger pieces of wood. Stay near your fire as it burns. Never leave a campfire unattended . As the fire burns, move embers toward the center so they’ll be completely burned. Ideally, you should burn them until they become white ash. Eventually, it will be time to extinguish your fire. Pour water on it, stir the ashes and repeat as many times as needed. Before you leave the fire, make sure the remaining ashes are cool to the touch. Now that you know how to build a great campfire, it’s time to book a campsite! Check out the Suwannee River Rendezvous campground and RV resort , where each campsite comes equipped with its very own fire pit. Contact us today at (386) 294-2510 to book your spot. No Comments filed under: Camping Tags: Campfires , Camping Trips , Fire Safety Fishing this Fall in Suwannee River Posted September 20, 2022 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort There are few activities in life as fulfilling or relaxing as enjoying some quality fishing, and if you can do it in such a beautiful place as Suwannee River then that is even better! Here at Suwannee River Rendezvous, anglers can enjoy some of fun in the sun right alongside this famous river as you try to catch some of the most sought-after fish in the area. There is plenty of great fishing to be had with Suwannee bass, largemouth bass, channel catfish, blue gill, sunfish and more up for grabs within the river’s waters. Fishing is a splendid way to bond with your loved ones or just get away from it all and spend some time soaking in the glory of nature as you let your worries slip away. It is also a chance for the little ones to experience a connection with nature that they just can’t get in the real world. But don’t take our word for it – check out our gallery of fishing fun featuring adventurers of all ages! No License? No Problem! As with all forms of hunting, some restrictions and regulations must be met. When fishing here in Florida, a fishing license is required – most of the time, anyway, as the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission offers a few days each year for license-free fishing. The free freshwater days are the first Saturday and Sunday in April and the second Saturday and Sunday in June, so if you’re thinking of making a trip from out of state on those dates, make sure to bring your poles and fish without needing a license. Don’t forget: Fishing restrictions still apply on those dates, so be sure to review the state rules on catch and size limits . Nothing Beats Fishing at Suwannee River Rendezvous In the end, it is important to remember that fishing at the Rendezvous is really all about fun, relaxation and the love of the sport.

Congratulations! Traveling in an RV is a great way to explore the country. But before you go, you should take some time to familiarize yourself with RVing so that you can make the most of the experience. Check out a few essential tips for your first RV trip below! Come up with a plan—but don’t be afraid to deviate from it! When you first hit the road, you should have a general idea of where you’re going. Otherwise, you’re going to waste a lot of gas and potentially miss out on some amazing sites. Plan out some destinations you want to see, but don’t feel like you have to follow every single turn on the map. Allow yourself to take detours and visit sites that weren’t on your itinerary. Embrace the spontaneity that RVing offers. Find time for yourself throughout your trip. While the average RV offers plenty of space for you to stretch out, you’re still going to be spending a lot of time with your fellow passengers. Whenever you get the chance, find a way to make a little time for yourself. Whether that means taking a walk on a nearby trail or retreating to the back of the RV with headphones, a little alone time can go a long way during a road trip. Ask questions of your fellow RVers along the way. When you stop at an RV campsite, you’re going to come in contact with lots of other people on similar journeys! Don’t be afraid to ask questions or let them know about any concerns you may have. You may be able to learn a lot from these more experienced travelers. Next time you’re in Florida, be sure to visit our RV Resort on the beautiful Suwannee River! Give us a call to learn more, or book your reservation online today! No Comments filed under: Suwannee RV Resort Tags: Road Trips , RV Trips , Traveling , Vacation Destinations Tips for Tent Camping with Your Family Posted July 12, 2022 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Camping is a fantastic activity for any young child. There is so much to learn and discover in the wonder of nature, removed from the noise and distractions of society for a little while. It is relaxing to just unplug from the hustle and bustle of life, but that doesn’t mean that your children can’t also learn something while spending time camping. Beyond just developing and growing your son or daughter’s appreciation for the wilderness, kids can learn a few important things about life from taking a camping trip. Basic Camp Setup The first thing that your child can learn is how to set up a campsite upon arrival. This involves many different steps, from identifying the best place to set up a tent, to clearing a tent location from stick and rocks, how to set a tent up and more. They can also help with other setup tasks, like putting up tarps for shade or rain protection, as well as gathering firewood and kindling. This will set your child up for success for your next camping trip and any trips they may take with friends or other family members in the future. Break Out of the Routine As previously mentioned, it is often wonderful to take a break from your busy schedule and do something a bit different. Camping allows you to take part in unplanned activities each day without having to worry about meetings or what time it is. Activities like fishing, canoeing or hiking are fantastic ways to snap out of the norm and experience something new, and can even introduce children to a new favorite hobby or pastime. Get In Touch With Nature Fishing and hiking are great ways to gain an appreciation for nature. Catching then reeling in your first fish is an experience unlike any other. The feeling of that fish in your hand after you’ve reeled it in is something you never forget, and can introduce a child to a lifetime love for the sport. Hiking is another fun outdoor option, and gives you and your child a chance to see nature you wouldn’t normally see in your backyard. Seeing wild animals in their native habitat is a serene experience and can make your child appreciate the world around them that much more. How to Build a Fire Building a fire is an essential skill for anyone. When you grow up, you might need to light a fire in a fireplace or create a small fire during a tailgate or while on another camping trip. Your child’s first camping trip is the perfect time for them to learn how to start a fire from scratch. It’s a lifelong skill that your son or daughter can carry with them for the rest of their life. It’s still camping season here in Florida, so there’s ample time to book a weekend camping trip for you and your family! Suwannee River Rendezvous has many primitive campsites available as well as sites that offer electric and water connections for those who don’t want to full rough it. Our affordable rates mean that your camping trip won’t break the bank, either. Book your camping trip today or learn more about our campsites by calling 386-294-2510.

Since summers are mostly hot in Florida, you must adjust your camping materials and equipment to ensure an enjoyable camping trip here. One of the most important tips when it comes to camping in general is to always pack light and only bring the essentials. Now, you don’t have to stick to a boring camping trip, but don’t over pack unnecessary items. Here are some tips on packing light for your summer trip.

Bug spray, protective clothing, and sunscreen are just to name a few extra items that you should bring. Planning Your Days Out One of the biggest things campers don’t plan out is their days while on the camping trip. This is one of the most important aspects of planning out the adventure. If you’re able to plan each day (without too many restrictions), you can make sure that you are packing the right equipment for those days. We want to make sure that you don’t restrict your flexibility on the trip, though. Camping is about relaxation and enjoying the great outdoors, so you don’t want to have a strict itinerary.

Sometimes it can be tough when you get all unpacked at the campsite, and then have nothing planned for some of the hours of the weekend.

Hot, humid weather can make tent camping a little challenging during the peak months of summer, but it doesn’t have to keep you from having a good time. In fact, with a little care and preparation, you can camp comfortably and enjoy yourself even on the warmest days of the year! Here are some tips to help you stay cool: Stay Hydrated Of course, this is the most important thing to keep in mind on especially hot days. Drinking plenty of water will not only prevent you from getting dehydrated, but also help to regulate your body temperature so that you don’t overheat. Keep a bottle of water on hand at all times, and consider packing some refreshing snacks like cucumbers and watermelons for the trip as well. Stay Dry Circulation is key for keeping your tent cool overnight, but it can be problematic if you get surprised by a summer rainstorm. If your tent’s rain fly makes it feel hot and stuffy inside, create a canopy over your tent by tying a tarp to a couple of nearby trees instead. This will keep your tent dry without blocking air flow and impeding circulation. Dress Ligh t How hot you feel depends largely on what you’re wearing, and certain materials perform better in heat than others. In general, you should avoid clothes made of cotton. For shirts, consider a merino wool base layer that washes well and is light to wear. These days, you can also find active-wear pants that are soft, light and capable of wicking away excess moisture. Be sure to bring a good pair of waterproof shoes, too; if you’re sweaty, you don’t want your feet to be. Getting ready to plan this year’s summer camping getaway? We’d love to see you at Suwannee River Rendezvous . If you’re nervous about the heat, you can even stay in one of our air conditioned vacation homes !

At that time there were only a few buildings and the primitive campground area . Frank started cleaning the area and stabilizing all the buildings. In 2009 another 20 acres was purchased, which is now considered the upper area of the Rendezvous. In 2010, another seven acres were added to the property. Frank planned and constructed the Upper Rendezvous area which was completed in 2012 and added 136 RV sites as well as the dog park, barn and pigeon coop. The dog park has five sections, for both small and large dogs, with ample room to run. Frank began raising pigeons in 2012. The first pigeons purchased were homing pigeons which started the Pigeon Races that are still a fun, family favorite event on Saturday afternoons. Frank also purchased and started raising other pigeons, the Birmingham Roller. Birmingham Rollers are a very popular breed of domesticated pigeons that originated in Birmingham, England, where they were developed via selective breeding, for their ability to do rapid backward somersaults while flying. You can often see them flying around the Upper Rendezvous in the mornings and afternoons. These pigeons are used for our weekly Pigeon Races. There have always been chickens at the Rendezvous; however, Chicken Poo Bingo started in 2016. According to the Wall Street Journal, the concept of the game was invented in a New Orleans bar during the 1980s. Chicken Poo Bingo is exclusive to the Rendezvous here in the State of Florida. Grandma Susie’s Cookin’ Shack has a varied menu and serves Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. You can take out, eat in our indoor or outdoor seating area. Another great feature here at the Rendezvous is the Suwannee River where you can plan a kayak or canoe trip here. We have a 6 mile trip and two 12 mile trips which include shuttle service. Shuttle service is also available for those who have their own equipment. All trips are a full day rental and include shuttle service, paddles, and life jackets. The Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort & Campground is home to Convict Spring. Convict Spring is a natural fresh water spring that feeds the Suwannee River. The spring is a “cool” place to swim. It is also home to small fish and some turtles. Additions to the Rendezvous include the Catch and Release Pond, which is stocked and does not require a Florida Fishing License. Please respect the resident Peking ducks as the pond is their home. Our newest addition is the Outdoor Dining Deck which overlooks Convict Spring where you can see the high-level markers from floods throughout the years. Stay tuned for more information on our future Entertainment Complex. Our management team has over 50 years of resort experience. With that in mind, know that we are constantly working to provide you an experience that will provide a lifetime of memories. We invite you to join us on the beautiful Suwannee River .

No Comments filed under: River Lore Camping in North Florida: Your Complete Guide to Adventure Posted July 28, 2025 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort North Florida offers some of the most diverse and accessible camping experiences in the Southeast. From the rolling hills of the panhandle to the pristine springs of the north-central region, this area combines Southern charm with natural beauty that will leave you planning your next trip before you’ve even packed up camp. Whether you’re a seasoned outdoor enthusiast or someone considering their first camping adventure, North Florida’s welcoming terrain and mild climate make it an ideal destination to explore the great outdoors. Why North Florida is Perfect for Camping Unlike the more tourist-heavy destinations further south, North Florida provides a more authentic wilderness experience without sacrificing accessibility. The region boasts over 160 state parks, national forests, and recreation areas, each offering unique landscapes from coastal dunes to hardwood hammocks. The climate is generally more forgiving than other parts of Florida, with cooler winters and less oppressive summer humidity, making year-round camping a realistic option. The area’s geological diversity means you can experience everything from cave systems and natural springs to rolling hills and pristine beaches, often within a short drive of each other. This variety ensures that every camping trip can offer something new, whether you’re interested in swimming in crystal-clear springs, hiking through canopy roads, or exploring historic sites. Essential Gear for North Florida Camping Shelter and Sleep System A quality tent is your foundation for comfortable camping. Choose a three-season tent with good ventilation to handle Florida’s humidity. Look for models with a full rainfly and sturdy construction to withstand afternoon thunderstorms. A footprint or tarp underneath adds protection from ground moisture. Your sleep system should include a sleeping bag rated for temperatures 10-15 degrees below expected lows, as North Florida can experience surprising temperature drops, especially in winter. An insulated sleeping pad is crucial not just for comfort, but for insulation from the ground, which can sap body heat even in mild weather. Clothing and Personal Items Pack layers for North Florida’s variable weather. Include moisture-wicking base layers, insulating mid-layers, and a waterproof outer shell. Don’t forget extra socks and underwear – staying dry is key to staying comfortable and healthy outdoors. Essential personal items include a first aid kit, flashlight or headlamp with extra batteries, sunscreen (the Florida sun is intense even in winter), insect repellent, and personal hygiene items. A quick-dry towel saves space and weight while providing versatility. Cooking and Food Storage A reliable camping stove with adequate fuel allows you to prepare hot meals regardless of fire restrictions. Pack lightweight, non-perishable foods, but don’t forget to include some treats that make the experience special. A good cooler with plenty of ice keeps perishables safe and drinks cold. Water is critical – bring more than you think you’ll need, especially during summer months. Even if your campsite has water access, having your own supply ensures you’re never caught short during activities away from camp. Tools and Utilities A multi-tool or good knife serves countless purposes around camp. Rope or paracord, duct tape, and zip ties handle most repair and rigging needs. Don’t forget camping chairs for comfort around the fire and a table or flat surface for food preparation and games.

No Comments filed under: River Lore Reconnecting with Nature: Why Camping Benefits Your Mental and Physical Wellbeing Posted January 7, 2025 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort In our increasingly digital world, where screens dominate our daily lives and artificial lighting disrupts our natural rhythms, camping offers a powerful antidote. This age-old activity provides more than just a change of scenery – it delivers profound benefits for both mental and physical health. The Restorative Power of Nature When you step into the wilderness, something remarkable happens to your stress levels. Research has shown that spending time in nature reduces cortisol, the body’s primary stress hormone. The simple act of being surrounded by trees, listening to birdsong, and breathing fresh air triggers our body’s relaxation response. This natural stress reduction isn’t just a temporary fix – regular exposure to nature has been linked to improved mental health outcomes and reduced risk of anxiety and depression. Breaking Free from Digital Chains Camping forces us to disconnect from our devices and reconnect with ourselves and others. Without constant notifications and email alerts, our minds can finally rest from the cognitive overload of modern life. This digital detox allows us to practice mindfulness naturally – whether we’re tending to a campfire, observing wildlife, or simply watching clouds drift across the sky. Better Sleep Through Natural Light One of camping’s most significant benefits comes from realigning our circadian rhythms. When we live by natural light rather than artificial illumination, our bodies better regulate sleep hormones like melatonin. Campers often report sleeping better outdoors, and this improved sleep pattern can persist even after returning home. The combination of physical activity, natural light exposure, and reduced blue light from screens creates optimal conditions for restorative rest. Physical Activity Without Effort Unlike traditional exercise, camping makes physical activity feel effortless and enjoyable. Setting up camp, gathering firewood, hiking to scenic spots – these activities engage our bodies in natural, functional movements. The varied terrain challenges our balance and proprioception, while carrying gear builds strength. Best of all, we’re so engaged in the experience that it rarely feels like “exercise.” Social Connection in Its Purest Form Camping creates unique opportunities for meaningful social connection. Without technological distractions, conversations become deeper and more engaging. Sharing tasks like setting up tents or preparing meals fosters cooperation and strengthens bonds. The shared experience of overcoming small challenges and enjoying simple pleasures together creates lasting memories and strengthens relationships. Developing Resilience and Self-Reliance There’s something empowering about successfully managing life’s basics in an outdoor setting. Learning to start a fire, set up shelter, or navigate a trail builds confidence and self-reliance. These experiences develop problem-solving skills and resilience that translate back to everyday life. Each camping trip teaches us that we’re more capable than we might have thought. Environmental Awareness and Appreciation Regular camping experiences foster a deeper connection with the natural world. This connection often leads to increased environmental awareness and a stronger commitment to conservation. When we spend time in nature, we better understand our place within the larger ecosystem and our responsibility to protect it. Practical Tips for Getting Started If you’re new to camping, start small. Try a well-maintained campground with basic facilities before venturing into more remote areas. Borrow or rent equipment for your first few trips to avoid major investments. Most importantly, remember that camping doesn’t have to be extreme to be beneficial – even a simple overnight stay in nature can provide significant wellness benefits. The beauty of camping lies in its simplicity. In an era where wellness trends come and go, camping remains a timeless way to improve both mental and physical health. By temporarily stepping away from modern conveniences, we often find exactly what we need: peace, perspective, and a renewed sense of vitality. Whether you’re an experienced outdoors person or a nervous novice, the natural world is waiting to share its healing powers with you. So next time you’re feeling overwhelmed or disconnected, consider packing a tent and heading into nature. Your mind and body will thank you for it.

No Comments filed under: River Lore Don’t Leave Home Without These: Top 10 RV Trip Essentials Posted October 25, 2024 by Suwannee River Rendezvous Resort Top 10 RV Trip Essentials Planning an RV adventure? While the excitement of hitting the open road might have you eager to just hop in and drive, forgetting crucial items can quickly turn your dream vacation into a challenging experience. Here’s your must-pack list of the top 10 items that often slip travelers’ minds but are absolute game-changers for RV living. 1. Surge Protector and Electrical Management System Nothing ruins an RV trip faster than fried electronics. Campground power can be unpredictable, and a quality surge protector isn’t just an accessory—it’s insurance for your valuable RV systems. Invest in a good 30 or 50 amp surge protector (matching your RV’s requirements) to protect against power surges, low voltage, and reverse polarity. 2. Sewer Hose Support System While everyone remembers the sewer hose, many forget the support system. These elevated supports create a proper slope for your sewer hose, ensuring efficient drainage and preventing the dreaded “low spot” that can trap waste. Trust me, this $20 investment will save you countless headaches. 3. Leveling Blocks and Wheel Chocks Perfect camping spots rarely come with perfectly level ground. A good set of leveling blocks will keep your RV stable and your appliances functioning properly. Wheel chocks are equally important—they’re not just for parking on hills but are essential for safety whenever you’re parked. 4. Water Pressure Regulator Campground water pressure can vary wildly, sometimes exceeding levels safe for your RV’s plumbing. A water pressure regulator protects your pipes and connections from potentially damaging high-pressure water. Get one with a gauge so you can monitor the pressure levels. 5. Basic Tool Kit You don’t need to bring your entire garage, but a basic tool kit is essential. Include: Screwdrivers (flathead and Phillips) Adjustable wrench Pliers Duct tape WD-40 Zip ties Battery-powered drill 6. Emergency Road Kit Beyond your basic tool kit, pack: Tire pressure gauge Flashlights with extra batteries Jump starter or jumper cables Basic first aid supplies Emergency flares or reflective triangles Extra fuses 7. RV-Specific Toilet Paper and Tank Treatment Regular household toilet paper can wreak havoc on RV plumbing systems. Pack RV-specific toilet paper and don’t forget tank treatment chemicals to break down waste and control odors. Your nose (and your black water tank) will thank you later. 8. Weather Station A small weather station with temperature and humidity readings helps you monitor conditions inside and outside your RV. This is particularly important for protecting your RV from freezing temperatures or excessive heat, which can damage systems and make camping uncomfortable. 9. Backup Camera System If your RV doesn’t have one built-in, a wireless backup camera system is invaluable. It not only helps with parking but also provides peace of mind when changing lanes or maneuvering in tight spaces. Consider it an essential safety item, not a luxury. 10. Documentation Folder Create a folder containing: RV owner’s manual Appliance manuals Campground reservations RV insurance documents Vehicle registration Emergency contact numbers Campground membership cards Maps (yes, physical maps—don’t rely solely on GPS) Final Thoughts While this list covers the often-forgotten essentials, remember that every RV trip is unique. Consider your specific needs, destination, and season when packing. It’s better to have these items and not need them than to need them and not have them. Happy camping! Pro Tip: Keep a running checklist of items you wish you had brought on previous trips. Your perfect packing list will evolve with experience.
