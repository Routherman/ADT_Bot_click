Clint L wrote a review Oct 2024 1 contribution 5 of 5 bubbles Great couples getaway First impressions, the property is in great condition and  as soon as you walk in, you’re  greeted by the friendly staff at the valet stand and then at the front desk. Nikolaus became a friendly face that we saw every day passing through the lobby, saying hello, remembering our names and always asking us how our day was going. The front desk was always helpful and always ready to give a recommendation for whatever you’re looking for in town. We did have dinner at the restaurant on the property (Baleen)  which was phenomenal. They set us up on a table outside right on the beach so you could listen to the waves coming up as you eat. Food was incredible, and the drinks were just as good! Overall service between the restaurant and the hotel was way above expectation. The beach is amazing and they always had open chairs and umbrellas for you to go choose from. They have this great system where you raise a flag when you would like to order food or drinks so you’re never waiting too long. Drinks and food from the tiki bar were very good. The spa is very nice and the services provided there are top-notch. The golf course is in amazing condition and if you need to use rental clubs, they do have great rental clubs that are not 100 years old. Overall, we enjoyed our experience very much, no complaints and are looking forward to going back! Thanks again to Nikolaus and the rest of the staff that made our trip memorable and special. -Clint & Lauren Read more Read less Date of stay: September 2024 Trip type: Travelled as a couple 5 of 5 bubbles Value 5 of 5 bubbles Rooms 5 of 5 bubbles Location 5 of 5 bubbles Cleanliness 5 of 5 bubbles Service 5 of 5 bubbles Sleep Quality This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Siobhan A wrote a review May 2015 Bristol, United Kingdom 7 contributions 2 helpful votes 5 of 5 bubbles Perfect Location with friendly atmosphere, good food and great service. A delightful hotel right on a fabulous beach. All the facilities you could ever need. The food is good, the drinks are generous, the staff are friendly but efficient. We saw loads of amazing birds, dolphins swimming and jumping by the shore and turtles coming to nest. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend. The hotel is also a members beach/ Golf club so it does not feel like a chain hotel and there can be more locals than tourists which is great.

Your review really touched on the core areas of hospitality that our team strives to provide daily, and we couldn't be more pleased with your kind comments. Additionally, we’re glad you enjoyed all the unique wildlife that accompanies our pristine location directly on Vanderbilt Beach. We actually just entered loggerhead turtle nesting season on May 1st, so guests over the summer may also be fortunate enough to encounter turtle nests along our private stretch of Vanderbilt beach. Thank you again for your review and recommendation of our boutique resort. We hope to have the opportunity to see you again the next time you visit Southwest Florida.

Discerning Traveller wrote a review Feb 2019 3 contributions 2 helpful votes 2 of 5 bubbles Disappointed - poor quality of room, amenities The room was dated, a one star bathroom in an ocean/Gulf view room. No water in an $800 a night room. We had bugs in the bath tub and on the bathroom floor.The Resort is  Beach and Golf resort yet the resort does not provide any transport to the Golf Course . And, guest are paying premium fees for golf. The staff for the most part were friendly and courteous but there were some who haven't realized they are in a service industry, For the price (expensive) the hotel does not live up to the price it charges.
