The staff was AMAZING. The food was the talk of the evening! Rebecca Del Torro was awesome, she helped us plan our special day from beginning to end and was very attentive. She listened to what we wanted for our day and helped to ensure that it was exactly what we had envisioned and then some! I would definitely recommend this location. I would also like to say that the event staff mainly Erica was there as well from the beginning of the event to the very end making sure that everything went smoothly. Their prices were great and the entire staff was professional and prepared for every tiny detail. N. De Los Santos The ceremony site was out on the golf course and made for beautiful pictures! We loved our wedding and everything turned out GREAT! All our guests complimented us on how beautiful everything was. We were very excited to have found the venue, and even more delighted to have found Rebecca as the event manager. From the first conversation with Rebecca, she was genuinely interested in helping us achieve our vision and create an unforgettable day. P. Murray My husband and I got married at Chula Vista and it was purely amazing. All of our guests had nothing but great things to say about our wedding. They were so amazed at how organized everything was from the ceremony to the reception. The ceremony outside in the golf course was just a sight to see. J. Meninges Last night we held our son's wedding reception at the Chula Vista Golf Course. They did a fantastic job from beginning to end. Working with Rebecca, Ryan, Erica and the rest of the staff was a great experience. The servers were attentive, the food was good, and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. J. Yumen First of all, I want to thank Rebecca for her incredible amount of dedication to her work. She has such a talent for coordinating events like weddings, and I cannot thank her enough. The venue itself is beautiful, the room had a great view of the course with beautiful large windows which is draped with white curtains. For the price, location, and size of venue alone, it is highly recommended and will definitely be using this venue again in the future. K.

Tournament Reviews We had our wedding ceremony and cocktail reception at the Chula Vista Golf Course and we couldn’t of been happier with the experience. Chris, Rebecca, Justin and the catering staff were fantastic! We had originally planned to have an outdoor ceremony but because of rain, we had to move it inside. The staff rearranged the ballroom for our ceremony and it turned out great. We opted for a cocktail reception rather than a sit down dinner and we are so happy we chose that route. Chris and Justin worked with us in advance to create the menu which even included churro donuts, cookies and milk towards the end of the night. The food was amazing and we received so many compliments about it. We highly recommend this location for your event. D. Schreck For a public course this place was all class. Found somebody's wedge and got it to them, lost our putter cover and got it back, was on stand-by as a threesome and teed off within 5 minutes, son received free golf balls from one of the marshals, just a perfect day. Everyone fixed their ball marks so the greens are true. Lots of fun. F. Ferguson Enjoyed the driving range and the atmosphere of the club house... staff was friendly and helpful and the other patrons were extremely kind... great place to visit during my vacation.
