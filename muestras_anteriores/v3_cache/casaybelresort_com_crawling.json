      "text": "Casa Ybel Resort--Owner's Forum Inputs From Owners - Hurricane Charley August 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 September 2004 | October 2004 | November 2004 | December 2004 | January 2005 February/March 2005 | April/May 2005 August 20, 2004: Statements on the Hospitality web site has created \n    some confusion amongst the Casa Ybel owners. That Hospitality web site is www.casaybelresort.com and is not an owners web \n    site. It is not Casa Ybel owner's web site, but a web site made by a \n    subcontractor to Hilton Grand Vacation and does not represent ownership of \n    Casa Ybel Condominiums, only ownership of Thistle Lodge, front office and \n    some common areas. That same web site states that Casa Ybel Resort hotel \n    accommodations are intact with no water or wind damage.!!! Hospitality makes their income from the Casa Ybel owners and their \n    maintenance fees and also hurt the owners by offering a 10% discount on all \n    rentals placed by owners on the owners web site www.CasaYbel.com. This \n    discount must come out of the owners pockets. Hospitality has been given an \n    exclusive controversial contract by the Casa Ybel owners own Board for the \n    Board not to inform Casa Ybel owners of their own web site CasaYbel.com, and \n    force rentals to the front office on CasaYbelResort.com ================ CasaYbelResort.com, subcontractor to management company Hilton Grand \n    Vacation, To The Management Staff of Casa Ybel, I am an owner (Week 27 - G211 Week 28 - G209) and have some obvious concerns \n    relating to the condition of my timeshares. I have gone up to your web site \n    and I have read the very brief description given as to the resort / hotel's \n    status post hurricane. I find it hard to believe that there was no damage to \n    any of the buildings. Especially since the resort was shown on a national \n    news network with footage shot from a helicopter showing a building sans \n    roof. I would like further details as to: 1) What will the insurance policy be covering? Did we have adequate \n    coverage? 2) What is the real status if Building G? 3) As the management company, are you going to communicate the resorts \n    status to the owners? 4) Since when is the resort a hotel and how can it be open for business \n    without electricity or phones? I am very concerned over your lack of communication to this point and would \n    appreciate some real answers. I believe that you have an obligation to the \n    management company and owners to provide the timeshare owners with \n    information. Martha Ayala ================= Typical concern from owner, action needed: Dear Carl: THANK YOU for your update on the Casa Ybel site. We are owners of Week 38 - \n    Building G 205. We have been watching the local TV in Ft Myers (on the net) \n    and have been checking the Sanibel site, as well. HOWEVER -- could the Board \n    PLEASE notify those of us who have units, and have plans to come down (in \n    our case - Sept 17th) as soon as the extent of the damage can be assessed, \n    so we can cancel our plane, car, etc, if necessary, or continue to make our \n    vacation plans, if possible. Again...thanks so much for any info you can supply. We'd love to see more \n    extensive video of the complex - if one of you could do that, once you're \n    allowed in! (We have seen the nbc-2 aerial photos). Sincerely, Julius Duquette ===================== Fellow Casa Ybel Owners; The eye of hurricane Charley passed 5 miles from Sanibel Island Friday the \n    13th around 3:10PM. It then turned towards a NNE direction and passed across North Captiva, \n    which was cut in half, and on to Punta Gorda, where the worst damage was \n    recorded. By now, Sunday, Charley is passing Cape Cod on its way to the \n    Atlantic Ocean. A fast train taking the scenic vacation drive. In response to the many e-mails and phone calls I have received today, \n    Sunday Aug. 15th, I can presently give you only a very general report. \n    Unfortunately our electric power in Ft Myers was lost just about the same \n    time our local Doppler radar showed the eye so close to Sanibel. TV-cable \n    and cell phone support disappeared after the loss of local transmission \n    towers. The electric power was returned to Lehigh Acres within 25 hours, but \n    most locations in Lee County are still without power. My home is in Lehigh \n    Acres some 30 miles east of Sanibel. All I lost was my pool enclosure and \n    some trees to winds somewhat short of the 145 miles per hour at Sanibel. Today Aug 15, access to the web has been restored, and in response I can \n    report the following information about conditions on Sanibel. (Fort Myers \n    News Press) The causeway is closed, and Sanibel Police and Firefighters, with the help \n    of Lee County Sheriff Deputies and 50 National Guard Troops are protecting \n    the Island from Boats and Cars. Aerial survey has shown that the bay side of Sanibel suffered mainly roof \n    damages, while on the Gulf side screen enclosures and roofs took the brunt \n    of the hurricane force winds. Interior subdivisions sustained \"hit and miss\" damage according to the \n    observers. Some aerial photos indicated missing roofs and exposed units. The Island will be closed for several more days to allow inspection teams to \n    explore safety of buildings and clear Periwinkle Drive. Drinking Water is \n    contaminated, and electric power has not been available yet. It is mentioned \n    that South Seas took a major hit, and hospitality people are not expecting \n    access to vacation units for for up to 2 months, which could be true for \n    Sanibel also. When I have definitive information regarding damage to Casa \n    Ybel I will report it on this website. Punta Gorda took the major damage, mostly due to the many mobile and \n    manufactured homes present there. Most news casts and TV pictures you see \n    from Charley originated from Punta Gorda I do not feel you can compare the 2 target areas, as Sanibel has much higher \n    building code standards. For aerials of Hurricane Charley damages go to http://www.nbc-2.com For Casa \n    Ybel aerial in particular go to Video then: Sanibel aerials, part 2. 55% \n    into the video you will see new aerials of CASA YBEL - Carl ====== <August 21, 2004> ======== Dear Mr. Appleberg, Hopefully you can advise me as to what I should do if anything. I own week \n    35 / 215G and have not heard a word. My calls have not been returned and I \n    know other owners have been called and told not to come. I guess my question \n    is, is there any type of compensation....This year due to circumstances it \n    was a bit of a hardship to get my fees paid, but I did, knowing that at \n    least I would have a weeks vacation. Now I am here with a plane ticket, car \n    reservation, and no information. I read on the HGV website that CasaYbel \n    sustained a great amount of damage but still have not been notified. I \n    certainly do not have a few extra thousand to stay at another resort. Now \n    with time off from work and a ticket I will be penalized for I don';t know \n    where to turn....Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Debra Yessel ============== Carl, Thank you for keeping us informed. We had nurtured some hopes of using our \n    second week (37) based on the statement on the resort web page. I think your \n    photo's helped dispel that notion. Dick ============== Hi Carl, thanks for the email. I was so glad to see the pictures. from the outside \n    doesnt look that bad so must be all inside water damage. arlene ============== For whatever it's worth, I agree with your financial suggestions... Thanks so much for continuing to update us! Jill ============== Before I was able to send this memo I received a communication from Janet Wilder which makes me unsure that she reviewed Carl Appleberg's memo from yesterday morning, Therefore, I am sending it intact and you may choose to address it or ignore it for it's content. Based on the last email I August 19 from Carl I am a little more than dismayed and upset. I sent an email to Carl, Joe D'Alessandro and Janet Wilder on 8/18/04 indicating I had apprehensions at the time about the call from Hilton and my felling that it was premature (and suspicious). It appears from the response from Carl that was received today that we have some very real problems with Hilton's management in general and specifically at our resort. As always, it, takes a disaster to really see who is doing the right thing and who is not. Most disturbing is the message on Casaybelresort.com about \"Hotel Accommodations\" and the general description that the \"Hotel\" accommodations are \"intact with no water or wind damage.\" We all know from the helicopter view of the premises that this is a bald faced lie! It seems very strange to me that I was called by Hilton and told explicitly that there would be no check-ins for my week 8/27 even though no one from Hilton had been on the island yet, much less know what damage was present. It appears to me that Hilton's first priority is to open Thistle Lodge, the pool, and other common areas, to restart their cash flow, at the expense of the owners of the \"Hotel\". I personally think that G.M. AWILDA RIVERA and Hilton management should be strongly taken to task for their very questionable practices and suspicious behavior. I would really hate to think that I, as an owner, have been told not to show up but Hilton will be renting out units during this period. If that were so and one of them was mine this would most probably constitute a felony in the State of Florida. While this may sound a little far fetched I can only say that as a police officer, investigator and detective since 1964 I have seen far stranger things in far less serious circumstances. Our attorney should be notified immediately since it would appear Hilton and their management employees may have already breached our contract with them. Please keep me advised as 8/27 is upcoming soon and is one of my weeks. Let me know if I can be of service. I may be reached at any time at 954-424-0072 (Fort Lauderdale) ============== Carl William Hillgardner's memo to you is exactly what Annette and I have been \n    complaining about to you for years. We need new Management at OUR Resort, \n    and we need to work on getting control of the entire property at Casa Ybel \n    Resort. I did not buy a \"Hotel\" room, and I did not buy into this very poor, \n    and out of control management. Mr. Hillgardner is painfully correct in stating that it sometimes takes a \n    disaster to have a bad situation come to light. And this information should \n    be shared with all the \"Owners\" of Casa Ybel. Please feel free to share this e-mail with all the Board Members and anyone \n    on the casaybel.com web site. Bob Warren ======= <August 22, 2004> ======= Everyone, This news of Hilton's inappropriate behavior also greatly concerns me. My weeks start 9/17 and I still plan on visiting Sanibel. I posted a comment on the www.news-press.com Sanibel information forum yesterday, and after \n    reading these comments today, I wholeheartedly support my guess. The corporate greed of Hilton is trying to keep us away and possibly over-exaggerate the damage at Casa Ybel in order to make use of the resort and most likely price-gouge guests who will not be able to stay at their planned vacation places because many of them are destroyed. I especially think they may be targeting folks who had planned to come to South Seas. As we can clearly see, reopening there will be delayed for maybe 6 months. It has also occurred to me that Hilton probably also has loss of use insurance, so they may get away with stating that timeshare owners could not use their scheduled weeks, therefore be able to \"double-dip\" insurance and \"hotel accomodations\" for those planning South Seas vacations. Do we have legal representation? If so, how do we get this looked into? I'll help any way I can. Cathy Lanier ============== dear carl, we are so glad that you and your family are well after such a \n    devastating storm. we would like to thank you for keeping us up on the condition of our \n    beautiful casa ybel. as it turns out, jim and i own 185 H, so our corner \n    must have taken a big hit. thanks again, and please keep us up on as much as you can. irene and jim iatridis ============== I just received a call this morning from someone calling for \"HILTON\". The \n    very short and abrupt conversation advised that due to the hurricane no one \n    was being permitted to check in for the week commencing August 23. She \n    clearly stated, \"we don't know what the problems are now\" but no one would \n    be permitted to come in on August 23. A short chat indicated to me that Hilton had absolutely no knowledge what \n    the damage was or even if there was any at all. I told her I saw a \n    helicopter tape from above building H and of Thistle Lodge and the pool area \n    and I told her it looked very good under the circumstances - part of the top \n    floor roof by the dormer had its roof partially blown off. No one was permitted onto Sanibel Island until today, therefore a sight \n    unseen judgment has obviously been made by our management company to shut \n    down until further notice. I have no doubt that conditions will probably merit closure during the \n    stated period but to arbitrarily do it sight unseen seems to lack proper \n    care or judgment for owners and guests. There is a remote chance that Hilton \n    was trying to give as much advance notice as possible but I doubt it. At \n    this juncture, it appears to me to be premature and self-serving. I had \n    already written the week off but felt I must comment on Hiltons manner of \n    operation. ============== understand your concerns, until today no one has any idea of extent of \n    damage....today is the first day that residents are allowed to return to \n    island .....business owners were allowed on island at 11 am today. No \n    tourists or non residents allowed at all. There is a curfew on the island \n    still in effect. to my knowledge...no one...not even Hilton management has \n    any idea regarding damage(if any). I live in Ft. Myers and my electricity was just turned on last evening. \n    Phone still works now and then. Ft. Myers is still on a curfew. There are \n    14,000 power personel working on the power problem. I was suppose to go to a \n    national conference starting today at South Seas...obviously that was \n    cancelled ...though no one has called me...pictures I saw of south seas \n    indicates that it might not be up and running for many many months. I am sure the person who called you today has a lot of other calls to \n    make...it is very hot here...and phones work and then don't work. I am sure \n    the person was trying to do the best they could with owners. Thanks for your \n    inquiry. Joe D'Alessandro ============== My wife and I have been owners at CY since 1987, and currently own three \n    weeks (G203, weeks 2,3,4). Over the years I have become increasingly uneasy \n    about the management of the resort by Hilton Hospitality or whatever local \n    variant of that we have had. Carl has been complaining about things for \n    years, and seems to have been largely ignored. Hurricane Charley has brought \n    to light the inadequacies of the management structure we have. We live most \n    of the year in a development in Bonita Springs. The damage there was much \n    less than CY suffered, but in any case, our property management company was \n    able to respond quickly with repairs to landscaping, arrangements for \n    repairs to buildings, and so on. This may be a good time to get a bit tougher with our management company. \n    They should not be paid for work they are not doing, for management that \n    they are not performing. We need a responsive, flexible management \n    structure, with a lot of local authority, to react to circumstances such as \n    these. I don't see that we are getting that. As just one example, only Carl \n    has been at pains to keep owners informed as to the state of affairs at Casa \n    Ybel. Management does not maintain e-mail listings and e-mail distribution \n    lists, so it can't contact us quickly on matters of concern, even if it \n    wanted to. We need to know as soon as possible what has happened, and what \n    expectations we can have for access to our units at our appointed times. it \n    is time to consider alternate property management, particularly looking \n    toward more local control. Ted and Audrey Brown ============== Short Note to Casa Ybel and other Sanibel/Captiva timeshare owners: Please inform your fellow owners that there is no charge to be included in \n    the e-mail forum for the time share owners. Just e-mail Carl@casaybel.com \n    ask to be included. The listings of rentals and sales provide for the expenses so far. (Update \n    for rentals etc will be placed this week-end, somehow it lost some of its \n    importence at this time) I still get questions: Why was this owners forum not properly announced in \n    our communications from the board? Password for Owner's Forum: sanibel (all lower case) Owner's Forum has not been used for Hurricane Charley info, due to lack of \n    time. It is mostly dated material, and will be edited shortly. Carl ============== Update on Casa Ybel Friday August 20 Just a short note with new info from other owners. Bob Warren suggests http://sanibelrentals.net/forums/viewforum.php?f=1 where updates are given to requesting owners. Janet Wilder, our board member is amongst many mentioning http://www.hgvc.com our own Hilton grand vacation, which has most concerns about units in I, J, and K which seems to have the heaviest losses. and of course http://www.nbc-2.com with the many videos. Our hospitality group, http://www.casaybelresort.com with the good news that there are no damages. Let me broadcast any new sources you might find. E-mail them to me and I will post them. larry.klein@teradyne.com has provided a playback with the nbc video of Casa Ybel (by itself), it has 1743 Kb and is a video file:. \"sanibel damage.WMV.\" It is to large for mass mailing, but perhaps you can contact larry by e-mail and download if you would like a copy. Hope that is Ok Larry, Thanks, it is a good clip. Look at our site for latest inputs: http://www.casaybel.com Have no news from official board, Hilton, and Hospitality at all., will post if I get some. Planning another try this week end to reach Casa Ybel and provide a report with photos. Thank you very much, Carl ============== Thanks, Carl. You're doing a great job. I haven't heard a peep from any of the other parties who should be contacting we owners. Cathy ============== Thanks Carl for all of your hard work in keeping us informed! I am thankful \n    to have you on our side. ============== Dear Mr Appelberg, First I wish to express my sorrow for all that have been affected by \n    Hurricane Charley and for those families that have lost friends and loved \n    ones. I am an owner of week 38 / unit H184 and it amazes me how \n    casaybelresort.com can post such an exaggerated and untrue statement that \n    Casa Ybel is \"intact with no water or wind damage\" when I have seen the \n    video of the resort and have looked straight down into unit H186 and it has \n    no roof over a portion of it as well as the one story units looked as if the \n    roofs had been striped back.. At first I thought it was my unit H184: but \n    none the less, it is obvious that the resort suffered enough damage to make \n    it unusable for a quite a while.. I am sure you are trying to disiminate any \n    information to the owners as soon as you receive, but it is frustrating \n    since I am not getting any answers to my questions and my week is quickly \n    approaching and I need to make alternative plans. Sergio Morales 305-577-7392 ============== Hey Carl, my husband(sportsbe) sent an e-mail to you regarding logistics of \n    Sanibel Cottages and we are out of our home now because of the hurricane. \n    Could you please respond with any info ? Thanks so much. Rebecca ============== Carl, As usual, you are doing a great job at rallying the owners to the realities \n    of Casa. I would like to suggest that you assemble an emergency board \n    meeting (if not now, then when?) to discuss the facts concerning the resort. \n    We need to know when repairs will begin, if we will be assessed special fees \n    for insurance shortfalls (brace yourself), and begin the natural separation \n    from the Hilton people right now. We have a wonderful opportunity to draw the line in the proverbial sand. Get \n    the facts, announce results, offer actions, and seek our support. Above all, \n    WRITE NO CHECKS FOR ANY REASON TO HILTON. This is truly not business as \n    usual. Regards, Milan Milivojevic ======= <August 23, 2004 > ======= Carl William Hillgardner's memo to you is exactly what Annette and I have been \n    complaining about to you for years.

Bob Warren ============== I too am in a bind. I own week 35 which starts next week and also week 38 I \n    am most concerned about Hiltons attitude re: the aftermath of Charley. prior \n    to Charley I could not reach anybody to answer my phone call. We should use \n    this time to get rid of Hilton. limbobb@family-net.org Carl, thank you so much for providing all the up-to-date information on the status of CasaYbel. Up here in Ontario, Canada we only had the news that was being reported on CNN to keep us informed on the status of Charley, and most of it was focused on Punta Gorda which was so badly hit by the storm. I'm sure all the owners appreciate very much all the efforts you put forth to keep us informed Celia Webb Owner, weeks 14 & 15 F151 ============== Carl-- Thank you for all you are doing. One little thing that I have been meaning to suggest--if you could include dates with the messages you post on the website (even the special one you posted today)--both yours and others; that would help greatly in understanding when they are about. --Ralph Silberman ============== Dear Carl. I hope that you and the FGH board will consider using your site as one means of communication with the owners as you begin the huge tasks ahead. Best wishes. Mary Ellen Otto G206 weeks 10/11 ============== Dear Fellow CasaYbel Owners, Go to www.hgvc.com and click on the top left of the page. You will find a \n    summary of the damage assessment to our buildings. I am guessing this site \n    will keep us updated. Janet Wilder ============== Carl, thank you for your report. Please share this with your readers: Dear Fellow Owners- I have been in touch with Lael and she says they (she, EJ and Randy) may not \n    gain access to Sanibel before Wed. or Thurs. at which time they will see the \n    true extent of the damage done by both the wind and water. At present they \n    have seen only the aerial view that shows roof damage, and one unit exposed. \n    The driving rain may have done more but at present they don't know. Lael \n    will be working with Randy (her boss from Orlando), EJ (our regional \n    manager-whose boss is also Randy) and the managers of Hilton-managed Sanibel \n    properties to get mobilized and protected. Randy is having her oversee her \n    former resorts, since her present resorts suffered mostly tree debris, and \n    other than some minor problems, are fine. Thanks to a friend of mine who owns a home on Sanibel I have web sites that \n    will give you a much fuller picture of the scope of the damage, and existing \n    problems. Go to www.news-press.com and www.nbc-2.com and click on everything \n    that says Hurricane, Sanibel, Captiva etc. Only now am I getting a true \n    picture of things-and am delighted to be able to keep abreast of events \n    there. I am sure that as soon as anyone can turn their attention to it the \n    owners will get a full report, but in the meantime there are much more \n    pressing problems to address. In the meantime these web sites may help you \n    gain a sense of things. The 400 yard swath is through North Captiva. See www.news-press.com, click \n    on Hurricane in the News column to the left of the page. When Hurricane \n    Charley Special Report appears scroll through and read whatever interests \n    you. For the specifics on North Captiva, scroll to Setting the Scenes Across \n    Southwest Florida and click on Barrier Islands Bear Brunt of Storm. You \n    might also be interested in North Captiva: Residents get trapped on Island a \n    few more rows down. All I can say from having done as my friend advised, I can see that there \n    will be much work to be done, and many areas will be forever changed. I am \n    as concerned about the vegetation of our beautiful island and resort as I am \n    the structures, and I have no word on that so far. As I learn more I will pass it on to you. Janet Wilder ============== Thanks for your E-mail re damages. We and some relatives have been unable to \n    bring up the aerials but from your description, it appears we've suffered some major \n    damage as we own 2 weeks in H Building Unit 179, to be specific--lower level. We have resisted contacting the Resort Management directly as everyone there \n    must be be in a state of emergency still. Not much we can do from here right now, \n    but wait for more info. Hope someone will give us a summary of the damages and impact on the \n    properties as soon as they can. Keep in touch and thanks for the first report. Jerry Veino ============== Dear Carl I hope you and yours survived this terrible storm, from the few pictures we \n    are receiving here in Toronto Florida looks like a war zone. I understand \n    that Sanibel is still closed but wondered if you had any news on how Casa \n    Ybel stands. We also have weeks up on Captiva and I understand that they took the worst \n    of this storm. Hope everything is OK from your end. Regards Frank ============== Dear Carl, please see this latest official announcement on the status of the island. It \n    is from the website www.mysanibel.com and is run by the City of Sanibel, \n    which has also all kinds of information from the beginning on. \n    Unfortunately, there is nothing specific on Casa Ybel. Maybe you can put this link on your website, so owners can have at least an \n    idea as to how the overall condition on the island is ( e.g. power, water \n    supply street conditions, etc.). Let me thank you for being so kind and giving us information on the island \n    after sthe storm ! I own 6 weeks in Casa Ybel, 4 of them coming up from Oct. 1. I then have 3 \n    weeks in H186 and 188, plus one week in F142. The other weeks are in \n    January, but also in H186. I was glad when I discovered the site www.casaybelresort.com , which of \n    course I thought to be the official site of the resort management ( thanks to you, \n    I know better now !). I was fairly baffled, though, to read that there are \n    no damages to the resort, while the official Sanibel site had stated that 75 \n    % of all the buildings on the island had sustained damages, a lot of them \n    major ones. They listed the badly damaged buildings ( labeled yellow and \n    orange) on their site, and 2255 West Gulf Drive was not among them. So maybe \n    there really has not much happened to Casa Ybel, although it would be a \n    miracle. In your position as the owners' spokes person, maybe you know someone in the \n    city council of Sanibel ? Couldn't they put information on Casa Ybel on \n    their website ? ( I cannot find an email, or I would write to them myself). \n    Since the resort brings a lot of revenue to the island, maybe they will do \n    it. It shows bad management and total disrespect to owners as well as guests on \n    the side of Casa Ybel to leave everyone without ANY information as to when \n    the resort might be open again. I understand that this also depends on the \n    overall status of construction and working utilities on the island, but at \n    least they could say how long it will NOT be working ! Do you know if those immense maintanance fees include insurance ? Hope you have some time for weekend activities and don't get totally \n    immersed in emails from fellow owners ! Regards Dr. Karin Walter-Spiess ============== Carl: When will the website be updated with information defining the condition of \n    the units? John Gebka ============== Mr. Warren: I have been involved with a few different timeshare organizations over the years and many of them have managerial problems. The biggest challenge that the owners face is the lack of control they have over information and the election process. Boards usually get entrenched and by controlling the information flow, they control the election process and managerial function. It is really not much different in the corporate world. Managers get their friends and supporters on the Board by getting them nominated and keeping any opposition blocked out. The list of nominees is released. It contains many people carried forward from the old Board. Some new names appear on the ballot but few owners know much about them while the old names are very well promoted by the continuing Board members and management. It is a very difficult thing to change. If someone wanting to run in opposition asks for a listing of names and addresses of current owners, it is promptly rejected by the in-crowd, usually under the guise of privacy of information. The continuing Board does everything possible to control the process - a little like the old Eastern Europe regimes that finally fell. However, every now and then someone like Carl comes along who really cares about the place. Even then it is rare that a change is made. However, the new age of communication is changing that. If we are able to expand the owner's website list that Carl maintains, it will make a large difference. For example, a slate of concerned owners could be developed and promoted as an alternative to the existing power group. These things take time but they will come. Best wishes-- Lou Morrell ============== Lou I sat on the Board of Directors in our local Chamber of Commerce. You hit it right on the head about people or groups of the that get entrenched do not like things to change. I found that 3 year term to be nothing more than having my name on the Board. They did not like outside ideas, input, or dissenting votes at all. I ended up getting on a committee to saving a park and baseball diamond in our town, and had to take on the Board of the YMCA, Chamber of Commerce, and City Officials. We found that rocking the boat and not following the status quo works real well if you stay the course, and get information out to as many people as possible. We have owned at Casa Ybel for over 20 years, and this problem has been slowly coming to a boiling point.. We see the place as going downhill, and have rented our units 3 of the last 4-5 years, which is not what we really want to do. I think if it was not for many of the efforts by Carl, the place would become a \"Hotel\" type resort instead of an owners timeshare resort. You are right about others finding the casaybel.com web site to interact with other owners, it will help get more \"Rockers\". And I think that owners from that site, that are in agreement on how things are managed at Casa Ybel should make an effort to voice their displeasure at the weekly owners meetings. This would help send a message to the Board, Management, and would also help other owners that are in attendance, become aware of an alternate source of information, when someone brings up about being on the owners list at casaybel.com Bob Warren ============== Dear Carl: Thanks for all your efforts to get information out to us regarding our resort. The video on the roof damage looks bad in IJK. We can only hope that the buildings are structurally sound and repairs will be made as quickly as possible. Any and all updates would be appreciated. We will check your website often. Thanks again, > >Jack Sanok ============== I own unit 176H was to go on the 27th of this month. how much damage did casa ybel get, cannot find information . azambonifan@aol.com thanks arlene ============== Carl, Have you had any photos and damage assessment of the property? If available would you please post for owners to review. Also has anything been mentioned by Hilton Grand Vacations as an offer for other Hilton accommodations on an as available basis to owners that will not be able to vacation in Sanibel this year? ============== And just how would we go about assuming control and/or changing management? \n    Is any of that truly feasible? Scott Sutherland ============== Hi Carl, I've been an owner of 174K, weeks 37 &38 since they were built. Inform all \n    owners on your web site to go to.......www.hgvc.com to get damage updates. \n    As of now CYB is closed for a minimum of 3 months. Hilton told me they will \n    make an announcement next week regarding what they are going to do to \n    compensate owners of weeks during the closed period. Sincerely, Tom Kozlak ============== To the Board of FGH.  It is time we all accepted and supported the \n    website: casaybel.com. this is an informative, easy to use, natural location for \n    owners and people interested in our resort. thanks to this website i have been able to keep up with what is going on at casa ybel. i have yet to hear from any board members. we have no other \n    source where all of us can interact with one another. thank you, irene and jim iatridis, 185H weeks 6 & 7 ======== <August 24, 2004> ========== Dear Janet Wilder Thank you for your response to my email. I am well aware of the friction between Carl and the rest of the Board. Nonetheless, HE is keeping us informed. I checked the HGVC website and found ONE paragraph devoted to Casa Ybel. Compare that to the wealth of info and pictures on Carl's site... the comparison is dramatic. Instead of constantly complaining about Carl's activities, why doesn't the Board change its defensive attitude and find a way to work TOGETHER? As an owner, I am NOT content to leave these matters in the hands of Hilton. The Board should have an emergency meeting and receive a full report on insurance, reconstruction activities, provisions for owners during the affected period, etc. I'm sure all the owners would be happy to reimburse directors for their expenses in attending such a meeting. By the way, I did check the casaybelresort website and found nothing helpful re the damage from Charley. As to CY Hospitality, I don't think any of us original buyers had any clue that some independent group would be controlling our recreational facilities. Unfortunately, I have now learned that this is a typical ploy of Mariner Corp., the original developers. They were also involved in the development where we now live in Port Charlotte, although when Chapter 11 was declared, we found that some fringe group actually controlled the project. Since we now live in Florida only a short distance from Sanibel, we very frequently rent out our weeks. I find it difficult to understand why I should agree to pay a huge percentage to Hilton when I can list my weeks on Carl's website for $35. If we have such a contract, it certainly should be revisited by the Board. I do not intend to shoot the messenger, but I think it is high time to bury the hatchet with Carl and work together for a change. Put your two board attorneys to work after the dust settles and get us on firm legal ground, of course, but PLEASE find a way to resolve these differences. Ed Sealy ================== Carl, As an owner who rented the week of August 13th, I fully expect to get a \n    refund. If I rented from any other resort I would expect and would receive \n    it, I can't see why this would be different. I am sorry to have to ask for \n    it, but I had to make alternate arrangements and do not want to pay twice \n    for my vacation. A renter's and owner's perspective, Mary Ann Maggio ================== Carl, thank you so much for the updates and the pictures. I am sending you a \n    copy of a letter I mailed to Hilton a couple of years ago. It has nothing to \n    do with the \"storm\"....just shows the kind of service I have gotten from \n    Hilton. (2 1/2 years to get a name correct) Again, thanks for all you have done to keep everyone informed. I know you \n    have a thousand other things you need to take care of, but you are \n    appreciated. ================== Carl, I would like to know why we have heard nothing from the board, other than \n    what you have sent out. It has now been over a week since Charley hit and I \n    have not heard one thing from the board. Is it a secret that Charley hit \n    Sanibel & damaged Casa Ybel? Gee, even way up here in Minnesota, we hear \n    news and try to stay current. It does seem odd that those who represent us \n    are silent in a time of disaster. Shellie Specter & Bob Davidson M.R.S. Company G-204, week 12 ================== Carl, People we know have a place in Butterknife and tell us that there are about \n    50 trucks with cherry pickers at Casa ybel and the Casa ybel is housing the \n    workers. Had you heard this? Vance VanDrake ================== Carl Thank you so very much for keeping us up to date on things. I must say \n    that you are really \"on the ball\" and we are very proud of you! Thanks \n    again. We own H182 Week 48 at Casa. Mrs. Marjorie Cast ================== Carl - Sorry, I couldn't delete all of the earlier messages to avoid \n    cluttering your e-mails, but I thought you would be interested to see what \n    my attorney daughter replied to me when I asked for her input about the \n    situation. She, along with my other two daughters, are co-owners of some of \n    my seven units. To the question at hand - what ARE we going to do to protect ourselves from \n    Hilton and those who apparently are satisfied with their \"management\" \n    efforts? Joan Walker F-149 - Weeks 49, 50 and 51 J-163 - Week 1 K-174 - Weeks 2,3 and 4 P.S. I don't know WHAT we would have done without your help and your \n    dedication to trying to keep us informed! It was apparent that you were \n    working deep into the nights to fulfill an obligation you felt that was \n    unique among Board and Management people! THANK YOU, CARL from a very \n    grateful owner! ----- Original Message ----- From: Bostwick, Cynthia To: Joan Walker Sent: Monday, August 23, 2004 9:35 AM Subject: RE: Re: Re: Casa Ybel update 4]] Hi Mom Im sure by the time your weeks come up, this will be straightened out. I \n    havent a clue whats involved in Hiltons contract, so I dont know how to \n    advise on this. I would think if you, as owners, hired them, you, as owners, \n    can fire them, but them who will run it? Love, Cin ================== Hello Carl, I just finished speaking with HGVC about Casa Ybel and their other sites on \n    and off the island. They will not be open until January and will not be \n    placing owners or renters in other HGVC locations. Suggests are if you wish \n    to vacation in the Southwestern part of Florida you are on your own. If you \n    find a rental book it and smile that you will be having a vacation. Linda Milligan Unit 211 weeks 48 & 49 ================== Hi Carl, Just wanted to say thanks for the update....I would know nothing if it \n    weren't for you. It amazes me that I am to arrive at Casa Ybel on Friday and \n    I still have not been notified by anyone not to come. The only information I \n    have received is from you and your website. Thanks again for all your hard \n    work. ================== Concerned Casa Ybel Owners; I am starting to get a funny feeling about the whole operation following the \n    Storm. Where are my fellow board members?? where are the protectors of our \n    investments??? I was somewhat shocked to see the condition of Casa Ybel last Saturday \n    during my visit, by now I have had time to gather my thoughts and have had \n    many funny feelings about the whole matter. As an after thought, this H 184, \n    the worst hit unit, did not seem that catastrophic. (Except for the few roof \n    openings.) I woke up with many strange feelings Sunday morning. Why were E J Nees and Randy (our Hilton operators) so intend of getting away \n    from me when I saw them? and not too willing to answer my simple questions \n    about the clean up? Why did I have a hard time catching up with them and \n    take there picture? I actually had to run to catch up with them, when they \n    saw me, not to friendly. They did not try to approach me and walked away \n    when I asked about the web site info.. Who was the third gentleman involved, and what was his position? All I was \n    told was that he was helping them in the insurance questions. It seemed to \n    be a short visit by them to the site. Who has requested large mobile dry-up \n    air trucks to hook up to our units with long plastic air tubes going in to \n    every unit? Looked like an expensive out of town operation. Who pays? Why \n    not use the air conditioners in the units? When I took photos of the worst damaged unit H 184 the canvas over the \n    opening was in place, and as you can see on the photos, there were no \n    damages to the furniture, just in he walls. The soaked ceilings in the \n    bathroom (see photo) made the light fixture fall out, that was not the case \n    in other units. The carpets were soaking wet, but were drying up. I touched \n    the switch out of habit to improve lighting for the photo, and the ceiling \n    light came on. I then noticed the phone had the red blinker on, indicating a \n    message. I picked it up and had a dial tone right away. I then thought, is \n    the toilet working?, and by golly, I flushed it twice with no problem. Why did Hilton not decide to invite the board before hauling furniture out, \n    see photo, driving furniture away on clean up helps own trucks.? We had electric power, phones working, and water pressure in the pipes, why \n    not use the air conditioners to dry the units out? Are we into a Hilton decision to make an insurance claim to gut the units \n    and make the owners pay $100.000 to refurbish with brand new products to \n    make a never unit for rental purposes? They do not care about lost time by \n    owners not using their units. On second thought, this is a drastic decision. \n    I am just wondering, why all this secrecy? The Board should stop what they are doing, make a trip to Casa Ybel, stop \n    whatever they are doing and look at the damage. We are talking about \n    millions of $$$$. Does a leaky roof warrant a gutting of the whole resort????? Furniture and \n    all? All units were open and had free access, and I was never questioned by \n    anyone about my presence. No one seemed to be in charge, I asked around, but no one could speak \n    english. My home outside Ft Myers had damages, my insurance company called me two \n    days after the storm, and on the fifth day I had a check issued in my drive \n    way by a Texan adjuster to rebuild my pool cage. We do not even know what our insurance covers almost 2 weeks after the \n    storm. I suggest concerned owners sign up to form a forum to donate skills in \n    concerned areas, and get a lawyer involved in order to protect our millions \n    of dollars in the Casa Ybel investment. This web site will be donated for this communication that is resisted by the \n    elected board. I will like for owners to choose a spokesman and a board for \n    communication. I will be happy to keep the communication going and let this \n    spokesman take over as an editor. This will clear the way for the elected board to agree without my presence.. Respectfully Carl J. Appelberg ================== Not to sure about this guy Carl, but it is most interesting that we're not \n    hearing anything from our management company. Not to difficult to provide \n    updates on their website, I would think. Wish they were as competent as our previous management, who continue to \n    manage South Seas Plantation on Captiva. We had a nice letter from them, \n    apologizing for having to cancel our reservations for October, due to the \n    storm. However, they encouraged we come back after they reopen in December. \n    Imagine that, we didn't even have to ask for the cancellation. Talk to you later, Dad ================== Hi Carl, thanks for all that information you gave and that you take care on our \n    interests and our units. I am a German owner and unfortunately I cannot say so much about the \n    contracts we have with HGV and the roles and responsiblities regarding that \n    points. But in case of doubt I would support your suggestion to involve a \n    lawyer in order to cover our interests. (Assumed I got your point already). It's not that I will not have a 100% reconditioning on my unit. Of course I like a 100% reconditioning, but it should be done, where neccesary and needed. I fully agree, we should not burn our money. Many regards Mario Schubert ================== Dear Ms. Dettery, as a concerned owner of two units (I-161 and 162, week 47) \n    at Casa Ybel, could you please respond to all the various emails and \n    condition reports regarding our resort and the seriousness of the damage. Is \n    there a set time as to when the board will release statements of condition \n    and our rights of timeshare owners (our loss potential) and the \n    process/action plan Hilton has in store and Hospitality figures into this? \n    This assessment is desperately needed by all concerned parties! Thank you for your immediate attention in this matter! Cindy King The Kings Jim, Cindy, Matthew & Kevin ================== Carl - FYI, I sent this letter to Janet and Joe, as well as to Linda.

I own week 35 H187 Right next to H186 \n    supposably the hardest hit Unit. I haven't heard anything from management \n    about what condition the unit is in or anything for that matter. Hilton only \n    called to inform me not to come. With plane tickets bought months ago and car reserved we have decided to \n    come to Florida to vacation. We had to find a place to stay of coarse. \n    Trying to find a 2 bedroom condo for rent for that week was not easy and now \n    I have to pay out of pocket to stay in one. Let me tell you they are NOT \n    CHEAP to rent as you well know.! Will I be reimbursed for this cost? My son who is leaving for college is coming with us with great hopes of \n    staying at CasaYbel. He has only been there one time before but loved it. He \n    was somewhat disappointed in our having to stay at another place. Melanie Sprain ================== Dear Mr. Appelberg, Thank you so much for communicating with us, the OWNERS of Casa Ybel Resort. \n    I don't know what we would do without you. We have not had a single \n    communication from Hilton Grand Vacations, our Board members, or the Resort Management. Who is Hospitality? Didn't know there was a hotel there! We are owners at both CasaYbel and Sanibel Cottages and are never sure who \n    to contact when we need to communicate with the RESORT. I wish someone will \n    explain to us who is in charge of what. We are actually very confused as to who runs \n    the show - at the moment it seems like nobody. What happened to the Board we \n    elected to run OUR PROPERTY, OUR INVESTMENT? Why are they not holding open meetings \n    on site for all members to attend? Did they all take off for Rio?? In the case at hand - the storm - we would certainly go along with setting \n    up a forum and donate skills as well as get a lawyer to protect our investment, \n    and for choosing a spokesman - all within the next 24 hours. We are happy for Carl Appelberg to take charge. We suggest an immediate Court Order prohibiting the removal of any of our furniture, etc, without a Court-approved signature \n    - and with the Sanibel police at the gate to enforce it. Unfortunately, since we are far away from the action (we live in France) we \n    are unable to be there in person or donate any assistance, but sure appreciate \n    being kept informed and protected from rip-off artists! We do not begin to understand why our elected board is not on site to do \n    their job and represent our interests. We are copying them on this e-mail and hope to \n    hear officially from our resort as to the actual conditions there, how we OWNERS \n    are affected, etc. etc. If they are talking about 3 months repairs (which is not \n    we understand from your on-the-spot photos of working lights, phones, airconditioning, etc), our ownership is certainly within that period - Week \n    41, October 8. Thanks again, Mr. Appelberg. Concerned owners: Brian & Hala Hunt ================== Carl, How can we express our gratitude for all you do to keep us informed. It is most appreciated!! I too remember something about insurance covering lose of rental income. Our premiums even went up (included in our maintenance fees) of $300 to over $600 now with excluding the pools diving board, slide, etc. Paying more for less. We are in favor of getting an attorney as well as notifying the State Insurance Commission if necessary, for possible insurance fraud. How else would you explain the management trying to avoid you. (They have something to hide). Much of the units were just recently done over, drying should be tried first before throwing out stuff that works..I hope by now you have heard from other board members and that they are in agreement with the procedure to even notify the newspapers and bringing it to the authorities attention. Our unit is for October, by then it should be available to us, if its just a matter of drying out the place and cleaning up the mold. Will they be letting \"Owners\" in as the units become available? Why are we being told we can't come on the Island when we are \"owners\" and pay FL taxes on these units? Let us know what we can do to bring these concerns to light and how to get action quickly so at least, some of us, can use our units this year, if not all but the severly damaged. If its not 100% perfect, and not a health hazard, hopefully the owners will understand and extend grace, as long as the long term goal is to bring the grounds and property back to its original state. As long as we see management trying and working hard for our interests, it just might work. But if there is a scandle involved and mismanagement of monies, insurance fraud, etc. we are in favor of punishing the \"criminals\". For some of us, this is the only vacation we get in a year. So to miss out on it would not be so \"ho hum\". As far as cleaning up trees, etc., nature has a way of \"airing out\" dense foilage, hopefully it will come back in time for us to enjoy once again! Please feel free to pass this email along to anyone who might be interested in furthering our cause to get us up and running efficiently, economically, smoothly and honestly. Warm regards, Rich & Sunny Simone, VA ================== Now, here's an interesting comment from my daughter! \"I just thought of one good thing that may come out of Hurricane Charley - \n    new mattresses that the sheets actually fit? \" Continued thanks - Jill ================== Carl, I found your name on a website as someone who could possibly give me some \n    good and accurate information on the status of Casa Ybel and Thistle Lodge. \n    We have a wedding scheduled there and are understandably concerned about the \n    damage sustained and whether we need to make alternate plans. Thanks for any help you are able to give. ================== Carl: I have been in the water damage mitigation business for over 13 years, and \n    can assure you that air conditioning will NOT dry wet structural materials \n    in anywhere close to an acceptable time frame. Simply looking at or touching \n    structural materials will not tell you how \"wet\" they are. A person's \n    fingers normally would test 22%-24% Moisture Content on a penetrating meter, \n    which is enough moisture to cause rot in wood and mold in drywall. A variety of instruments are available for testing wood, drywall, and \n    subsurface materials, including penetrating/non-penetrating meters, thermal \n    imaging cameras, and infrared temperture sensors. All have their place in \n    the science of structural drying. You can do a Google.com search for \"structural drying\" , IICRC.org \n    (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning, & Restoration Certification) which is \n    the industry certification organization which has established standards for \n    drying wet buildings (S500 standard) and for mold remediation (S520 \n    Standard), or to: http://www.restcon.com/links/articles/mold_prevention_and_control.html, \n    the web site for Restoration Consultants, or a number of other sites I could \n    provide, which can give you information on drying structures. Depending upon WHEN these \"dry-up air trucks\" to which you refer, actually \n    started drying, there may be little mold damage if they have been able to \n    control the envrionment within the building. If these machines are propane \n    powered, they are probably Water-Out trailers, for which only a small amount \n    of electrical power is necessary to power the air moving equipment (a small \n    generator would suffice). If they are powered by large generators, they are \n    probably dessicant dehumidifiers, which will dry the structure a little \n    slower. Both will dry structural materials deep within the structure in a \n    matter of days. If electrical power was limited when this equipment was \n    installed, it was probably the best choice, since generators to power Low \n    Grain refrigerant dehumidification would have been a problem because of the \n    number of extension cords which would have been needed unless there was a \n    good sized generator (perhaps 100kw) for each building. Insurance companies pay for rapid, complete drying, and in some (but not \n    all) cases, mold remediation. On the Restoration Consultants website, you \n    will find that it is recommended that a qualified Industrial Hygienist \n    determine the extent of mold involvement when \"visible mold is present on \n    materials\". Attempting to \"dry with air conditioning\" would surely result in \n    a MUCH greater loss because of mold remediation. I recommend that an \n    Industrial Hygienis/Indoor Air Quality professional take samples from wall \n    cavities in areas which are suspect because of surface mold to determine the \n    amount/type of mold present, and then provide a protocol on how the mold \n    remediation (IF any) should be done. Post cleaning testing should be \n    included, so we know that the affected areas have been cleared of \n    unacceptable levels of mold. This work should be done by professionals who \n    can show that they have mold/pollution liability insurance, since General \n    Liability Insurance does NOT provide ! this coverage. It is VERY expensive, and is not available to all contractors \n    who do this work. Certificates of Insurance should be provided and Casa Ybel \n    should be named as an \"additional insured\". Do we know that the furnishings were taken away to be disposed of, or were \n    some of them moved for cleaning/storage? Soft goods which had been wet by \n    water coming through building materials would likely be considered to be \n    contaminated, and replacement should be covered by insurance. Case goods \n    (tables, etc.)which are not particleboard core construction, may well be \n    salvageable. I would guess that IF we have adequate insurance on the structure and \n    contents, a $100K deductible will not be too unmanageable, since we should \n    have reserves for many things which are now going to be replaced by \n    insurance, which means that those reserves (roofs, painting, \n    furniture,carpeting, sliding glass doors, and perhaps some appliances) will \n    now not be used as quickly as they were scheduled to be used, which should \n    leave some surplus reserve funding which could be tapped for meeting some of \n    our deductible. If our policy provides for bringing the building up to \n    current code, we should benefit since the newer hurricane rated \n    windows/sliding doors would have to be installed. If we don't have adequate insurance (such as contents not being covered, \n    mold from a current water damage, etc.), we need to know why not. Surely a \n    policy exists and we should be able to see it. If our property is covered \n    under some master policy, and we don't know what our coverages are, legal \n    representation might be in order. I would urge the Board not to engage a \n    Public Adjustor, since the time to make these repairs would be increased by \n    a magnitude of several times, and we might not have enough money left to do \n    the necessary work. A P.A. should only be considered if we are getting \n    nowhere in determining what coverage we have. We should make certain that all work is done by proper contractors, and not \n    necessarily by those chosen by Hilton, who may not have our best interests \n    at heart, and may be looking to make up lost revenues by saving money on \n    repairs. Please keep us informed of the progress you make in getting some of these \n    answers. Sincerely, G. Carl Plaskett ================== Carl: I wanted you to see this response to my note below. I sent this message in the request box on their web-site. This response and the current instructions for \"timeshare\" owners on their web site indicates to me that this organization (?company?) has NO interest in the interval owners. Does this not constitute a violation of any contract the owners may have with that company? I would like you to make this response known to the other Board Members. Paul L.

I \n    asked about Hurricane House and Casa Ybel. He first said it would be several \n    weeks to several months before everything was restored. There was \n    significant water damage, needing to replace all furniture, etc. He said \n    they basically had no options for us as Owners. If we were Club Members \n    (which is a different program) they may have some options available at other \n    resorts or redepositing the week. He also explained that it was a natural \n    disaster which I understand. He also stated because it was hurricane season \n    that is why the weeks we purchased were low. We had traded a week we had at Marriott Grand Vista in Orlando through \n    Interval International for Hurricane House week 38. We are owners of Week 39 \n    189H at Casa Ybel. Thanks for your assistance and information. Karla Kreitner ================== Dear Carl, I just thought I'd put in my 2 cents. I understand your concerns, but in \n    terms of repairing instead of gutting, I would have to go with gutting. I \n    was flooded out during a storm and water damage is a very hard thing to \n    correct. My insurance company immediately had a restoration company come in \n    and gut the basement, spray disinfectant and place power fans all over. It \n    is very important to get rid of anything that has been saturated and get rid \n    of all moisture, because mold will grow very quickly and it is nearly \n    impossible to get rid of once it starts to grow in the walls (plus mold can \n    be very harmful to the respiratory system). If the walls have been soaked \n    they should be torn out, not replaced. The last thing you want is to repair \n    at a significant cost just to have the units smelling of mildew in a few \n    weeks or months. The air conditioners are not capable of drying the way \n    those power fans do, the longer it takes to dry the faster the mold & mildew \n    grow. In the long run it would be better to have new units for a higher \n    cost, then fixed units that might start growing mold & mildew and smell. I own at Cypress Pointe and all the units were completely renovated (only \n    the dining room table stayed) for a cost of $600 to each owner, and that did \n    not include any insurance payment. $100,000 is a lot of money, but consider \n    it will be split among all the unit weeks. If there are 74 units * 52 \n    (weeks), then there are 3,848 weeks that will absorb the $100,000. That \n    means that each week will have to pay $26 to cover the $100,000. Trish ================== I have not heard a word from Hilton on Casa Ybel. I was scheduled to arrive \n    for my vacation the Friday after Charlie. Hilton is a large organization and \n    should have had much better communication with its guest and the owners of \n    the units, which I am one. Disappointing. Robert Baker ================== Carl, I am attaching a copy of an email I attempted to send this morning to \n    those web addresses you had forwarded to me from your website. Many of them \n    have been returned to me as undeliverable, for reasons I don't understand. \n    You indicated to me over the phone that if I wanted to address the \n    situation, you would put my response on your website verbatim, with no \n    editing or eliminations. Even though I have not been able to reach these \n    owners, they can apparently get through to your website, so I am asking you \n    to put my entire email on your website for their edification. Thank you for \n    your assistance. Linda << Update \n    on Casa Ybel.rtf >> Linda R. Dettery Area Counsel (SB/SE) (917)421-4737 ======== <August 26, 2004> ========== Carl, Thank you for your willingness to step up and provide the owners with initial damage reports and for pushing to get a line of communication open. The \"squeaky wheel\" theory once again prevails. Now that the initial shock and dismay has had a chance to wear off it is time for the Board of Directors and the GHV team to step up, exercise their authority, provide leadership, make sound decision, communicate their plan to restore the property, restore our investments, insure that the future of those investments are sound, environmentally safe, and provide many years of quality service and use. This will require \"full time\" commitment from the Board Members with a lot of \"on site\" eyes and ears time. We have put our trust in their ability and willingness to be our agents. If there are any Board Members that cannot commit to this level of involvement in the foreseeable future they need to step forward and ask to be replaced. We do not need to find out about their inability's and failures 6 months down the road when the new paint and fixtures begin to have problems. My expectations are known. My vote for and my trust in the Board of Directors remains. They have a rough road ahead of them, give them room to work and excel. Failure is NOT an option. ================== Carl: Thanks for all of your informative emails. You are what the owners \n    need since you are within a reasonable distance to Casa Y'bel and like \n    others I'm in another state (Oklahoma). That is one way I select who I vote \n    for on the board (how far away will the board be in case of an emergency \n    like Charley). I will support your web site and will support your efforts to \n    disclosure - owners have the right to know. Keep up the good work - it is appreciated! Rebecca Griffin I-Week 30 ================== Carl. I still think you did the right thing by trying to tell the owners \n    exactly what was going on. As for you being a parnoid personality - \n    NEVER!!!!! I think a lot of owners the same way I do. Why wouldn't you be given any \n    information since you are on the board? As to your web site, I am glad - and I am sure that many other owners - that \n    we have it. I, too, think Hilton should start letting us know what is going on. Funny \n    you cant get the name of the insurance company, isn't it? Carl, keep up the good work. I know there are a lot of people behing you. Margie Cast ================== Hi there. My name is Chris Hurley. My Wife (Kim Nicley) an I own weeks 21 \n    and 22 in G 214. I have served on many boards in the past and I must say \n    that I feel for you and your enormous burden following hurricane Charley. I am a principle in an HVAC contracting company. I also hold a master \n    electricians license. We have done quite a bit of insurance renovation. I am \n    quite familiar with mold remediation and water damage. I am located in Knoxville, Tennessee and would be happy to assist in any way \n    you need. (I also have an airplane). Let me know if I can help, either in person or by e-mail. Thanks for all of your efforts, I appreciate them. Chris Hurley ================== Dear Board, I am an owner of unit 211 weeks 48 and 49 plus I rent unit 217 week 48. I \n    live in New Jersey. I have gotten conflicting information from HGVC and NO \n    communication from the board except for Carl's web-site. ( And in the mist \n    of any storm one is thankful for any port that offers refuge. So I am \n    publicly thanking Carl at his attempt to let owners now the state of \n    Sanibel. He listed useful links.) However, only HGVC and the full board can give me accurate information, \n    please do so. The HGVC site says the units will be operational in 3 months, the office \n    tells me January. What am I to do with the 8 airline tickets I purchased \n    prior to Charlie? Do I plan to go to Sanibel as planned, hold my breath that \n    maybe I will have a place for everyone. Or do I go ahead and find something \n    off the island? Of course if the rental is available in Dec. I won't get my \n    money back for that and I will be out even more money. It is clear we all love Sanibel and we are all overly emotional since the \n    hurricane but owners need to know what the heck is going on. I asked HGVC if they would relocate owners into units at other resorts as \n    they open and was told NO. When I asked if they would try to help us find \n    other lodging on the island in other resorts that are not run by HGVC I was \n    told NO. When I asked if they would place us in HGVC resorts off island I \n    was told NO. I then restated what they told me, as basically I am on my own. \n    They said yes. Would the board please say something to owners so we at least know what is \n    really happening date wise. Is it really 3 months or is it Jan or is it even \n    later? Thank you and I hope to hear from someone. Linda Milligan. ================== Linda The information that you supplied is appreciated. I would like to say the probably a majority of the 2-3000 timeshare owners \n    have a computer, and the Owners should make it a point, that the Board make \n    available some forum were the owners have the opportunity to, if the want, \n    to communicate with each other and the Board. Be it a formal or informal \n    forum, since the web site run by Hospitality is not owner friendly. I would also ask that the owners be informed as to what kind of non-use \n    insurance will benefit Hilton, and why the owners do not have such \n    insurance.And if we did have it at one time, why was it dropped. I am in the \n    situation were I am probably going to have to refund money to my renters, \n    which was money that I used to rent at a different location this year. I will not speak for any other owners, but I am sure there are some that \n    feel the way I do about the way Hilton has been managing their duties, or \n    lack of, at our resort. I would like to see them replaced with someone that has more of an interest \n    in the owners, than in their own vacation group. Bob Warren Owner G221 ================== Hello Carl, I just finished speaking with HGVC about Casa Ybel and their other sites on \n    and off the island. They will not be open until January and will not be \n    placing owners or renters in other HGVC locations. Suggests are if you wish \n    to vacation in the Southwestern part of Florida you are on your own. If you \n    find a rental book it and smile that you will be having a vacation. Linda Milligan Unit 211 weeks 48 & 49 ================== Carl - We own weeks 44 &45 at Casa Ybel. We really appreciate all you are doing to \n    keep the owners informed. Some of the e-mails you are receiving are quite \n    outrageous, so we were happy to see the letter from Linda Dettery. I tried \n    to use the e-mail address on your website to send her a note of thanks and \n    encouragement, but it was returned as undeliverable. Do you have a different \n    e-mail address for her? Also, please add us to your e-mail list for updates on the resort. \n    dolphnancy1@mchsi.com Thank you. Nancy and Dolph Neubauer ================== Dear Carl,. I am owner of week 34, 165J, and was wondering what password I need to access the owners only area of the website. I am suppossed to be at my unit this week and since I am local, I'm considering just driving over today after work and see for myself. I have never been happy w/this management group and B.S. and don't trust them a bit. I just looked at the pictures of the \"new view from Thistle Lodge\" and it all made sense about the slide which infuriated my family when it was removed with no notification to the owners. They seem to forget they work for us. We own the property, not them. It is our investment. And now its our lost use of our property., We deserve better information and answers. You can reach me at Kerry50@comcast.net or Kerry.Horne@Wachovia.com. thanks for your work. You have alot of support. ================== Hi Carl: Thank you for doing your best to keep us up to date on Casa Ybel. Darragh Weisman, owner ================== Carl, Best note of your series, Carl. Thank you. Tom Boyle, Atlanta ================== Good morning Carl. Appreciate your letter and valuable background information. I am an owner as stated yesterday and many miles away here in Canada. Have found a very lofty attitude from management in the past and the board \n    representing us is our main force acting on our behalf. I suggest there be a firm letter sent to management (written by a lawyer) \n    stating that we have specific expectations. The role of management must have to meet certain specified standards and if \n    they are delinquent then we should act accordingly. I do not know what that means other than either we get satisfaction that we \n    are being treated properly or there will be negative implications for the \n    management and they have to be made aware we are serious in these endeavours. I would pay my fair share for such legal representation. In the interim managagement should know we are scoring them (for future \n    reference) based on their handling of this recent matter. Keep up the good work. P.S. The Tuesday sessions (forum) should have a secretary who notes the \n    undertakings of the management group who attend. There should be a sign off that whatever will be undertaken and a written \n    reponse when it is completed(with a time line) for the files. Hell! This is not rocket science! It is a business and lets run it accordingly. Again, thanks Carl. John and Kath Callaghan. ======== <August 27, 2004> ========== Carl, Do the by-laws have language concerning emergencies and assembly of the \n    board in response to the \"protection of persons or property\"? If you can \n    read some of the fine print in the rules, perhaps you can compel a meeting \n    by the board. Alternately, can the property owners compel a meeting of the \n    board via some kind of action? Please dig into this and I will be glad to \n    compose the necessary \"call to action\". Find some language that we can use \n    to get the proverbial rears in gear. Milan Milivojevic ================== Carl, I appreciate all you have been doing to inform owners of the resorts status. \n    We are relatively new owners purchasing three weeks from your website 5 \n    years ago. I feel as though the owners of the weeks affected by the \n    hurricane should either have their maintenance fee waived next year or be \n    put up somewhere else. My parents and my family always look forward to the \n    peace and quite of Sanibel every year. I worry that for many of us every \n    year missed is a year wasted as the kids are getting too old to pull out of \n    school and my parents are getting older. This was important time for the \n    grandparents to spend with the grandkids. This may have been our last year \n    to stay the entire three weeks. This is something that a price tag cannot be \n    put on. Doesn't insurance cover at least loss of rental income??? Thanks for all your hard work. I check your website everyday for any new \n    developments. I did feel that the units were salvagable and could have been \n    fixed by Week 38 when we were scheduled to leave. Sincerely, Sheryl and Paul Favorite-G203 weeks 39 and 40 Carol and John Deindoerfer G203 week 38 (my parents) ================== Carl: I have been an owner at CasaYbel since 1980. I now there have been \n    problems and plenty of them and I also know that the last 4 or 5 years have \n    been far superior to the preceeding years because HGVC and hospitality have \n    been working together. Personally I t think that Hospitality is more of a \n    taker than a giver, but they also own their business and arre entitled to \n    try to make it profitable We have the choice of tolerating those things that \n    they are unwilling to change or selling out and going elsewhere. I'm \n    staying. As for HGVC, I think they are doing an excellent job. It looks like a lot of \n    you correspondents don't know the difference between hospitality and HGVC \n    and blame Hilton when they should be blaming hospitality. As for the profit \n    motive, if there were no profit, there would no services. I feel really sorry for all owners, especially the ones who have units \n    between now and February or March. But, guys and gals, if you haven't a \n    catagory 4 hit Florida's southwest coast. There are thousands of homes \n    destroyed, thousands of homeless people and extensive damage to CasaYbel. \n    There is not a living person who could predict whether repairs will be done \n    by December 1 or January 15. Doesn't matter whose on the board, who is \n    managing the units, the critical issue is finding enough contractors and \n    crew who are able to get in and get the job done. Everybody is losing while \n    the resort is closed. So dnn't get mad and write insulting comments, \n    especially if you are right that HGVC and Hospitality are only interested in \n    the money. Lynn Perkins, Weeks 17 and 18. ======== <September 3, 2004> ========== Carl Thanks for everything you have been doing. Many of us are very grateful that \n    you are an OWNERS, Board Member. If I wanted to have a recall vote of a Board Member/Members, I believe that \n    I have to ask a Board Member to supply me with a list of all the owners, and \n    what my intent is. Then the Board must supply me, or anyone else that may \n    have this intent, with the name and addresses of all the owners. I believe this is Florida Law, not any By Law. There may be owners that know \n    more about this than me, so please post this on the Casa Ybel Owners Board \n    if you would, so that we may get some open discussion on this matter. Thank you Bob Warren Owner 221G 40 & 41 Top of Page E-Mail: Carl@CasaYbel.com Carl Appelberg 2213 Colefax Court Westminster C.C. Lehigh Acres FL 33971 239-368-6354 Back to Casa Ybel Home Page."
