      "text": "Popular restaurant in Satellite Beach gets new lease, and new opportunity News Space Sports Opinions Restaurants Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals DINING Beachside restaurant owners turn initial fear about displacement into new opportunity Amber Olesen Florida Today AI-assisted summary Facing the sale of their building, the owners of Morning Glory Eatery and Pappagallo's Pizza secured a two-year lease extension, potentially longer. The family purchased a former Beef O’ Brady’s and plan to open a new restaurant, Tailgaters, in Summer 2025. The original restaurants, Pappagallo's Pizza and Morning Glory Eatery, remain open at their current location. When the owners of Pappagallo’s Pizza and Morning Glory Eatery found out the beachside building housing their restaurants was being sold, their initial reaction: panic. Especially since Dave Rich, along with his wife, Tricia, and son, Nik, had secured a third leased space in the same Satellite Beach plaza for a new gelato shop . Rich tried to purchase the building, on the eastside of State Road A1A, but he said the previous owner opted for a quick all-cash sale. With more than 60 employees and a deep-rooted history in the beachside community, Rich and his family scrambled to find another location to keep Pappagallos alive. It just so happened that a property not too far away, located at 724 S. Patrick Drive, had come on the market as a once-popular sports bar and restaurant, part of a national chain, was closing after 18 years in business. That was the former Beef O'Brady's building, which Rich quickly bought with plans to relocate Pappagallo's. Then things changed again allowing Pappagallo's and Rich's other two establishments to stay where they are, and opening the door to a fourth business for the Rich family. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. Rich was able to secure a two-year agreement to stay at the original location, with the option of perhaps additional time. Rich said they will stay in the plaza for as long as they can or until it is demolished and potentially replaced with condominiums. Brevard gets a Trader Joe's: Will it rival ALDI's popularity? Top trivia nights: Where to play and win in Brevard County Last chance: Longtime Cocoa favorite restaurant to shut down after 45 years Best bar in Brevard? Believe the hype. This downtown Melbourne staple deserves the honor. And now, they have a new concept joining the family portfolio of beachside enterprises: Tailgaters Restaurant, which will open at the former Beef O'Brady's property this summer. “There’s a silver lining to it all. The amount of community support we have received is overwhelming,\" Rich said. \"We have second generation kids that work here. Their parents worked here. We’ve been here for so long.” What’s planned for the former Beef O'Brady's site? That building is currently under renovation. Rich plans to demolish the kitchen and expand, invest in all new equipment and furnishings, keeping only the original exhaust. “It will be totally different. Guests won’t recognize it, for sure. Everything is going to be new and redone,” he said. And when it reopens, it will be Tailgaters, offering breakfast and lunch for a few months while they find their footing. Then it will expand into dinner hours. Opening is planned for this summer. Wait, what about the gelato? Currently in their soft opening phase, Beaches and Cream is open at 1773 State Road A1A, from 3 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., next door to Pappagallo's. A true family affair, like all their restaurants, Rich's wife and son assist him in handmaking the gelato and sorbets. Expanding beyond traditional vanilla and chocolate, Nik, renowned for his bartending expertise, crafted a \"signature margarita flavor\" featuring hints of mango, lime, and basil. And if Beaches and Cream happens to be closed, stop into Pappagallo's and ask if they have any gelato to grab and go. Morning Glory Eatery and Pappagallo’s Pizza Pappagallo's Pizza has been in Satellite Beach at 1769 State Road A1A, since 1990. Rich and family took over ownership in 2008. They make their own bread and pizza dough, offer indoor and outdoor seating, with views of the ocean and have a killer catch phrase: Legalize Marinara. The Riches have owned Morning Glory Eatery in the same complex, which previously housed Sun on the Beach, since 2019, following a complete remodel. Whether guests choose the crab benedict or the son of a biscuit — there's a bright dining room or a sweet outdoor deck with a view and a breeze waiting.
