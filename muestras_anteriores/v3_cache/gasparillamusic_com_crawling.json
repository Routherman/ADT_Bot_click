After careful consideration and many difficult conversations, we have decided to postpone this year’s February date due to the ongoing financial strain caused by two consecutive years of extreme weather conditions that were beyond our control. This decision was not made lightly, as we understand the immense impact this has on our community, the artists, our GMF staff, and the many individuals who look forward to GMF each year. However, in an effort to preserve the long-term health of our nonprofit foundation and ensure that we can continue to provide a vibrant and meaningful cultural experience in the years ahead, we believe this is the best course of action. The challenges of the past two years have put a tremendous financial strain on our Foundation, and by choosing to recoup our losses now, we aim to protect our ability to produce a high-quality event that you and our community can be proud of. We are committed to using this time to re-evaluate, recover, and begin planning for our next exciting and successful festival. We want to express our deep appreciation for the unwavering support the City of Tampa and surrounding Tampa Bay community has shown us throughout the years. Your dedication to GMF means the world to us, and we remain grateful for the opportunity to bring people together to celebrate the love of music. We’ve already begun processing ticket refunds, and you we hope to have those completed in the next 7-14 days. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you once again for the tremendous continued support. We look forward to brighter days ahead and to coming together for the next spectacular Gasparilla Music Festival in the near future.
