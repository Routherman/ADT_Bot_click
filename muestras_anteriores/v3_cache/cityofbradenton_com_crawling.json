While providing for the overall health, safety, and welfare of the community, the City's Code Enforcement officers’ focus is to assist all citizens with maintaining a world class quality of life in Bradenton. The easiest way to report a possible code violation is by calling the Code Enforcement Coordinator at 941-932-9485. You can also send an email to codeenforcement@bradentonfl.gov Please provide the address of the violation. This makes it a lot easier for us and saves everyone time. PLEASE NOTE: The Governor has signed HB 60 and its corresponding Senate Bill into law, and effective July 1, 2021, our Code Enforcement officers are no longer allowed to investigate anonymous complaints. An individual complaining about a potential code violation has to provide their name and address. We will document that information in our records, after which it becomes subject to public records laws. The only exception is if we have reason to believe that the violation presents an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare or imminent destruction of habitat or sensitive resources. If an individual is unwilling to provide this information, we will politely advise that state law prohibits us from investigating the complaint. We generally do not call you back with an update. Code enforcement is a legal process, so it may take some time before you see results. Our officers' first priority is to help residents achieve code compliance. We recommend that you contact the code enforcement officer who handles your case if you are unsure what to do or if you have questions. His/her phone number should be listed on the document you have received from Code Enforcement. Please do not ignore any notices our code enforcement officer has sent or given to you. The City utilizes a Special Magistrate and the citation process to address code violations. Non-compliance could result in fines and/or citations. Meetings with the Special Magistrate are held the first Tuesday of the Month at 9 a.m. in the City Hall Council Chambers.

Originally known as Hewmac Investment Services, Bill McTavish opened his own GIC brokerage in 1984 after working for various life insurance, banks & trust companies for 20+ years. His daughter and now financial advisor, Juliane Goyette, spent her after-school hours and summers working in the family business helping Bill meet his clients needs. In 1995, Bill recognized the changing landscape of the investment industry and saw the opportunity to provide his clients more solutions to help them achieve their financial objectives. He opened his own mutual fund dealership in Newmarket, Ontario providing administrative and compliance support to more than 50 advisors while he continued to work closely with his clients. At this time, his daughter Juliane had graduated from university and was now working in the family business full-time. At this time, after almost 20 years of working with various mutual funds companies, Brian Lavoie decided to join Bill and Juliane as an independent financial advisor. Since 2018, Bill McTavish has worked toward retirement and Juliane Goyette & Brian Lavoie have continued his legacy of providing the highest level of service to their clients and working to build their financial security.

The 500-space garage has an eye-catching colorful motif all around and has a Bradenton-specific mosaic on the north side. The six-foot high, 15-panel, 120-foot-long mosaic, called \"The Magic River\", was created by Pittsburgh artist James Simon, who came to our area and learned what it is that most defines us as Bradenton residents. The resulting mosaic contains panels that reflect the Manatee River, the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Bradenton Farmer's Market and many other aspects of our lives here. The Judicial Center Parking Garage at 615 12th St. West is incredibly beautiful as well. We are proud that a necessary function - parking in our downtown area - can be so lovely.

What are the Building Department hours of operation? Who can tell me what I am allowed to build on my property? Prior to new construction or additions, it is best to contact the Planning and Zoning Department at 941-932-9414. As a homeowner, can I apply for my own building permit? Yes, if you are competent to perform the work and if you meet the owner/builder exemption. You will be required to read, understand and certify compliance through the completion of the Owner/Builder Affidavit. (To obtain a copy of this form, please send an email to Permitting@bradentonfl.gov .)  Warning: If you are allowed the exemption, you take all the responsibilities and liabilities as a contractor. What do I need in order to apply for a permit? Visit our Forms & Applications page for required documents or call 941-932-9414. Can I apply for a permit online? Permits are applied for online through our Building and Permitting Division webpage. How much does a permit cost? The cost varies based on the permit type. The Fee Schedule has all the information you need. Please contact Permitting@bradentonfl.gov for a copy of the Fee Schedule. What are the most important factors in hiring a contractor? It is important to know if the contractor has a valid License/Certificate of Competency, if he/she can provide recent references, or if the contractor has expired permits. Other important information you should also know: You can check with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation for complaints against a contractor's license. Use a contractor that will fulfill their contract and return after completion of the job for warranty issues. Compliance with the Code is ultimately the responsibility of the property owner. Be sure that all inspections have been approved and that you are satisfied with the work before making final payment to a contractor. How do I register as a contractor with the City of Bradenton? Here are Accela Contractor Registration and Permit Instructions . How can I check the progress of my permit application? Customers can check the status of their permit application plans review, fees and inspections through the Accela Online Permit Search . Can I start work when I submit a permit application before it is approved? No - not usually. In an emergency such as air-conditioning or water heater replacement with the approval of the Building Official, work up to the first required inspection may be allowed. Otherwise, you must have the permit posted at the job site prior to commencing work. How much time do I have to get the work completed once the permit is issued? Permits expire and become null and void if work is not started and an inspection is not approved within 180 days from the issuance date of the permit. After such work has commenced, the permit will expire when work is suspended or abandoned for a period of 6 months unless a passed inspection is obtained. How can I reinstate an expired permit? To reinstate an expired permit the contractor of record, or an Authorized Agent will need to complete the Permit Extension/Reinstatement Form, which can be requested by email from permitting@bradentonfl.gov and attach a letter of explanation as to why the permit expired without receiving the required inspections. Once complete, you can bring the request in-person or email to permitting@bradentonfl.gov for approval by the Building Official. If approved, the fee to reinstate will be the cost of permit unless the project was $200 or more, at which the cost to reinstate will be $200. When do I need a Notice of Commencement (NOC) and where do I file it? A Notice of Commencement can be filed at the Manatee County Clerk of the Court, 1115 Manatee Ave. W., and is required when the value of the work exceeds $5,000. In the case of repairing or replacing an existing heating or air-conditioning system, a Notice of Commencement is required when the value of work exceeds $7,500. (F.S. 713.13).  The City of Bradenton requires that the certified copy of the NOC be submitted to the Building Department before your first inspection. Who is allowed to request an inspection? Whoever is listed as the contractor of record on the permit application or their registered Authorized Agent. How are inspections requested? Inspections can be scheduled either by phone at 941-932-9423, online through Accela by navigating to \"Inspections\" within the \"Record Information\" section of the permit record, or by calling a Permit Specialist at 941-932-9414. When I call for an inspection, when will it be performed? The inspection will be performed on the date requested, with the exception of same-day or time-specific inspections which need to be approved by the inspector and have an additional fee of $150. When are inspectors available? Inspectors are generally available Monday-Friday from 7:30-8:30 a.m. and 2:00-3:30 p.m. Otherwise, they are in the field performing inspections and may not be readily available to answer their phones. Do I need to request a final inspection? All permit types need a final inspection. The final inspection provides closure to your permit and signals the completion of that project. Do I need a Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or Certificate of Completion (CC)? Generally all new construction, commercial additions, and change of occupancy require the issuance of a CO. If you are a homeowner doing repair work on your home you do not need a CO. For minor repairs or alterations, a Certificate of Completion (CC) can be issued upon request. Does the City issue Temporary Certificates of Occupancy? TCOs are issued for commercial work when non-life safety issues are pending and are typically for stocking purposes only. TCO’s must be approved by the Building Official prior to issuance.
