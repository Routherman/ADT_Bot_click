MEET THE GRAND OAKS TEAM TOM GOLISANO Owner In March of 2011, a new plan for development of an equine destination resort in central Florida was launched with Tom Golisano’s purchase of the Florida Carriage Museum. Since that time, the lush museum property has evolved The Grand Oaks Resort of today with a variety of new features including our RV Park, covered arena, and new guest accommodations and amenities. Tom Golisano is a noted American entrepreneur and philanthropist. Golisano is the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Paychex, Inc., the second largest payroll processing company in the U.S., and he served as its President and Chief Executive Officer until 2004. He founded the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in 1985 to provide and improve services for individuals with developmental disabilities, and he and is the Special Olympics’ largest individual contributor. Golisano has often been recognized for his entrepreneurial, civic, and philanthropic achievements and endeavors. Paychex is a Fortune 1000 company, and Golisano was listed among Forbes’ Top 10 Bosses in the U.S. for three consecutive years, beginning in 2002. KACY TIPTON-FASHIK General Manager Grand Oaks Resort & Saddle Club has promoted Kacy Tipton-Fashik to General Manager. Kacy Tipton-Fashik previously served as the resort’s Equine Manager and Assistant Manager, under Thomas Warriner. Warriner had been instrumental in marketing both resort and competition based equine ventures throughout the US, South and Central America and the Pacific basin. In her new role, she is responsible for leading the resort staff, orchestrating major events, overseeing the guest experience, and managing all day-to-day business at Grand Oaks. “I am delighted to continue to grow in my career here at Grand Oaks,” Tipton-Fashik said. “Our combination of natural beauty, guest amenities, and signature equestrian facilities and events makes this a resort unlike any other.” Tipton-Fashik brings extensive experience at the resort to her new role as General Manager. She first started at the property in November 1999, when it was still known as the Florida Carriage Museum. Over the years, she has helped grow Grand Oaks into the unique destination for equestrians, leisure travelers, and sporting enthusiasts that it is today. With a lifetime of riding and equestrian sports enthusiasm, and more than a decade of business management experience, Tipton-Fashik is well suited to lead Grand Oaks into the future. She also enjoys the variety of activities at Grand Oaks and the laid-back family resort atmosphere. 352.750.5500 • Ext. 229 E-MAIL KACY PLEASE NOTE : All guests and competitors must view and sign our liability release online.

Joyce and her Staff in Reservations and Management were Wonderful Hosts in setting up our Reservation from 11-01-2024 through 12-15-2024 and Comforting Settling us in. Stacey and her Husband were Great Camp Hosts visiting our Site with a Wealth of Information and Answering our Questions. This is a Beautiful RV Park setting on a Horse Ranch of 400 Acres with Beautiful Drives through the Ranch.  There are Pull Through and Back in Sites with Full Hook Ups, on Level Concrete Pads and the Sites are Very Spacious.  We had Great Internet, TV, and Phone Service here. Very Clean and Well Maintained it is Luxurious with a Nice Club House, Pool, and Laundry Facilities. It is so Quiet and Peaceful here, yet drive 15 Minutes and 10 Miles or so and You are in the Heart of the Villages, with all the Recreation and Amenities, Restaurants, Grocery Stores, Retail Stores etc.  The RV Resort has its own Restaurant, the Bistro with Great Food, and Megan, Susie, Jerika, and Debbie will make You feel at home. We took in Three Different Equestrian Horse Shows on Three Different Weekends in the RV Park, English Dressage, Show Jumping and Wagon Racing, and on another Weekend a Dog Agility Show !  There are many State Parks in the Area, we took two Boat Tours and saw Manatees and Alligators and all kinds of Birds and Wildlife.  Beaches on the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast are only a little over an hour away. We are coming back 12-15-2025 through 01-30-2026.
