That’s exactly what went down at Brandon’s birthday bash at Iron Axe Bar & Grill in South Daytona. Savor Delicious Food and Drinks at Iron Axe Bar and Grill We kicked things off with drinks and ordered some food while our server, who doubled as our axe-throwing coach, laid down the rules and gave us some much-needed tips. I opted for the hand-cut dry-aged ribeye and fried green tomatoes, expecting typical bar fare. I was pleasantly surprised – the steak was on point, and those fried green tomatoes made for a great start to the night. The Mrs. loved the mac and cheese and has been raving about it ever since. Then it was time to get competitive. My wife and I both have competitive spirits and always enjoy a good challenge. We split into teams, and the game was on. Every bullseye got us roaring with cheers, while the misses were met with endless chuckles and smack talk from the other team. We had people there who were ready to go and some more timid than others, but by the end of the night, everyone participated, and we made it a night to remember. And dare I say, the girls actually ended up being better than the guys! Each lane is rented by the hour. You can also easily reserve a spot online and add up to six people per lane. Games are projected onto the wood, giving you different targets during different games and lighting up when you hit a bullseye. Don’t forget to wear closed toed shoes! That is a must if you want to participate. Axe Throwing Tips and Tricks For anyone new to axe throwing, here are a few tips that really helped me: First, your grip matters – hold the axe like you’re shaking hands with it, firm but not too tight. For your stance, keep your feet shoulder width apart and your weight slightly forward. If you’re right-handed, step forward with your left foot as you throw and keep everything lined up with the target. The key is in the release – start with the axe high over your head, swing it down smoothly, and let go when it’s parallel to the target. You want it to rotate just once before it sticks. And remember, consistency is crucial. It’s not about power but getting that smooth throw every time. Don’t forget the follow-through! Enjoy More Games: Cornhole, Darts, and Giant Jenga Iron Axe Bar and Grill isn’t just about axe throwing. They’ve got cornhole, darts, and giant Jenga if you need a break from the throwing action. The vibe is chill but with plenty of energy. It’s the kind of place where you can be competitive without taking things too seriously. The staff kept everything running smoothly, making sure we were all having a blast and jumping in with tips when needed. It was a great space to throw a party – no pun intended! You don’t have to reserve a space if you pick a slower day and time of the week. We chose Monday at 6:30 p.m. We arrived a couple of minutes early and placed balloons and noisemakers out to “reserve” our spot. If you’re looking for a spot to relax, play some games, and enjoy great company, Iron Axe is definitely worth a visit. A big shoutout to Brandon and everyone who joined in – you made it a day to remember! Bobby G… out!
