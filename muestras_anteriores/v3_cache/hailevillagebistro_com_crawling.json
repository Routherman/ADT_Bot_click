These developments go back to the 1970s, when Haile Village Center was created in the middle of Haile Plantation, a 1,700-acre development with a variety of housing styles located west of Tower Road. Today, Haile Village Center offers dining, medical and professional offices, specialty shops and hosts events, including a farmer’s market on Saturday mornings. The area’s most recent live, work and play community is the 160-acre Celebration Pointe, located along I-75, north of Archer Road. Celebration Pointe has developed over the past decade both as a lifestyle center for local folks and a regional destination for shopping that includes a Bass Pro Shops as well as Nike, Tommy Hilfiger and Skechers outlet stores. The development is centered around The Promenade, a pedestrian area with venues, including Kilwins and The Keys Grill & Piano Bar. Spurrier’s Gridiron Grille, named after former University of Florida football coach and Heisman Trophy winner Steve Spurrier will open in 2021. Celebration Pointe includes the Hotel Indigo. The second phase of the community’s Main Street project is developing. The expansion includes more retail space, 100 luxury apartments and offices. Dave & Buster’s, Prime & Pearl restaurant and Sensei Asian Bistro are part of the growth. Celebration Pointe is leasing a 220-unit luxury apartment project known as City Place. The VUE, Celebration Pointe’s townhome development, is also growing. A third live, work and play community is the Town of Tioga, a neo-traditional development on Newberry Road that incorporates a variety of housing styles on small lots reminiscent of historic small towns. The Town of Tioga includes the Tioga Town Center, a shopping, dining, office and apartment complex. The town center hosts events, such an art show and the Tioga Car Show. It features a Gainesville Health and Fitness branch, shopping such as Down to Earth Boutique, Lang Jewelers and Complete Home Boutique, and offices for other businesses including AEI Affiliated Engineers,Weyerhaeuser, and UF Health Pediatrics. Hankin Group, the town center’s owner, is adding 144 luxury apartments to its existing group of apartments there, and it is building 15,000 square feet of retail space. Tioga Evolves The Town of Tioga was considered to be ahead of its time when it began selling homes in 1997, developer Luis Diaz said. Luis and his father, Migel, were considered daring in placing homes closely together like they were in early American villages and in their native country of Venezuela – as an alternative to building on larger suburban lots. In developing the property, which had been a farm, they walked the woods over and over in an effort to maximize the common green space. “We were determined to preserve the old tree lines,” Luis Diaz said. Acceptance of the Town of Tioga concept has grown over time, and the community has grown to 420 homes – with more on the way. “People who don’t live here park their cars and take a walk, and couples use Tioga as a background for engagement photos. It’s a great compliment,” Diaz said. The merchants in Tioga Town Center find it a good place to do business. Blue Highway is in its 11th year in the community. “We could not have chosen a better location for our business,” said Layla Rufino, who owns the business with her husband, Frank. “Our guests enjoy coming here for the quality food, drink and shopping available.” Bich Nguyen, the owner of Enso: A Healthier Nail Boutique, said Tioga Town Center has exceeded his expectations. “There isn’t a better spot we could have opened the first non-toxic nail salon in Greater Gainesville,” he said. “It’s wonderful for us to feel accepted and welcomed from clients and other merchants alike from day one.” Jason Hurst, the owner of Maple Street Biscuit Company, also commented on the town center. “My wife and I had a vision to open a family-friendly, community-based location, and Tioga Town Center fit that description perfectly,” he said. “We have a wonderful extended family, and we attribute it to the warm atmosphere of being a part of the Tioga Town Center.” Cheryl Carroll, Regional Asset Manager for Hankin Group who owns and manages the Tioga Town Center and The Flats, also lives and works at the Town Center. “The healthy and diverse mixture of retail, medical, business, and restaurants brings so much value to living at The Flats,” she said. “My family and I love living in a community where we have everything we need, all within steps of our home.” Celebration Pointe Experience “I love to live my life here,” said Samantha Howe. “It’s a hub that brings a lot of people together.” The 2017 University of Florida graduate works at Infotech, a software and consulting company serving the transportation infrastructure industry that relocated its headquarters to Celebration Pointe in 2017. Howe, who lives in a nearby apartment, regularly takes Luna, her German shepherd mix dog to the Celebration Pointe dog park. Howe enjoys lunch, dinner and happy hour at the restaurants and bars along Celebration Pointe’s pedestrian-only Main Street. Haile Village Skip and Lynda Everitt have a perfect combination of lifestyles in the Hickory Walk section of Haile Plantation. They live on the Haile golf course while being able to walk to Haile Village Center for dining and neighborhood events. “Since I started playing golf at 13, I have wanted to live on a golf course, but I like a compact neighborhood that is relatively self-contained,” Skip said. “These two aspects of our situation go together well.” Everitt and his wife, Lynda, moved into Haile in 1993, and they have seen the massive development evolve over the years, adding two Publix supermarkets and many homes. Haile Village Center is better than ever. The Everitts enjoy eating at Limerock Road, That Bar and Table and Haile Village Bistro. “We see a whole lot of people we know when we go to them,” Skip said. They look forward to Haile Oktoberfest and the holiday lights each year. Lynda and Skip founded the Twilight Round Golf Tournament, an event held annually from 2003 to 2008 that honored Lynda’s father, a victim of Alzheimer’s Disease. “We got to know a lot of people through that,” Skip said. The couple values Hickory Walks’ diversity in terms of ages, professions, interests and cultures. “We have graduate students, people with young kids and people our age,” Skip said. “People mingle in our three common areas as well as gathering for the holidays in these neighborly spaces. We’ve never been happier.” Contact Us CostelloCM. Gainesville, FL (352) 281-2072 (352) 372-5957 scott@costellocm.com Subscribe to receive GUIDE news & articles in your inbox!

      "text": "Manager of Haile Village restaurants arrested for embezzling almost $68k from owner - Alachua Chronicle Skip to content Menu Home Categories Business Community organizations Crime Cultural events Education Elections Fires Health Letters to the editor Library Local government Opinion Public notices State government Traffic incidents Jail Booking Logs Obituaries Events Search Advertising About Us Contact Us Home Crime Manager of Haile Village restaurants arrested for embezzling almost $68k from owner Manager of Haile Village restaurants arrested for embezzling almost $68k from owner February 21, 2024 Staff report GAINESVILLE, Fla. – Shannon Jennifer Moccia, 44, was arrested yesterday and charged with grand theft and 127 other felonies after allegedly embezzling almost $68,000 while she was employed as manager of two Haile Village restaurants. The owner of Haile Village Bistro and the Queen’s Arm Pub contacted Alachua County Sheriff’s Office (ASO) last July to report that he believed Moccia, the general manager of both restaurants, was stealing from him. He said the agreement between him and Moccia was that Moccia and her husband would run the businesses and pay their expenses, paying the owner a percentage of the profits and splitting the remaining profits. Moccia was reportedly fired six days before the owner contacted ASO. The owner reported that the business bank account was linked to his personal account for overdraft protection, and after traveling overseas for several months in 2022, he noticed that about $40,000 had been transfered from his personal account to the business account, indicating that the business had lost that much money over that period. He told the investigator that over $150,000 was transferred out of his personal account to cover overdrafts in the business account between September 2022 and August 2023. The owner told the investigator that he knows many of the regular customers, and when he spoke to them, he learned that many of his regular customers had stopped patronizing the business after Moccia was hired as general manager. The owner told the investigator that he investigated the financial records of the business and learned that Moccia had been using the business’s credit card to purchase personal items and had also written 64 checks to herself. He said that when he confronted Moccia about this, she said the money was all used to operate the business, but she reportedly had no records or receipts to prove that. The personal items purchased on the business’s credit card totaled about $2,600, and the checks written to Moccia totaled about $29,000. The owner told the investigator that Moccia was authorized to withdraw cash from the bank account to replace cash in the register and pay tips to the servers, but the amounts of cash were calculated to be about $36,000 more than was needed. Post Miranda, Moccia reportedly admitted that she had purchased items on the business’s credit card, had written checks to herself, and had withdrawn cash from the business, but she said she was authorized to do those things by the owner; she said she did not understsand how she could have done anything wrong because she had “permission” to use the business’s funds as her own. She reportedly said that she “blended” her personal finances with the business’s finances and that she wrote checks to herself as reimbursement for items she purchased for the business; however, she said she had no receipts to prove that. Moccia reportedly said she reimbursed the business for any funds she used for personal expenses, but the investigator wrote that the bank statements show that that is “no discernible record” of money moving from her personal account back to the business account. When the investigator asked Moccia why the amounts she paid out for tips were increasing during a period when the restaurants were failing to the point that one restaurant closed, she reportedly could not answer. She also reportedly changed her statement to say she had kept receipts, but they were in the safe at the business. The investigator concluded that Moccia stole almost $68,000 from the business. Moccia has been charged with grand theft over $20,000, fraudulently obtaining property over $50,000, fraudulent use of a credit card, 64 counts of writing fraudulent checks, and 61 counts of using a two-way communications device to commit a felony for using a mobile applicaton to deposit 61 of the checks. Moccia has no criminal history; Judge Thomas Jaworski set bail at $100 per count, for a total of $12,800. Articles about arrests are based on reports from law enforcement agencies. The charges listed are taken from the arrest report and/or court records and are only accusations. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
