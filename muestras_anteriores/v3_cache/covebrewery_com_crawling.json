With an appearance and color we describe as antique gold, you soon taste the roundness and clean aftertaste but without that big beer tang.  We carefully dialed the fermentation temps on this one, to bring you a fresh, and not much in the way of bitterness.  Its attractive, bright and refreshing.  Clean and balanced with a beautiful rocky head, the bitterness is quick, and vanishes with no aftertaste.  Unlike your typical lager, this Ale opens up your interest in local craft beer.  Hops here take a subtle showing, built on several noble hops with a tiny flare of a surprise aroma addition.  We are showcasing the UK, Canadian and German malts. Pairs very well with Shed or Kitchen Parties! FLAGSHIP: “RED VINYL”  (YEAR ROUND - SILVER WINNER - 2023 and 2022 CANADIAN BREWING AWARDS) ABV = 5% STYLE = IRISH RED Ale SILVER MEDAL WINNER - 2023 & 2022 CANADIAN BREWING AWARDS!!!! Newfoundland's favourite Red Ale.  Distributed Island Wide for a reason.  Available year round in the taproom.  Canada voted twice, and Newfoundlanders love our Red Vinyl. “THE GREAT AUK”  (SEASONAL - BRONZE WINNER - 2023  CANADIAN BREWING AWARDS) ABV = 10% STYLE = TRIPLE IPA BRONZE MEDAL WINNER - 2023 CANADIAN BREWING AWARDS!!!! THE GREAT AUK IS RESURRECTED.  TRIPLE IPA.  HOPPY.  WARMING.  DELICIOUS. FLAGSHIP:  \"HARD CASE IN YOUR FACE\" - DIPA (SEASONAL) ABV = 7% STYLE = DOUBLE IPA We crafted this beer for one reason.  WE LOVE IPA’s.  Its big and bold like a winter storm. We call it the Adult version of a Juice Pack.  We wanted to bring modern beer to our audience that is aromatic, lazy and hazy like your first trip off the Rock to a tropical destination.  Loaded with late addition hops and we can’t help but set the stage here with this DIPA, the hops are in your face. Pairs very well with anything grilled or with your hard case buddy! \"OPEN LIME\" - (YEAR ROUND) ABV = 4% STYLE = BLONDE with LIME Inspired from out Gold Medal James Blonde 00709, we brewed a lighter version at 4% and added a balanced amount of fresh lime zest.  Our new headliner at the taproom. \"COVE PREMIUM LAGER\" - (YEAR ROUND) ABV = 4% STYLE = LIGHT PREMIUM LAGER Our Flagship Lager.  Served year round at the taproom.  Available for distribution.  Crisp.  Clean.  Crushable. \"A NIGHT AT THE RASPBERRY\" - RASPBERRY SOUR ABV = 4% STYLE = FRUITED SOUR ***  SEASONAL FRUITED SOUR!  WILD RASPBERRIES WITH A HINT OF TARTNESS.  AVAILABLE AS LONG AS WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON WILD NL RASPBERRIES. *** AVAILABLE IN CANS WHILE SUPPLIES LAST! \"COME HOME BEER\" - APRICOT WHEAT (SEASONAL) ABV = 5% STYLE:  APRICOT WHEAT ALE When any Newfoundlander is vacationing it’s a simple and fair question to ask: “When did you get home?” Home. Is. Newfoundland. Our Apricot Wheat Ale celebrates being home, back on the island. For us, it’s more of a personal thing and tribute to growing up and having our grandmother cooking apricots on the back of the stove. She loved her apricot jam! Let’s say hello to our summer seasonal ale we titled, “Come Home Beer” Pairs very well with homemade bread right out of the oven smothered in summer. \"CHIN MUSIC\" - APA (YEAR ROUND) ABV = 5.2% STYLE = AMERICAN PALE ALE During earlier times in Newfoundland, not owning an instrument was no reason not to celebrate & rejoice.  Story tellers would say, if a group of mummers did not have an instrument with them, the host for that night would sing “chin music” which is a mnemonic rhyme that mimics an accordion or fiddle tunes, so that during celebration we could dance.  This beer is music to your chin.  It is juicy, with huge tropical aromas, undeniable balance, yet smashingly slammable.  If a blonde married an IPA, this is their brew child.  Categorized as an American Pale Ale clocking in at 5.2% ABV, you soon realize that once you have a sip of Chin Music, you will want to lift your chin to ask for another. Pairs very well with anything related to summer! “THE PORT AU PORTER” - ROBUST PORTER (SOLD OUT) ABV = 6% STYLE:  ROBUST PORTER With an appearance and color we describe as a chocolate lovers paradise, the soft mouth feel, combined with the complex and rich German grain bill provides the perfect roasted character reminiscent of chocolate and coffee.  With a firm but med low  hop bitterness, this Porter strikes balance between the residual sweetness and the carefully selected highly kilned specialty grains.  Who doesn’t love freshly baked homemade chocolate cake, just like your grandmother made? Pairs very well with soft vanilla ice cream, and homemade chocolate cake ! FLAGSHIP: \"MALT WATER JOYS\" - BROWN ALE ABV = 5% STYLE = TRADITIONAL BROWN ALE Clean and balanced with a pleasant biscuit-like background, a slight toffee flavor hidden behind a well rounded balance of caramel and a subtle hint of chocolate.  Hops here take a back burner approach.  We are showcasing the UK malts. Pairs very well with a Newfoundland Caramel Log. \"THE NEWFIE BULLET\" - LAGERED ALE ABV = 4.5% STYLE = LAGERED ALE / KOLSCH Clean and balanced crisp with a light ester profile is very crushable.  Pairs well with lighter fair and fresh fish and street fries. \"OAT TO NFLD\" - AMERICAN OAT PALE ALE  (YEAR ROUND) Style: Devoted Pale Ale ABV = 4.9% Akin to Newfoundland’s official anthem where traditionally the first and last verses are sung, this Hoppy and Devoted Pale Oat Ale is delicious from the first sip to the last. Featuring a signature smooth and silky mouthfeel, this orange delight is triple dry hopped with Classic American hops which playfully represent this very attractive summer ale. Pairs very well with patios, chips, beach fires, and random acts of silence. \"OCEAN DUST\" - SALT WATER GOSE (SEASONAL SOLD OUT) Style:  GOSE ABV = 4.8% Brewed with actual salt sea water for salinity.  Hints of Orange from coriander and orange peel. \"DREAM OF THE WEST\" - CREAM ALE (YEAR ROUND) Style:  CREAM ALE ABV = 5% Available year round.  A favorite at the taproom.  Crisp, clean and crushable. \"TUCKAMORE IPA\" (YEAR ROUND) Style:  IPA ABV = 5% Available year round.  A favorite at the taproom.  Crisp, HOPPY, clean and a local favorite.   This beer is available in the taproom, its out house IPA. \"CHESTERFIELD ROAD\" - SESSION IPA (SEASONAL) Style:  IPA ABV = 4.8% Available most of the year.  A favorite among fans of IPAs.  Crisp, HOPPY, clean and a well balanced. \"CITRA ARSE DOWN\" - IPA (SEASONAL) Style:  IPA ABV = 6% Available FALL of the year.  A favorite among fans of IPAs.  Showcasing CITRA hops.  Crisp, HOPPY, clean and a well balanced. \"THE CABOX\" - WEST COAST DIPA (YEAR ROUND) Style:  DIPA ABV = 8.1% Available YEAR ROUND.  A smooth DIPA showcasing the highest elevation on the Island portion of the Island.  The CABOX is the highest point and a hikers dream on the West Coast.  Showcasing CITRA, SIMCOE hops.  BOLD, HOPPY and a well balanced. \"SHOUT AT THE KETTLE\" - DIPA (SEASONAL) Style:  DIPA ABV = 7% Available SEASONALLY.  A smooth DIPA loaded with Idaho7 hops.

This is quickly becoming the local hotspot and the place to be. They have a tap list that has a good variety of interesting beach-brewed beers. Doris and I arrived slightly after 2 pm so we missed the lunch rush, which was perfect. We pretty much had the place to ourselves. The location is open and airy with a multitude of different types of seating areas from sofas, to a lounge area, high tops, tables, both indoor and outdoor seating, and a beautiful bar. A really cool feature is that they have windows along the rear wall so that you can actually see where they are brewing the beer.  They are located right over the bridge off Hillsboro Blvd., just under a mile from the beach. For our brews, I enjoyed the refreshing Heatwave Wheat and Doris raved about the full-body thirst-quenching Hellas Lager. The Brewers here definitely know their stuff.  It was getting late for lunch soon.  We had not yet eaten, we, therefore, decided to sample a couple of bites from Won Toms. They have a cool arrangement with the Cove Brewery.  You simply order on your phone from your table and Won Toms brings the food over. It’s a very futuristic approach and the most welcome concept. For our starters, we had the soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) which were bursting with pork and a hint of crispy chili garlic oil.  They were a perfect balance of both heat and savory. We also tried the Korean Fried Chicken. Another masterpiece of Gochujang Buffalo sauce balanced perfectly by refreshing cucumber, micro cilantro, and a tangy Yuzu ranch dip.  Next came the Honey Garlic Shrimp, a tempura dream coated in a sweet and savory honey garlic glaze. Each bite was a delightful explosion of textures and tastes, accented by the crunch of peanuts and crispy scallions. On to the star of the show the Wagyu smash burger which decided to split.  This Bulgogi-Wagyu burger blend, layered with scallions, shallots, and gooey white American cheese, is quickly becoming a local legend. Each bite was a juicy, flavorful masterpiece, drizzled with Japanese mayo and a secret sauce (BGSA) that had us begging for more. Don’t miss out on this one – it’s a contender for the best burger you’ll ever have!  For our vegans out there, Troy brought out The Mongolian Taco, a flavor explosion nestled in a crispy cabbage cup.  It is filled with mushrooms, grilled shallots, and a symphony of fresh toppings. It is a testament to the restaurant’s creativity. We enjoyed the vibe of the Cove Shopping Center location which is loaded with great food selections. However, please know that this combination of Won Tom’s and the Cove Brewery is the crowning jewel. This is a truly fun place, with great food, from WonTom’s. Do your family and best buds a favor and stop in, relax, enjoy, and let them know that SoFloDining sent you.
