With fewer trees, wider landing areas, native heather and mounding framing the fairways, Crooked Cat presents golfers more of a links-style look. It may well be the most naturally beautiful Orlando Florida golf course. The course’s open feel encourages golfers to grip it and rip it off the tee, and there is certainly more room for error and multiple options for playing a hole both off the tee and into the greens. Crooked Cat is not a connect-the-dots course; feel free to take your own approach and use the entire course. But beware: As with links-style courses, there is an element of chance, and a wayward shot can end up in one of many seemingly randomly placed grass bunkers. Gamblers and scramblers will do well. So will shot makers. Crooked Cat is more exposed and the routing twists and turns, so the wind comes at you from ever-changing directions and is a real factor. Players who appreciate the challenge of working the ball up, down, left, right to counteract or ride the wind will get a chance to showcase their mastery and get the most out of the course. The back nine of Crooked Cat may be the best nine on the property and is the favorite of many low handicap golfers due to its length and challenge. Even if you don’t have ball shaping down to an art or the deft touch to escape like Houdini from any peril in your way, Crooked Cat is incredibly fun to play. And because of the unique design you’ll never get tired of challenging this course because you will never play any hole the same way twice. No other Orlando Florida golf course offers this much versatility, challenge, and fun. All of these reasons made Cooked Cat the perfect choice to host the LIV Golf league in March 2023. Juniors must be at least 6 years old to be on Crooked Cat course.

Playing over rolling meadows, through native pines, around and over wetlands, lakes, and up and down elevation changes of up to 60 feet, it is first and foremost a visual delight, reminding you that natural beauty is one of the main reasons you play golf and a major factor in deciding which course to play. Panther Lake offers some of the best examples of natural beauty that Orlando area golf courses have to offer.You will likely encounter many native species of birds and wildlife during your round, which will be enjoyed in the most tranquil of settings. Every hole on Panther Lake is unique and requires something different from your shot making repertoire. This is another feature that makes this Central Florida golf course so special; when you finish your round you will likely be able to recall each hole very vividly as they are all very different in appearance as well as appealing in design to the eye. The variety in design is evident in the way no two holes play alike. There are no boring holes at Panther Lake, and each is as distinct and memorable as the last. The only characteristic the holes share is that each shot demands good thinking and precise execution. Off the tee, you will face gently sloping fairways guarded by strategically placed fairway bunkers, trees and water hazards that frame the holes and provide a clear line of play. From the fairway, you will hit many approaches into well-guarded elevated greens, which are large and have plenty of contours, so two-putting isn’t automatic. Simply put, good shots will be rewarded and bad shots penalized, the hallmark of great courses everywhere. If you’re looking for a bit more golf course, the tour tees provide as stern a test as you’ll find anywhere, with intimidating carries and risk-reward approaches that can lead to birdies or bogeys. From the three forward tees, you’ll face shorter carries, softer angles and wider landing areas, making Panther Lake more friendly but no less memorable. When you play #10, look at the shot from 150 yards to the green. That is the spot where Tiger Woods was told to ‘Get more forgiving irons, the Nike Pro-Combos’ by his talking head cover, Frank, during the very popular commercial. Will you be able to hit the elevated green from there with your irons? Juniors must be at least 6 years old to be on Panther Lake course.

We have hosted numerous college and international golf teams for their annual spring training, as well as golf schools and clinics for guests from around the world.

No matter what you need to work on there is plenty of room and options for you to get your work done and lower your scores. While it may not be the most fun part of golf, practice is what will make you better and there is no other practice facility like this anywhere. It truly is the best Orlando golf package in town.
