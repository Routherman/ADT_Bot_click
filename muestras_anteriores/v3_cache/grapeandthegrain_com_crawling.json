Our new premises and heritage centre was opened to coincide with the 175th anniversary of John Arkell founding Arkell's Brewery in 1843. A very proud day it was on 30 January 2018 when we were delighted to welcome HRH The Duchess of Cornwall to celebrate the occasion and for her Highness to take a tour of the warehouse before officially unveiling a plaque in honour of her visit. Today, the Grape & Grain Wine & Brewery Warehouse is run by our Directors, Nicholas Arkell and Richard Bailey. Assisted by Rowan Doyle, Lisa Aldridge, Karen Conn, Lesley Dicks and Paul Buckingham. We are open 9-5pm from Monday to Friday to members of the public & the trade, who can not only browse & purchase from our premium selection of wines, beers & spirits but also feel free to explore our heritage centre upstairs.

A little about us: Two of our favorite things in life are traveling and spending time with friends, family, and meeting new people who become friends. We moved to Germany in August of 2021, and living abroad has certainly been an adventure. We started our website to share our stories with family and friends back home, and to have a travel diary with photos of our trips. Besides our collection of travel stories and tips , we have a page for foods of the world , which includes our culinary adventures and recipes we collect from around Europe. We also share some of our favorite books , both fiction and non-fiction, mostly around travel or food themes. Lastly, our page for living abroad includes local trips, international sporting events, and festivals around Germany. We love the feeling of home and fellowship that Irish Pubs all over the world offer. With this in mind, we try to style our stories to match the friendliness of the Irish, telling them as if we are sharing them with friends down at the pub . We hope that our site is either helpful, entertaining, or both. Cheers! We are so grateful for this opportunity to travel around Europe. Even the challenges of living in another country are an opportunity for growth. Sometimes we feel like we are semi-retired, because of the slower pace of life here. Often we dream of when we end this assignment and head back to the US. Buying a home after being an expat should be especially interesting. We’ll buy the first one that has air conditioning! Or a garbage disposal. For now, we’ll remember to appreciate where we are and what we have. Meanwhile, we may look at living in another country. Italy always seems appealing! But enough about us. 😊 Search by TOPIC International Sports Mini Adventures Albania Austria Belgium Croatia Czech Republic Denmark Egypt England Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Latvia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Norway Poland Portugal Romania Scotland Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland Tunisia Turkey The Grain and Grape provides travel photos, stories, and recommendations from around the world.

Allow up to 3 days for an email response. I have a question about: Wine Tastings Difference between a Wine Tasting and a Wine Flight Wine Tastings require a reservation and are conducted in our restaurant. Please allow for an hour of tastings with a presentation from one of our knowledgeable staff members. Tastings are $15 per person plus tax. Tastings are for groups of up to 15 people per hour. Tastings are offered Thursday – Sunday Only. Wine Flights are a self-guided wine tasting and do not require a reservation . You may pick your flight in our store during open hours (7 days a week) and enjoy your wine under our outside tents or in the restaurant. Flights are $10 per person plus tax. Wine Flights are for groups of 8 or less. If you do not want to have a tasting or flight but want to enjoy a glass and/or bottle of wine you are welcome to visit our restaurant, Brew & Brats at Arbor Hill, where you can purchase wine by the glass or a bottle. Do I need a reservation for a wine tasting? Yes, If you’d like a guided tasting please book a reservation on our Wine Tastings page, but if you’re just looking for a wine flight stop in anytime the shop is open! If the online reservation system does not offer the day/time you are looking for the slot is either full or unavailable. Please pick a different day/time. What if I have a Passport? Did you purchase a Canandaigua Lake Wine Trail Passport? You still need to make a reservation but before your do please email info@thegrapery.com with a copy of your receipt. We will send you the coupon code required to make your reservation online. If you prefer not to have a full wine tasting you may use your passport for a flight. Be sure to bring your mobile passport with you for your tasting or flight. See our Wine Tasting page for more information or to book a reservation. Ship a Grape Pie We no longer ship Grape Pies. They get destroyed in the shipping process no matter how well we pack them. You can purchase the pie filling we use in our pies. Click HERE for the link. Restaurant Location The restaurant sits directly behind the winery. Just a few steps away. We even share the same parking lot. Bringing my dog Both Arbor Hill Winery Gift Shop and our restaurant, Brew and Brats at Arbor Hill, welcome dogs under our tents which are setup between the winery and restaurant May through October. Water bowls are scattered around or just ask. Dogs are not allowed inside the shop or restaurant. Bringing my kids We are a family friendly establishment. We even offer a juice tasting which can be made the same way you make your wine tasting or can be enjoyed the same way a flight is. Winter Hours Both the Winery Gift Shop and Restaurant are open year-round. Visit the home page of each for hours of operation as they may vary. Live Music Schedule Check out our live music schedule . Bachelorette/Limo Bus/Large Group Inquiry Our wine tasting reservations can accommodate up to 15 people. Wine flights can accommodate up to 8 people.
