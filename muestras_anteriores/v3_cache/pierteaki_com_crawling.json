Whether you're sharing a romantic evening or enjoying a night out with friends, our rooftop tiki bar guarantees unforgettable moments. Guests must be 21 or older after 8pm. Shop Gift Cards Take a glance at The Pier Teaki Menu Learn about our Service Charge Learn More Our aim is to professionalize one of the only industries in the world that has no guaranteed income for the service provider, (i.e., the hospitality industry). We have adopted a service model that utilizes a sales commission for every dollar sold for an employee, regardless of discount. This commission-based system has been in use for decades. We are proud to continue setting a high standard for employee compensation in the vibrant Florida restaurant industry. Our company’s legacy is built on the belief that legendary service is provided by a team – not just one person. It is shown in every detail of the Teak LLC experience. Ever since opening in 2020, we have been committed to compensating all employees, both front and back of the house, as the professionals they are. This model ensures that our team will thrive, our guests will continue to receive an outstanding experience and our company is well-positioned for the future. What is a service charge? A 20% service charge is included on each check. Teak LLC retains 100% of the service charge. Does this mean that your servers will make less? No. This model was implemented in Seattle almost two years ago and in Dunedin a year and a half ago so we have extensive data which tells us that it is working well for staff, guests, and the companies. Our servers and bartenders are paid a commission and there is a revenue share model for the rest of the service team. The result is that the whole team benefits from delighting our guests from the moment they arrive until they leave us for the night. Our entire team will do as well or better with this model. Our professional service team receives industry-leading compensation including commissions on sales, health insurance, matched 401K, and extensive education and training for a successful career path. Are you also raising prices? No. In fact, we are developing ways to add even more value to our guests by not having to raise prices due to labor costs. What will you do if a guest is upset about their service? We know that excellent service is provided by a team – not just one person. It is shown in every detail of the Teak LLC experience and all our people are dedicated to providing that. We stand behind what we do. If a guest is not delighted – we will make it right. That’s what we have always done. Will employees still be rewarded for a job well done? Our servers and bartenders are paid a commission and there is a revenue share model for the rest of the service team. The result is that the whole team benefits from delighting our guests from the moment they arrive until they leave us for the night. Our entire team will do as well or better with this model. In addition, we provide health insurance to our team and their families (at 25 hours a week.) We have a great 401K with matching program and a career path with extensive training opportunities. We really want people to build their careers with us. That is why we invest so much in training and development so that our team grows and thrives. What if there is a problem with my experience? If there is any aspect of your experience that does not exceed expectations, we will make it right. What if I still want to leave a tip? Additional gratuities are accepted but not expected. You guys are already so expensive, isn’t this going to scare people off? This percentage is already in line with what most of our guests were leaving as a gratuity. Our guests come here because they know they are getting the very best service. Now it is just inclusive in the bill. They don’t have to do the math. It’s just part of what we do. Is this going to help with the disparity between front of the house and kitchen compensation? Our company culture doesn’t work that way. We have always paid well and provided great benefits to all of our employees. It is part of why people love working here. We respect our employees for the pros they are. We pay them well; we provide health insurance to our team and their families. We have a great 401K with matching program and a career path with extensive training opportunities. We really want people to build their careers with us. That is why we invest so much in training and development so that our team grows and thrives. What has the reaction been from employees? We have been talking to our team for a while now about this and have taken their input to heart and I believe they know that we are absolutely committed to making sure they do as well or better than they did before. Our team is made up of professionals who have made hospitality their career and they count on doing well here because they have families, they are homeowners, they are active members of their community. Teaki Huts & Large Events At Pier Teaki, there are a few options for hosting private events. Our Teaki Huts overlooking St. Pete’s skyline and Tampa Bay.

We came up to the restaurant and at first it seemed like it was self serve at the bar. It turned out there were less than a dozen visible employees roaming the area and waiting tables. My daughter went to the bar to order our drinks after trying to figure out the schematic. The drinks were delicious and strong. We saw a server giving another table chips with guacamole, queso and salsa and we asked our would be server if we could get this. It was very good but definitely not enough chips vs dips. We were looking for another bowl( small) of chips to finish our stuff and I literally had to ask 4 separate employees for a bowl of chips. The last one we asked (the only girl) finally brought them. Our initial server came over after we asked at the bar ( 2 different guys) and then our waiter. My biggest mistake was when the manager came around asking how things were and we said ok. That was before we decided to order food and needed help. It was $14 for the appetizer. They had the nerve to charge me $4 for the additional chips and then automatically added a 20% tip to the bill. Hence the reason for the poor service. They get the tip anyway. It put a damper on an otherwise lovely experience.

Lesliekay St. Petersburg 8 contributions 0 3 of 5 bubbles Adjusting the tip to help the servers? Jan 2025 • business Service at the bar was fine at best.  The view is amazing.  I appreciate that they tell you they will add 20% and gladly added a little bit additional as I usually tip at least 25%.  However, my credit card company sent me an alert a couple days later that said  I gave a 229% tip.  Confused, I looked and they changed the total for the drinks to $19 and the tip to $49 - I assume so they could make more on the tip (we were drinking draft beer).  If you're going to charge the 20%, don't adjust it, really bad business practice.

Jul 2024 • couples I spotted this amazing bar/restaurant before our holiday and we were able to test it!\nThe place is really beautiful: Really cool tiki decor and incredible view that gives a sophisticated side, you really have to stop there!\nThe cocktails are really great, as well as the burgers.\nTheir homemade chips are also delicious.\nOnly small negative points: There was no fan (as in other places) so at times it was extremely hot, and the waitress offered us something in the cocktails without telling us it was paying.\n\nBut otherwise, the place deserves the detour and it is not so expensive!

Apr 2024 • friends The worst customer service I’ve experienced!\nWe asked two lovely ladies on a large table if we could sit at the other end of their table. Right after we sat down one of the ladies received her very simple taco dish, nothing for the other lady. After about 15 minutes the lady stopped the waiter and asked if her meal was on its way. He said her dish takes longer to prepare. After this we watched this waiter pass their table multiple times and never stopped to give an update or apologise for the wait. In the next 15 minutes we watched many large trays full of plates go to different tables. If the server wasn’t walking around he was standing doing nothing with his back against the bar. \nI have worked in the service industry for years and I couldn’t cope any longer. I stopped another employee and explained the issue and he said he would get the manager or server, unfortunately he got the server. He said the kitchen was backed up. No I’m sorry, no I’ll bring you a drink on the house, no I’ll get my manager, nothing. My husband couldn’t believe his behaviour, this server had zero customer service.\nIt was one ladies first visit to the US. Because the server had no intention of trying to make the ladies feel welcome my husband asked to offer the ladies each a drink and he would pay for it. The server asked them in a very unfriendly way if they would like a drink and then brought my husband the bill without making any eye contact or speaking. Shortly after this interaction the food finally arrived and it was a very simple grouper sandwich. No reason it would have taken that long.\nWe’ve eaten at this restaurant many times as well as enjoyed the bar and have never seen this type of service. \nBy the way we had to get our drinks at the bar because the server took forever to come over.\n\nOur favourite bartender Bradly would never have allowed this to happen. I’m assuming the server either had zero training, doesn’t like his job or was having a bad day. Needless to say management needs to do a better job.

How times have changed!\n\nAfter our arrival and having been waiting a while, there was no sign of any waiters coming to take our order. So my husband went to the bar to order our drinks. On this visit he ordered two different cocktails (from memory I think they were the Pier Teaki Rum Runner and the Goombay Smash) and was surprised to see that the cocktails were not freshly mixed by the bartender - one was poured from a large plastic bottle, the other from a dispensing tap on the back wall of the bar. Both the cocktails tasted awful. In fact, they were undrinkable and we left them, having taken only a few sips of each. They were not cheap and were served in plastic glasses. In hindsight, we should have complained but we had a dinner reservation and needed to leave. My husband had not been given a check, and had paid the bartender giving a generous tip (not being aware of the compulsory 20% service charge).\n\nWe did return the following afternoon. This was just for a beer each and to cool down and enjoy the location before returning to our holiday base in Orlando. On this occasion we noticed that there was a compulsory 20% service charge for drinks mentioned at the bottom of the drinks menu. We had not noticed this the previous evening. On this visit, when we asked for the check the waiter did inform us that a service charge had been added and he told us he had mentioned this when he took our order. We did point out that he had not mentioned this when he took our order (and had demanded our credit card before taking the order!) , and nor had the bartender the previous evening.\n\nIt's bad enough that they automatically add a 20% service charge to food orders, never mind \"drinks only\" orders (especially when you go to the bar to order them) Read more Written May 22, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Tiffany M 2 contributions 0 2 of 5 bubbles Not a great experience Jun 2024 • family I don't ever leave reviews but the chaos in this place was ridiculous. My husband and I met a family friend at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The view is beautiful and the staff was friendly. That's where the good portion ends. We ordered the dip trio which was delicious but half of the bowl was filled with chip crumbs. When we asked for new chips they did bring us a new bowl but they were actual potato chips and not tortilla chips. We then had to ask them for the correct type of chips which they promptly replaced. When our actual meals were delivered we only received the 2 burgers. When we asked where our 3rd meal was they seemed confused. I had to remind the waiter what it actually was and was told it was on its way. I didnt receive the lobster empanadas for an additional 20 minutes. One burger was delicious but the other smashburger was burned but our friend ate it anyway. We had issues getting our waters refilled but they were very attentive when a drink from the bar was empty. The automatic 20% tip added to your bill is also ridiculous. Read more Written June 3, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Feb 2024 • family Cut spot to sit.  Food was good, but very small portions, basically, upscale bar food or appetizers.  No sides, except bar made potato chips.  VERY expensive for what you get, plus 20% added on gratuity (and then waitress mentioned that was \"shared\" and requested more).  We all drank water.  Bill was $80+.  Family visiting heard it was \"great.\"  Nope.  Pier during the week was empty, nothing to see.  Obviously, night life is St. Pete.  Tarpon Springs would have been a better pick.

We had Javon as our server and he was friendly, efficient and on top of it, we also had Destiny, the food runner every now and again and she was so sweet! My favorite person at this restaurant though was Jacque, the Manager. Holy smokes, that girl has got it down! She was so aware of what was going on around her, she was an advocate for her servers when they were busy and was making sure all of her guests were comfortable and well taken care of. We were there around sunset so it was busy and you would have never been able to tell. She was calm, polite and so so so friendly. Overall, the drinks were yummy, the food unique yet still comforting and the view was magnificent. On the pier there is a free tram every 15 minutes that drops you off right at the door so it was also easy to get to. HIGHLY recommend. PS - my wife is gluten free and they were well informed on what she could or could not have.

Although additional tipping is not expected, it is greatly appreciated and goes 100% to the server/bartender. This brought your grand total to $13.27\n\nWe hope this makes sense!

We were able to relax on very comfortable lounge chairs overlooking the bay. The food is fun and high quality and best when shared! \n\nThe best item on the menu were the cheese stuffed yucca bites. Those are absolutely delicious! \n\nThe chicken wings are good - pretty much what you would expect. \n\nThe flatbreads are decent but are lacking sauce and flavor. \n\nThe chips and dip are good. They have guacamole and queso that is perfect for a nice snack. \n\nThe lobster chorizo empanadas are tasty but very heavy. \n\nThe service is quite slow, so plan to stay there for a while. But with great views and comfortable chairs, this wasn’t a problem for us at all. \n\nOverall, highly recommend!

Breathtaking and Beautiful! Blessed with sunny weather. So, we wanted to eat. And found Pier Teaki way upstairs. First we took a picture at the Tiki photo op, and we wanted to sit waterfront. Our server Laura was so charming...she made us feel at home. So I had a local lager beer and my daughter a margarita. Tasty. She had the fish tacos and I had the cuban flatbread. It was abundant and delicious. And it was lunch hour which is our favorite mealtime. I highly recommend Pier Teaki to everyone, and for that tropical feel and ambiance come at lunchtime. I want to come again, because we loved it. Read more Written April 12, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Black Bean Burger looked like it had been sitting under the warming light way too long and was dried out. The Peterburger was ordered Med Well and was more Med Rare (see pics). The bun was cold and hard on top and the bottom was soaked in juice, so it fell apart when picked up.  The sweet potato fries for both orders were cold.  \n\nGabi was a great server and tried her best to overcome the shortcomings in the kitchen. The manager brought some hot fries and apologized for the kitchen errors, which at least showed that they were open to feedback.\n\nOverall, the new St Pete Pier was extremely Underwhelming! After so many years and so many millions of dollars, we were extremely disappointed, as we were hoping for an iconic structure like the Sydney Opera House.

I’ll never pay by card ever again there.\n\nThe staff…I’ve never been greeted or welcomed…the small niceties that all other bars/restaurants welcome their guests with, and that’s every time.

We were told to use a 3D bar code on the table to look at a menu...20 minutes later, we were told it only works with iPad/iPhone.... UGH!  We got drinks just fine, but, when we were given a menu, no one ever checked back to see if we wanted to order anything.  Absurd.  The menu doesn't have any items for health conscious people.  All fried, cheesy, bready items.  We got out of there as fast as we could.  Total waste of time/money.

The end result looks good – many thanks. ADRIAN SHAH-CUNDY, VOLKER WESSELLS All looks fantastic thank you!! The guys were a pleasure to meet and it was all so hassle free. CHARLOTTE WALTERS, TUNGSTEN NETWORK Commissioned Logovisual to design and install a folding wall in one of our technology rooms. Both our company and the NHS Trust were absolutely delighted with the installation a first for all. PETER SALT, IMMERSIVE Clear and prompt communication throughout and a very smooth installation process. Nothing was too hard. Highly recommended! TRACEY COVE, STEVENS & COVE Excellent, high quality product, purchased after wise advice and installed quickly by friendly installers. Perfect product for our meeting room needs. MIA ELLIOTT, DIOCESE OF GUILDFORD The board looks great! And I’d like to say your installers were absolutely fantastic, so friendly, organised and cleaned up. JESS MARTIN, VAYNERMEDIA Logovisual really understood our brief and made some great suggestions to make our designs come to life. They helped us bring a child’s game from a small tin to a life size piece of experiential, for us to take in to store at John Lewis. Everyone loved it. Thank you guys. TAMARA SPURWAY, WILD & WOLF As a product, they really provide a varied functionality to aid in our brainstorming and project works. These mobile whiteboards have really been an excellent investment and are immensely popular with our staff. SEBASTIAN FRANCIS-JONES, C SPACE The whole process from start to finish was excellent and the final product was second to none. Highly recommend Logovisual and the team and will be using them again very soon for the next project. LYNNE BRODA, OXFORD CARTOGRAPHERS The install was fab the guys were excellent and we all love the wall, so much in fact we are thinking of future projects including them. Once again can’t thank you enough for a great thorough service. ZOE HARRIS, CBRE GLOBAL INVESTORS Logovisual had as I believed to be the simplest and hassle free job on the project, install of white boards. They were in and out within 3 hours, a job well done! THE PROJECT TEAM, OVERBURY PLC The product itself is superbly built and easy to manoeuvre around with the attached wheels. From the office team’s communication before our event to the delivery team’s installation and pickup I found everyone to be really helpful and very professional going out of their way to meet our deadlines. I would certainly recommend logovisual. SHAUN O’HARA, SAATCHI & SAATCHI WELLNESS We were looking for a new “canvas” to share information and encourage joint thinking. The Thinking Wall turned out to be the perfect solution. There’s room to be expansive and for things to have real impact. The service we received right from our first enquiry, to installation (very fast, very painless) has been excellent. STEPHEN CROWE, SCOTTISH FUNDING COUNCIL We were pleased with the high level of customer service, our order was dealt with quickly and efficiently and we are thrilled with the finished product. The custom whiteboards that are exactly as we had envisaged them. STEVE CROSTHWAITE, HOTSPUR PRIMARY SCHOOL Just wanted to thank you again for your help, had a small amount of feedback from our client: Whiteboards are superb. Even better than expected!
