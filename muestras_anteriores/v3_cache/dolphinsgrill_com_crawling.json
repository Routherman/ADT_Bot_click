Mandatory Credit: Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports NFL Miami Dolphins Coaches: Who Is on Mike McDaniel’s Coaching Staff? June 28, 2024 | 12:05 PM EDT Can Mike McDaniel and the Miami Dolphins coaches return to the postseason again? While QB Tua Tagovailoa ’s health issues never reared their head, losses on the defense down the stretch and inconsistent performances from the offense hindered Miami’s postseason success. After parting ways with some substantial pieces, the Dolphins retooled the roster and coaching staff to improve their shortcomings. Here are the coaches in charge of leading Miami to another playoff berth. Miami Dolphins Coaching Staff Mike McDaniel , Head Coach Eric Studesville , Associate Head Coach/Running Backs Jon Embree , Assistant Head Coach/Tight Ends Frank Smith , Offensive Coordinator Darrell Bevell , Quarterbacks/Passing Game Coordinator Chandler Henley, Senior Offensive Assistant Wes Welker, Wide Receivers/Pass Game Specialist Butch Barry , Offensive Line Lemuel Jeanpierre, Assistant Offensive Line Rob Everett, Offensive Assistant Parks Frazier, Offensive Assistant Max McCaffrey, Offensive Assistant Jonathan Krause , Offensive Assistant Roman Sapolu, Offensive Assistant Anthony Weaver, Defensive Coordinator Austin Clark , Defensive Line Kynjee’ Cotton, Assistant Defensive Line Joe Barry, Linebackers/Run Game Coordinator Ryan Crow, Outside Linebackers Brian Duker , Passing Game Coordinator/Secondary Mathieu Araujo, Cornerbacks Ryan Slowik, Defensive Backs/Pass Game Specialist Deshawn Shead , Assistant Defensive Backs Sean Ryan, Defensive Assistant Matt O’Donnell, Defensive Assistant Danny Crossman, Special Teams Coordinator Ronnie Bradford, Senior Special Teams Assitant New Additions to the Miami Dolphins’ Coaching Staff The most significant change on the Dolphins’ coaching staff is a shuffle on the defense. Vic Fangio was one and done in Miami after the defensive coordinator took a job with the Philadelphia Eagles in the offseason. The Dolphins hired former NFL DE and Ravens defensive line coach Anthony Weaver to take over the defense. Weaver was drafted by the Ravens in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft after spending his collegiate career at Notre Dame. He became a coach in 2010 and has worked with five other NFL franchises, mainly as a defensive line coach.

Miami also hired former Detroit Lions defensive backs coach Brian Duker as the Dolphins’ secondary coach and pass game coordinator. Additionally, Miami hired veteran coach Joe Barry, who will be the linebackers coach and tasked as the run game coordinator. Barry has been a defensive coordinator or positions coach in the NFL and college football since 1996. Furthermore, Weaver and the Dolphins brought in Tennessee Titans outside linebackers coach Ryan Crow to serve in the same position for Miami. While Crow spent six seasons with the Titans, Tennessee’s decision to part ways with Mike Vrabel also pushed Crow to search for new opportunities. He’ll partner with Jalean Phillips and Bradley Chubb following their injury rehab.
