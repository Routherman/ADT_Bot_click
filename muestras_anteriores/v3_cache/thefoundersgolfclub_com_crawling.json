The Founders Club was established in 1981 by a group of petrochemical industry executives who led the development of the petrochemical industry, particularly in the United States, from such modest beginnings. These industry leaders participated in the establishment of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) previously known as NPRA which ultimately generated the International Petrochemicals Conference (IPC) as a separate identity within AFPM. The Founders Club proudly advances the legacy we inherited from these \"founders\" as contributing stewards of the petrochemical industry. We look forward to advancing both the opportunities and the recognition for the petrochemical industry as well as for the individual members who have distinguished themselves over the years. JOIN US NOW America/Chicago The Founders Club Fall 2025 Golf Tournament October 22, 2025 8:30 AM Gleannloch Pines Golf Club, Spring, TX 2025 Founders Club Annual Golf Tournamen t 2025 Annual Meeting and Dinner Th e Founders Club held its Annual Dinner and Reunion on March 22, 2025, in at the Hilton Palacio del Rio in San Antonio, TX to tend to annual business and recognize this year’s Petrochemical Heritage Award nominee, Lori J. Ryerkerk, Retired Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Celanese Corporation.  The 2025 Annual Dinner set a record for the most members and guests registered at 124, which is almost a 15% over last year’s record attendance. The evening started with a cocktail reception sponsored by AFPM. Events Committee Co-Chair, Robert Sawchuk, called the meeting to order.  Sawchuk welcomed guests, the award nominee and past award winner, Gary Adams.  A short video was presented highlighting last year’s events, including the annual dinner, cocktail reception, and golf tournament. After dinner, Sawchuk thanked the Platinum Sponsors AFPM (cocktail reception sponsor) and Enterprise Products (dinner sponsor), as well as Gold Sponsors (OPIS a Dow Jones Company, NextWave Energy Partners, S&P Global, TPC Group and Westlake), Silver Sponsors (AmSty, Arcanum Infrastructure, Perin Resources and Trecora), and Bronze Sponsors (245Recycle and Petral Consulting). Sherman Glass, President of The Founders Club addressed the members and guests and recognized the Petrochemical Heritage Award committee members from AFPM and the Science History Institute in attendance.  Glass welcomed the new members in attendance and recognized all 36 new members – a record for new members.  He spoke of the election results, with returning board members Kevin Fallon (Mitsubishi Corporation) returning for a one-year term and William (Bill) Wiesemann (retired, INEOS Oligomers) returning for a three-year term; and new members Julie Antley (ChevronPhillips Chemical) and Stephanie Bryars (Arcanum Infrastructure) joining the board. Glass took a moment to recognize Dr. Ted Pettijohn (Arcanum Infrastructure), who will step down after a decade of service, for his contributions to the Board of Governors and role as Dinner Committee Co-Chair.  After presenting Pettijohn with a plaque honoring his service, Glass announced the new Board of Governors, including Theresa Houston (Enterprise Products) who will become the new President of The Founders Club. Glass recognized Kevin Fallon, who will be stepping down next year, for his decade long service on the Board of Governors and 7-years at Treasurer of The Founders Club.  Fallon was presented a plaque for his service. In a surprise twist, Houston interrupted Glass to present him with a plaque honoring his service to The Founders Club, including his role as President which he held from 2021 though 2025. Before introducing this year’s Petrochemical Heritage Award nominee, Glass wrapped up his remarks by announcing the upcoming events, including Cocktails and Conversations (early September date with location to be announced) and the Annual Golf Tournament (October 22 at the Gleanloch Pines Golf Club in Spring, TX). Ryerkerk began her remarks commenting on the people who dreamed and the believers who thought we could make the world a better place.  She said that she was a bored student until discovering math.  She thanked her 7 th grade teacher for being an inspiration, which led her to start taking calculus in the 10 th grade.  Ryerkerk spoke about leaving high school for community college, then on to Exxon where she called the refineries, “… a toy box for a new chemical engineer.”  She spoke of the challenges being a young woman in a male driven industry and the support she had throughout her career.  “We need someone in our corner,” she said when discussing her confidence to move to Celanese.  Ryerkerk concluded by encouraging the audience to support those early in their careers, just as she had throughout her career. Houston, newly appointed President of The Founders Club, made a few brief comments and adjourned the 2025 Annual Dinner and Reception. HONOREES THE   PETROCHEMICAL HERITAGE AWARD The Petrochemical Heritage Award  was established in 1997. The award recognizes those whose contributions to public understanding are noteworthy, who have displayed significant entrepreneurship in the petrochemical profession or industry, and who have been active in philanthropic and/or communal affairs. The award  recipient  is chosen jointly by the Founders Club, the Science History Institute (formerly the Chemical Heritage Foundation), and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), formerly known as NPRA .

The inaugural meeting was held in Stanley Hall on Saturday 21st February 1920. Mr T. Taylor (later Sir Thomas Taylor) was elected to the Chair and officers were appointed. The President was Mr J.R. Remer M.P., Captain, Mr T. Taylor, the Hon. Treasurer Mr E.J. Gibbon and Hon. Secretary, Mr H. Harrison. On 21st October 1920 it was reported in the Manchester Guardian that \"Good progress is being made with the ambitious scheme of the new Prestbury and Upton Golf Club, and it is hoped that half of the eighteen holes course will be ready for play later in the year, which, as actual work was only begun in July, is quite satisfactory. Mr. H.S. Colt who, with Dr McKenzie, is responsible for the design, made an inspection on Tuesday, and he repeated his previously expressed view, even more enthusiastically, that the course when completed will compare favourably  with that of the Torkington club. He also said that he knew of no other inland course where there was so much sand, and that this, in addition to its intrinsic value of £1,000 to the Club, would ensure a very dry winter course for the members when most golfers were suffering from 'mud and misery'.\" On the advice of Mr Colt, Messrs Frank Harris & Company were given the contract to lay out the course and 9 holes were ready for play on Easter Sunday, 26th March 1921. Harry Colt is credited with the design, construction and remodeling of over 300 courses worldwide in all six inhabited continents. These include some of the most famous layouts in the world such as; Pine Valley and Old Elm (USA), Royal County Down and Royal Portrush (Northern Ireland), Muirfield and the Eden Course at St. Andrews (Scotland), Royal Lytham and St. Anne’s, Sunningdale Old and New Courses, Swinley Forest, St George’s Hill, Royal Liverpool, Wentworth East and West Courses, Rye, Woodhall Spa, Ganton and Hankley Common (England), Royal Porthcawl (Wales), County Sligo (Ireland), Toronto and Hamilton (Canada), Koninklijke Haagsche, Utrecht de Pan, Kennemer, Eindhoven and Hilversumsche (Netherlands), Saint Germain and Le Touquet La Mer (France), Hamburger Falkenstein (Germany) and Royal Zoute (Belgium). You can find out more about Harry Colt here https://evalu18.com/architects/harry-colt/ . Colt apparently saw it as his primary task to work with the curves of nature and to make courses appear part of the existing countryside. Artificiality and symmetrical hazards were avoided at all costs. Founded in 1920 with all 18 holes officially opened for play in 1924 (a brief period when Harry Colt, Charles 'Hugh' Alison and Dr Alister MacKenzie were partners), his work at Prestbury does just that. The course makes the most of the dramatic changes in elevation afforded by the undulating terrain. The nature of the site coupled with the sandy subsoil means that the course drains exceptionally well and, unlike many others in the area, hardly ever closes due to heavy rainfall. By 1923 Dr MacKenzie had left the firm. He was replaced in 1928 by John Morrison creating Colt, Alison and Morrison Limited. MacKenzie went on to design more than 50 courses in four continents including 3 that remain in the top 10 golf courses in the world; Augusta National Golf Club and Cypress Point Club, both in the USA, and Royal Melbourne Golf Club (West Course) in Australia. The layout at Prestbury is outstanding, especially when considering the comparatively small scale of the site. The back nine is routed around the front nine in a horse shoe like fashion with the 6th green and holes 7 and 8 being the open ended part of the shoe. Interestingly, the back nine covers the highest part of the property at the 10th tee and lowest part at the 12th green with an ease few architects could match. While the walk back up to the clubhouse involves some gentle climbing it never requires a long green to tee walk. In 1934 Colt said of Prestbury “Owing to the natural formation of the ground, the golf is, in my opinion, very interesting and the variety provided is excellent as every hole presents some distinct feature of an impressive character ... Prestbury affords an excellent test of the game, and it also provides ... a most enjoyable course to play over”. Constant advice from Colt continued throughout 1936 and 1937. In 1946 the Club Secretary, Mr R.B. Rawsthorn, wrote to Colt again but this time John Morrison replied saying \"I thank you for your letter which has been forwarded to me by Mr Colt, who has retired as he feels he is no longer up to golf course work, which quite often has to be carried out in inclement weather.\" Harry Colt died in 1951 and Hugh Allison a year later. John Morrison continued as the course architect until 1959 when Messrs Fred Hawtree and Sons were appointed to suceed him. The Hawtree Company remained the course architects until 2016, when Mackenzie & Ebert were appointed. Paul Turner, regarded by many as the World’s most knowledgeable Colt historian, recently visited the course and said “Prestbury has been top of my 'to see' list for too long now as I live in New York and it was a real pleasure to finally get to see the course. It is a very interesting course as it is routed over quite a small parcel of land – only about 90 acres and Colt certainly did a masterful job. Prestbury is the kind of club and course I would want to join (assuming that they would have me!) with a very friendly membership and a beautiful course full of variety and character that you would never get bored with.” You can find course reviews of Prestbury here https://evalu18.com/courses/prestbury-golf-club/ and here https://www.golfclubatlas.com/forum/index.php/topic,41833.msg889375.html#msg889375 . The club has hosted many county and national competitions, including the English Seniors Championship and Open Championship Regional Qualifying. Prestbury is usually in pristine condition and in July 2016 European Tour player David Horsey commented that the “Golf course is immaculate…virtually tour standard at the moment”. The delightful village of Prestbury, along with nearby Alderley Edge, is consistently ranked as one of the most desirable villages in the UK and is located within easy reach of Manchester city centre, the M6 and M56 motorways, Manchester Airport (without being under the flight path!) and the stunning Peak District National Park. As well as the course, the club is rightly proud of its 27-acre practice ground with purpose built grass tee, long and short game areas and indoor teaching facility. The envy of most other clubs! The club has a thriving social scene with regular functions for members held throughout the year. Five star quality catering is complimented by a fully stocked bar with a selection of local cask ales and fine wines. Members also benefit from reciprocity with 10 other great courses, including West Lancs, Conwy, Beau Desert and Lindrick, via the “passport scheme” and a further 40  courses via the Harry Colt Reciprocal Association. For the competitive golfer the club offers weekly competitions and inter-club matches for both men’s and ladies’ sections. There is also a thriving junior section. Society day on your calendar? Let us help. In fact, let us take care of every last detail. The quality of the course, the reputation of our catering and the friendly ambience of the club make Prestbury a favourite venue for society days, charity days, and corporate events.

In 1989 Gary Adams started Founders Club after leaving as the head of Taylor Made, a company he founded in 1978. Gary Adams(for more on Gary Adams https://progolfnow.com/2022/06/07/golf-entrepreneurs-gary-adams-metalwoods/ )  was considered the “founder” of the metal wood thus the name of the company Founders Club. Under Adams’ leadership Founders Club quickly became the number 2 Driver and Fairway wood (in use) on the PGA Tour behind Taylor Made. The company had a reputation for producing quality equipment and several Tour Players including Lee Janzen, Fred Funk, Curtis Strange, Dave Stockton, Lanny Wadkins, Tom Watson, and Hale Irwin among others played Founders Club equipment at various times in the 1990’s. During that stretch a Founders Club driver led the PGA Tour in Driving Accuracy for five consecutive years. The hallmark of Gary Adams designs were precision “Face Progression” and perfect “Bulge and Roll” coupled with the “Blind Bore” hosel which produces low spin rates, optimum launch angle and a penetrating ball flight for maximum distance. In addition to Gary Adams, Founders Club designers that went on to create an impact in the golf industry included Bob Vokey( for more on Bob Vokey https://www.vokey.com/nav/who-is-bob-vokey.aspx#) who later gained fame with Titliest and Jeff Sheets(for more on Jeff Sheets https://www.jeffsheetsgolf.com/founders-club---past-projects) who left Founders Club to be head of Research and Design with Top Flite and later with Golfsmith. Founders Club continues to hold true to the original pear shaped heads designed by Gary Adams along with adhering to his concepts of producing clubs with low spin rates and optimum launch angles. Over the last 3 decades, Founders Club has designed Golf Clubs, Carts, and Bags for every type player, from PGA Tour Winners to beginning golfers. We at Founders Club are proud of our tradition and look forward to the challenge of producing cutting edge products that golfers have come to expect out of Founders Club.
