The Chief of Staff Network has allowed me to build meaningful relationships with industry professionals, as well as learn from other Chiefs of Staff in a safe and productive space. Conor Sweeney Chief of Staff, Box The Chief of Staff Network has been an invaluable resource since the day I started the role. Through monthly sessions discussing CoS related topics, or just having a support group with shared experience, the community has been one of the centerpieces of my tenure as a Chief of Staff. Leland Chamlin Chief of Staff, Bowery Farming The Chief of Staff Network is the preeminent one-stop shop for impactful Chief of Staff resources, relationship building, and knowledge sharing. The talented members of this community provide invaluable job insights to one another, forging career-changing connections for years to come. Tyler Young Chief of Staff to the CFO, Braze The CoS Network brings a group of solution oriented minds together into an environment set up for collaboration and sharing of best practices. The role can be ambiguous and challenging- participating in this community of support means being able to share what you know and accelerate your impact as you lean on othersâ learnings. The experience has been an invaluable investment in my career. Mary Kate Sinha Chief of Staff at Plastiq This community has been a wonderful benefit to me personally as I've continued to grow in the role and coached others. Stephen Olmstead fmr VP, Chief of Staff at InVision This group is invaluable for anyone that wants to succeed at a scaling start-up in a Chief of Staff role. No matter what challenge is thrown at you in the role (and you will see it all), someone in the group has been through it and can provide great insight into how they tackled the issue. Mike Maseda Chief of Staff at Prompt I recently joined the Chief of Staff Network and have already made some amazing connections. When you're a chief of staff, you're often the only person in the company with that job title -- the COS Network has people in your shoes, and it's a great place for advice, brainstorming, and community. Highly recommend! David Burt Chief Of Staff at Atlantic Media The Chief of Staff Network has been a blessing as I ventured into a unique position that was new - not only for myself but also for SumUp. Having access to this community makes my life easier as weâre all facing similar challenges and can freely exchange on ideas and solutions. Jacques Hoerter Chief of Staff at SumUp I came across Chief of Staff Network when considering the CoS role for the first time and found the content about the role was so helpful, I immediately became a member when I officially started the position. The content and connections continued to be invaluable throughout my entire CoS journey, so much so that I was able to work myself out of the job and into a founder role faster than I anticipated.
