This part of NB has a unique and interesting history that will be celebrated with full-bodied and flavourful craft beers that will be tied to some of these stories. Flying Boats Brewing was an idea that started in the early 1990s when owner Marc Melanson returned from 10 years of working as an automotive engineer in several European countries. After an abundance of distinctive, regionally produced beers in Europe, returning to Canada was akin to stumbling upon an arid desert, with a lack of selection and variety to choose from. Hence started the process to see what North America could offer. The search for authentic locally produced craft beers was enjoyed during numerous business trips in the US and Canada. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Le surnom \"Flying Boats\" et les noms des bières, en général, rendent hommage à l'histoire des transports dans le sud-est du Nouveau-Brunswick, y compris ses débuts dans l'aviation, les chemins de fer, les navires et bateaux, ainsi que les voyages par la route. Cette région du Nouveau-Brunswick possède une histoire unique et intéressante qui sera célébrée à travers des bières artisanales riches en corps et en saveurs, liées à certaines de ces histoires. Flying Boats Brewing était une idée qui a commencé au début des années 1990 lorsque le propriétaire Marc Melanson est revenu après avoir travaillé dix ans comme ingénieur automobile dans plusieurs pays européens. Après avoir découvert une abondance de bières distinctives produites localement en Europe, revenir au Canada était comme se retrouver dans un désert aride, avec un manque de choix et de variété à disposition. C'est ainsi qu'a commencé le processus pour découvrir ce que l'Amérique du Nord pouvait offrir. La recherche de bières artisanales authentiques produites localement a été appréciée lors de nombreux voyages d'affaires aux États-Unis et au Canada. Over the years, more and more selection of locally produced craft beers appeared on the market as well as new beer styles that emerged for different tastes. This coincided with the desire to channel his drive and passion into creating fresh locally produced – Maritime inspired craft beers. When a buddy said, “You should offer this to the public” – the gears started to turn and the long days and countless hours to create great tasting craft beers started and the passion has been driving the perfection of locally produced craft beer ever since. Flying Boat Brewing started in our garage in June 2015 and was licensed under a 2 BBL system, after several years of home brewing and developing new recipes. We expanded to a new 15 Barrel Brewhouse in January 2018, with a small canning line, and a fully licenced Taproom, offering beer flight samples, pints, plus growler fills and 473 mL cans to go. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au fil des années, de plus en plus de choix de bières artisanales produites localement ont fait leur apparition sur le marché, ainsi que de nouveaux styles de bières adaptés à différents goûts. Cela a coïncidé avec le désir de canaliser son dynamisme et sa passion dans la création de bières artisanales inspirées par les Maritimes, fraîchement produites localement. Lorsqu'un ami a dit : \"Tu devrais proposer ça au public\", les rouages ont commencé à tourner et les longues journées et les heures innombrables pour créer des bières artisanales au goût exceptionnel ont commencé, et la passion continue de perfectionner la bière artisanale produite localement depuis lors. Flying Boat Brewing a débuté dans notre garage en juin 2015 et a obtenu une licence pour un système de 2 barils (BBL), après plusieurs années de brassage amateur et de développement de nouvelles recettes. Nous avons déménagé vers une nouvelle brasserie de 15 barils en janvier 2018, avec une petite ligne de mise en canettes, et un bar à bières entièrement licencié, proposant des échantillons de dégustation, des pintes, ainsi que des remplissages de growlers et des canettes de 473 mL à emporter. +1 (506) 857-0537 info@flyingboatsbrewing.com 700 Malenfant Blvd Dieppe NB, Canada E1A 5V8 Google Sites Report abuse Page details Page updated Google Sites Report abuse"

Step inside, and you’re greeted by an artfully curated interior: subtle aviation motifs, industrial-chic exposed brick, and vintage propeller replicas lend a nod to days past while keeping the space lively and modern. The tap room stands out for its thoughtful selection of craft beers, favoring both local microbreweries and specialty imports. Beer flights cater to the adventurous, while knowledgeable staff guide newcomers on a curated tasting journey. Community tables, ample natural light, and adaptive lounge areas make it an ideal space for informal gatherings or solo reflection.

After graduating from Connecticut College in 2015, she started at Merrill Lynch in private wealth management. Cecily came back to CRBC full time in 2017 and has been loving planning events and working on board the six different boats ever since. Her favorite part about the job is working with clients to plan their events and watching them come to life alongside our amazing crew. When Cecily is not working, she loves spending time on the water with her husband, Ben, skiing, and playing pickleball with her friends. She is on the board of her high school, Holderness School, and is heavily involved with the Vincent Club, which supports Women’s Health at MGH. Gibson Cushman Director of Operations / Owner From a young age you could find Gibson crawling around the boats with his dad. His passion for boats and spending time on the water only continued to grow so it was no surprise that he got his 100 Ton Master Captain’s License as soon as he was eligible. One of Gibson’s favorite aspects of his job is working within a close-knit team environment, where everyone works together towards a common goal. He takes great pride in his work and enjoys sharing his knowledge and experience with his colleagues. Gibson has cruised on different boats all around the world but is happiest cruising the local waters around Boston. When Gibson isn’t on the water, you can find him spending time with his beloved puppy, Wallace. Gibson also loves to be outdoors, whether fishing, flying, skiing or hiking he is always up for an adventure! Russell Cushman Founder / Owner Russell founded the Charles River Boat Company in 1990 with his new bride Eliza. He had previously been the General Manager of the Seaport Cruise Line in New York City and the Spirit of Boston. Taking a pleasure boat trip on the Charles River in 1989, he was awed by the beauty and history of the Charles River and set out to start his own company. Today, the company has grown to six boats and has become a true family business. “I feel very grateful that we have had such great community and family support.” Eliza Cushman Founder / Florist Eliza helped Russell start the Charles River Boat Company in July 1990, the same summer they were married. With a background in retail management, Eliza started in charter sales building friendships with returning clients. After 3 years in sales, she stepped out to raise three children and volunteer her time with schools, church and Children’s Hospital fundraising. In recent years, Eliza has returned to lead our floral design team, and creates beautiful flower arrangements on all of the boats! Office Operations Kelley Bresnahan Controller Kelley has worked for Charles River Boat Company since graduating from Salem State College with a degree in Business Administration in 1995.

Ella Stahl Office Operations & Human Resources Assistant Growing up on Long Island, Ella learned how to cast a fishing pole almost before she learned to walk. With a captain for a dad, she spent most of her childhood on the water, picking up all the little things that come with growing up around boats.

During college, Ella began working at a catering hall, where she quickly found her passion for events and operations.

Dayna Linehan Assistant Director of Sales With her background in musical theatre, Dayna always knew she wanted to create amazing experiences. It wasn’t until she started planning her own wedding that she realized events were just like putting on a show. When you hit the right mix of emotion, design and personal touch, the magic happens! This connection mixed with her extensive background in bar management in both New York City and Los Angeles led her to finding her place in the event industry here in Boston. Working for a catering company allowed her to hone in on her food and beverage knowledge and she is now thrilled to put this to use with events out on the water. While weddings are how she started, Dayna loves any reason to party. There is nothing better than celebrating something special with great food, amazing drinks and a busy dancefloor!

After graduating with a degree in Managing for Sustainability from McGill University in Montreal, she moved to Boston and joined our team in 2021. Georgie has loved weddings for as long as she can remember!
