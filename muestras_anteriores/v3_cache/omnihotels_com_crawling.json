It is the intent of the officers and directors to limit those rules and regulations so that everyone will obtain maximum use and enjoyment of the facilities. Enforcement of these rules and regulations will be primarily placed in the hands of carefully selected staff, whose principal responsibility is to assure you of all the courtesies, comforts and services to which you are entitled. It is the responsibility of those using facilities to know their rules and regulations and to cooperate with the officers, directors and staff in the enforcement of the rules. Please notify the participants in your group of these policies. ChampionsGate Country Club Dress Code Policy In staying with the true spirit of the game, proper attire is required including collared shirts and NO denim. The Country Club at ChampionsGate (thereafter called the Club) strictly enforces these policies. Any participant that does not comply with the dress code policy will need to change into the proper attire or will not be able to participate in the day’s play. The Club has a variety of slacks, shorts, and outerwear for sale in our golf shop should participants need to purchase proper attire on the day of play. Non Metal Spike Policy The Club is also a non-metal spike facility. Any participant that has not converted their shoes to some form of non-metal footwear will have the following options: purchasing new shoes from the Club’s Golf Shop, or wearing tennis shoes as an alternative. Pace of Play The Club’s goal is to have 18-hole rounds completed in four hours and twenty minutes or less. At times, golf outings tend to spend a little more time on the golf course, regardless of size, or golf experiences. In order to create an enjoyable experience for everyone on the golf course, we ask each group to keep pace with the with the group in front of you. The Club schedules daily course hosts to assist players in keeping pace to assure every player experiences an enjoyable round. The Club is very knowledgeable in the organization of golf outings. We look forward to discussing the proper start times and formats to assure your group has an enjoyable experience during their special day. House Rules Mission It is our mission to provide members and their guest an exceptional experience. General Information The house rules of The Club are designed to protect the rights and privileges of members of the Club, their families and guests and to protect club property. The rules have been formulated to acquaint the members of the Club with the services available to them and the proper utilization of the facilities. Member Privileges Member of the Association — Every owner of a lot, unit or parcel shall be a member of the Association and be entitled to the enjoyment of the Common Area. Members of the Golf Course — One individual for each lot or unit shall be considered the member of the Golf Club. A spouse and children under 21 years of age who reside in the unit shall be entitled to the use of the Golf Course. Delegation of Privileges Any owner may delegate their right of enjoyment to the Common Area and facilities to his/her tenants provided a completed delegation form signed by the owner is submitted to the office, a processing fee is paid and the transfer is in accordance with the policies set by the Board of Directors. During the period specified on the delegation form, minimum of one month, the owner’s privileges are rescinded. The transferee must be renting and residing in the unit for which the privileges are delegated. Privileges for the use of the Golf Course are delegated to one individual. That individual, his (or her) spouse and children under 21 are entitled to the use of the Golf Course. Any delegation proceeded by The Country Club at ChampionsGate which is not in accordance with the policies outlined above will be rescinded immediately. In addition, a fee equal to the current guest fee will be charged to the owner of the unit involved for each round of golf played under the illegal delegation. Service Slow, unsatisfactory or improper service or any inattention to duty should be reported immediately to the manager on duty. Complaints of all deficiencies in service will receive the immediate attention of the manager. We welcome all comments. Suggestions or concerns relating to the Club facilities or services should be brought to the attention of the Club Manager. Employees of the Club Members, transferees and guests are to be respectful of Club employees and are not permitted to reprimand Club employees or in any way interfere with the management of the Club. Serious complaints regarding specific employees should be made in writing addressed to the Club Manager who will notify the Board of Directors and the complaining member of the corrective action, if any was taken. Use of the Club Members, transferees and guests shall at all times conduct themselves in an orderly fashion as ladies and gentlemen. Proper attire is to be worn at all times in accordance with acceptable practice for the particular area of the Club. Subscriptions, petitions, or notices not concerning Club affairs shall not be distributed or posted on any Club property without approval of the Head Golf Professional. Parents are responsible for the conduct of their children at all times. The cost of replacing any property of the Club, broken, damaged or removed by a member, transferee, guest or any member of their families shall be charged to the member or transferee concerned. No food or beverage shall be brought into the Clubhouse or consumed on Club premises unless purchased from the Club. All decorations for private parties, other than table centerpieces, must have the approval of the Club Manager. Animals are not permitted in the Clubhouse or golf course. The parking areas are marked in a manner which permits maximum use with a minimum of inconvenience. Anyone found parking improperly will be warned, but repeated infractions will result of the removal of the offending vehicle at the owner’s expense. Aqua Range The practice facility at CGCC is a water based facility with floater balls. Practice balls are available for use with a tee time only. Golf Course Rules In setting these rules for the use of the Golf Course, the management is in no way attempting to restrict the enjoyment obtained from playing our course. It is; however, necessary to follow certain procedures to ensure maximum enjoyment and safety to all golfers. It is hoped that pride in our Club, together with the thoughtfulness and consideration we afford our fellow golfers, will make enforcement of any rules unnecessary. The rules of golf from the United States Golf Association (USGA) govern play. The use of the Golf Course is supervised by the Head Golf Professional. Without exception, all players must register at the golf shop before playing the Golf Course. The Head Golf Professional and Golf Course Superintendent shall determine when the course conditions prohibit play. All play must start on designated Number 1 tee unless otherwise directed by the golf shop staff. No more than four players per group are permitted unless authorized by the golf shop staff. Practice golf activities shall be limited to those areas of the golf course designated for such activities. Practice is prohibited to, or on, regular greens and fairways of the golf course. The Head Golf Professional, may establish certain days and times during which the course shall be reserved for men’s and women’s golf days and special events. All paper, bottles, cans and other trash should be placed in a trash receptacle. Each player must have a set of clubs and a golf bag when playing the course. No coolers are allowed on the Golf Course unless supplied by the club. Ball hawking is not permitted at any time. Damage to any private property, outside the boundaries of the golf course, caused purposely or by accident, shall be the responsibility of the person causing the damage. Golf Cart Operation Individuals operating carts must have a valid driver’s license. Carts restricted to two riders and two bags. During normal operating conditions, the 90-degree rule is always in effect. Carts are to remain on cart paths until reaching a point adjacent to where the ball lies. At that point, carts may be driven across fairway directly to the ball and should return to the cart path on the same line after the shot has been played. The Golf Professional and Golf Course Superintendent shall determine when golf cart operation is prohibited or restricted to paths only. Carts must remain on the cart path on par 3s at all times. The driver of the cart always assumes responsibility for returning the cart in the same condition. Driver is also responsible for any damage that occurs through operation of the vehicle. Carts are never permitted on the shoulder or surface of any tee, green or bunker. The roped areas indicate the superintendent restricted areas for cart traffic. Exception: When handicap flag policy is in effect.** **HANDICAP FLAG POLICY The Club offers the use of Handicap Flags for golf carts for those individuals who, for medical reason, will benefit from their use. A golfer who submits a valid handicap parking permit from any government agency may be extended this privilege. Handicap Flag privileges may be suspended or revoked, with or without warning, for abuser of this policy. Rules of the Flag The Handicap Golf Cart may be driven up to the green or tee. AT NO TIME should a Handicap Golf Cart be parked or driven on the green or tee. NO CARTS are allowed beyond the boundary of the course which is defined by out-of-bounds stakes. In case of inclement weather or certain golf course conditions, carts may be restricted to the cart paths. NO HANDICAP PRIVILEGE will be extended for that time. If cart path only is limited to select holes, Handicap Privilege will NOT be extended for those holes so designated. Handicap flag privileges are extended only to the person who has submitted valid documentation and has been approved for its use. This privilege does NOT extend to an additional cart rider or spouse that is not registered within the Handicap Flag Program. The Ranger/Starter has absolute authority for all traffic control. If a player refuses to abide by the rules of the day (as stated above), his/her Handicap Flag Privileges may be suspended after review by the Golf Professional. The Club Pro Shop is happy to extend this privilege to those golfers who qualify and will benefit from its use. These rules and regulations are being distributed to clarify any misinterpretation by any golfer. Tee Time Policies Members can make tee times 14 days in advance. Annual Passholders can make tee times 10 days in advance. Annual Passholders can make tee times beginning at 8:30 am. Notice of cancellation needs to be made 48 hours in advance to avoid a charge for a full rate green fee. Players may not reserve more than one individual tee time slot per player name. Players must be ready to commence play at their reserved starting time or risk losing their privilege to play that day and being subject to charge(s) for full rate green fee(s).  If a player or players are late, the Club will try to accommodate them with a later starting time if such is available on the tee sheet. Junior Play Children, 18 through 21 years of age, who reside with their parents are entitled to the same privileges as their parents. The Director of Golf may waive restrictions for juniors provided they are able to assure the Golf Professional that they have adequate knowledge of golf rules and golf etiquette. Golf Courtesy and Etiquette Golf is a game where courtesy and etiquette should always be observed. The following policies should be strictly adhered to for the maximum enjoyment of everyone using the golf course. Please repair ball marks on greens and sand divots in fairways. Please rake your tracks leaving a sand bunker. After finishing a hole, place the flag in the hole and leave the green area immediately. Proceed to the next tee, do not remain parked along the side of the green; mark your scores at the next tee. Please be respectful of private property surrounding the golf course. Under no circumstances shall electric carts be driven on, or any shot played from, other than golf course property. Slow Play — Players are required to maintain a pace of play that keeps them up with the group in front of them. Rangers and/or Pro Shop Staff consistently monitor the speed of play and are required to enforce the following policy for the pleasure and enjoyment of the entire field: First Offense: The group has fallen behind the group in front of them and has fallen behind the allotted time limit for their position on the course. The ranger will indicate your group is out of position and that you need to catch up to the group in front. Second Offense: The group has not improved their position. The ranger will approach the group and inform them of their second warning and that the next offense will require them to skip an entire hole. Third Offense: The group has been warned properly and has not improved their position. The ranger will escort the group to the next hole. Inexperienced golfers are asked to refrain from playing during peak times of the day. Golf Handicaps A golf handicap service is provided for members and transferees. To establish an accurate and legitimate handicap, players are requested to post scores after each complete round of golf. To be eligible for tournament play, an authorized USGA handicap may be required as deemed necessary by the Director of Golf. Ball Hawking Procedure First Offense: Request by Club Personnel to discontinue ball hawking. Second Offense: Form letter from the Director of Golf quoting the “Rules and Regulations” booklet and notify a wrongdoer of future action if ball hawking continues. Third Offense: Suspending of golf privileges for a period of two (2) weeks. Fourth Offense: Length of suspension for use of all common areas will be determined by the Board of Directors. Disciplinary Action Because there are always a few individuals who will not always observe these rules, the following infractions will be brought to the attention of the Board of Directors for disciplinary action: Repeated violation of Club rules or knowingly violating a Club rule. Display of temper or other discourteous conduct resulting in damage to club property or physical damage. Disrespect shown to Club employees or fellow members, transferees or guests. Personal use of driving range balls on the Golf Course. Failure to register guests when playing the Golf Course.

I am a member of Mid Herts Golf Club, where I thoroughly enjoy playing golf and attending the various social events.  I would call myself an active member and like to offer support to the club whenever I can, whether that’s by organising events or helping out in the background. I was Lady Captain in 2016. I have served on two golf boards of management – at Mid Herts (2008 to 2011) and at Arkley Golf Club (late ‘90s). My marketing and communications career spanned 30 years,  including 12 as Head of Public Relations at Tesco and eight as Head of Communications for the department of Children, Schools and Families at Hertfordshire County Council.  I also successfully ran my own PR business for nine years. Karen Bond - Director of Player Development I was appointed to the Hertfordshire Golf Board in November 2021 which coincided with my retirement after a 43-year career with a major global financial institution. During that time, I held a number of senior roles in Sales, Relationship Management and most recently Operational Risk. I qualified as an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers and the Association of Corporate Treasurers. I started as a Director without Portfolio but in early 2025 I took over the role of Player Development Director. I am a member of East Herts Golf Club where I am the Captain of the Scratch B Team. I am also a member of Mill Green Golf Club in Welwyn Garden City and have been since it first opened in 1993. I am one of the Club Ambassadors there, a role that acts as liaison between the members and management and assists with their charitable endeavours. I am married to Bob who is also a member of East Herts and Mill Green and I have a son, Joseph, who is currently studying Geography at Newcastle University. Jane Clarke  - Director of Club Engagement I have been playing golf at The Melbourne Club for 26 years and remain an active member. I currently sit on the Handicap Committee and had the pleasure of serving as Lady Captain in 2004. I was elected Club Services Director in 2023 after serving on that committee. I am also on the Marketing & Communications Committee as well as currently being the Pearson Manager for Hertfordshire. I gained my Banking professional qualifications in 1988 but left that behind to raise my family. Rowena Hemmings - Director of Golf Development In 2006 I was a founder member of Herts Golf Partnership, now known as Herts Golf Development. As Development Director I have special responsibility for introducing people of all ages to golf, including people with disabilities. From 2000 to 2005 I was Junior Area Manager for South East Division 1 (Berkshire, Buckingham and Oxfordshire, Hampshire and Hertfordshire), reporting back to England Golf. I was County Captain and 1st team Captain from 2005 to 2007 and have served on the HCLGA committee for many years. I am a member of Porters Park Golf Club, where I have been Lady Captain, served on the Executive Committee as Chair of Golf and am currently on the Members & Golf Committee. Bobby Kendall  - Chair I was appointed Chair of Hertfordshire Golf in January 2021, having previously held the positions of Finance Director and Director Without Portfolio. I was Treasurer of the Hertfordshire Golf Union from 2016 until the 2018 merger. I am a member of Moor Park Golf Club, where I joined as a junior and currently serve on the General Committee. I enjoy travelling and playing other golf courses and I compete in a range of seniors’ tournaments. I completed a degree in Biochemistry at Birmingham University. In 1978 I qualified as a Chartered Accountant and worked for KPMG in London and Tokyo before moving into commercial finance roles. I was Finance Director for a range of companies over a period of 25 years, from start-ups to a large quoted company and then for number of governmental organisations, including Sport England. I am now retired. Louis Matamala - County and Company Secretary I started employment with the Hertfordshire Golf Union as County Secretary in October 2012 and on merger in 2018 my services were retained in the same role for the new body. Prior to that I worked for 3 years at Brocket Hall, which followed 6 years at the PGA East Region, based at Bishop’s Stortford Golf Club, as a Tournament Controller. I am also Hertfordshire’s representative on the Men’s South East Group Committee and the Local Handicapping Authority. I have been a member of Verulam Golf Club in St Albans since 1992 and have been a ‘Category 1’ handicap golfer since 1996. Liz Perrottet  - Director without Portfolio I was a member of Batchwood Hall Golf Club for over 30 years (left in 2023), and have been at Berkhamsted Golf Club since 1993. I served on both Ladies’ Committees, becoming Ladies’ Captain in 1996 (BHGC) and 2009 (BGC). I was elected to the Management Committee at Berkhamsted in 2012 and became Club Captain in 2016. I was Chair of the Golf Committee from 2017 to 2024, only retiring from that post on being honoured with the position of Club President. I have been a County Referee since 2012, and served on the County Championship Committee for several years, during which time I acted as Chief Referee for many events. My working life was as a peripatetic instrumental music teacher, and music is still a major part of my life today. Simon Shepherd - Director without Portfolio I am a Technology Company Director, based in the City. My background is in Property Finance and Investment Banking. I have a depth of knowledge and a variety of experience that I have brought to bear in my role as Director without portfolio. I have been a Member at Hadley Wood since August 1992 and have seen many changes in both the Club, the Course and its representation at Hertfordshire Golf. I want this evolution to continue and look forward to working with both the County Development Officer and Hadley Wood’s new Golf Operations Supervisor. I am keen to further my understanding of what Hertfordshire Golf does and to spread the good word about all its activities for all members of the golfing community, contributing when and where I can, as required by the Board. Alan Thomson -  Director of Championships As Director of Championships, I chair the Championship Committee which oversees the organisation of all Hertfordshire Golf competitions. Before the merger I was an elected member of the HGU Executive Committee, Chairman of its Championship Committee and the England Golf Voting Member. I was a member of the merger steering group and had previously organised the men’s Scratch League. I am a member of the England Golf Tournament Panel and have a Level 3 refereeing qualification. I act as either the Chief Referee or an on-course referee at many county events. A member of Verulam Golf Club since 1972, I spent time as an elected board member, served as Chairman of the Greens Committee and was Captain in 2005, the club’s centenary year. I am a former General Practitioner and was a partner in a St Albans practice for 20 years before taking early retirement in 2012.

I have been a member of Verulam Golf Club since 2005 having previously been a member of West Herts Golf Club, and have played extensively throughout the British Isles and overseas. At Verulam I am a Board Director since 2022 with lead responsibility for course matters. In my working career I have been Chief Executive of several not-for-profit organisations in the UK and overseas with responsibility to the Boards for leadership, strategy development and delivery, and finance.

Policies & Important Documents Rules of Golf Matters relating to the Rules of Golf are the responsibility of the HG Championships Committee (CC), under the leadership of the Director of Championships. Its activity includes: promoting the knowledge and understanding of the Rules of Golf throughout Hertfordshire clubs and amongst competitors in HG events producing a Hard Card at the start of each season, setting out the Local Rules that will apply to all HG events produces during the year. (This is likely to be closely aligned with the England Golf Hard Card for that season) working towards the target of having at least one person with an accredited knowledge of the Rules in every Hertfordshire club staging Rules Roadshows around the county to provide the opportunity for all HG affiliated members to learn about the Rules through practical demonstrations and discussion managing a team of qualified referees who officiate at all HG events Club officials may submit Rules queries to the County Secretary who will reply with the help of the members of the Committee Clubs are also encouraged to seek HG advice regarding their own Local Rules whenever necessary HG Rules Accreditation will be awarded to any affiliated member who attends a Rules Roadshow and subsequently score over 90% in the R&A online Level 1 Rules exam All HG referees have attained an R&A Level 2 qualification. Some have achieved Level 3 qualification. The CC ensures that referee qualifications are revalidated as required and upgraded when appropriate. Potential new referees are advised regarding the process for obtaining the relevant qualification and invited to shadow current referees at HG events.

It drives the calculation of a Handicap for all golfers and is a central feature of the new World Handicap System that is being introduced throughout 2020. The USGA Course Rating System takes into account the factors that affect the playing difficulty of a golf course. Course rating teams from Hertfordshire Golf carry out the on-course portion of the rating process across the county. England Golf reviews the work of the teams and then issues the ratings. Accuracy and consistency are the keys to effective course rating. A course must first be accurately measured. The measured yardage must then be corrected for the effective playing length. These effective playing length corrections are roll, elevation, dogleg/forced lay-up, prevailing wind, and altitude. Obstacles that affect playing difficulty must then be evaluated in accordance with established standards. These standards increase objectivity in course rating. Important Definitions The following are terms essential to the USGA Course Rating System: Scratch Golfer: A male scratch golfer is a player who can play to a Course Handicap of zero on any and all rated golf courses. A male scratch golfer, for rating purposes, can hit tee shots an average of 250 yards and can reach a 470-yard hole in two shots. A female scratch golfer is a player who can play to a Course Handicap of zero on any and all rated golf courses. A female scratch golfer, for rating purposes, can hit tee shots an average of 210 yards and can reach a 400-yard hole in two shots at sea level. USGA Course Rating:  A USGA Course Rating is the evaluation of the playing difficulty of a course for scratch golfers under normal course and weather conditions. It is expressed as the number of strokes taken to one decimal place (72.5), and is based on yardage and other obstacles to the extent that they affect the scoring difficulty of the scratch golfer. Bogey Golfer:   A male bogey golfer is a player who has a Course Handicap of approximately 20 on a course of standard difficulty. He can hit tee shots an average of 200 yards and can reach a 370-yard hole in two shots at sea level. A female bogey golfer is a player who has a Course Handicap of approximately 24 on a course of standard difficulty. She can hit tee shots an average of 150 yards and can reach a 280-yard hole in two shots. Bogey Rating:   A Bogey Rating is the evaluation of the playing difficulty of a course for bogey golfers under normal course and weather conditions. It is expressed as the number of strokes taken to one decimal place (92.1), and is based on yardage and other obstacles to the extent that they affect the scoring difficulty of the bogey golfer. Slope Rating: A Slope Rating is the USGA mark that indicates the measurement of the relative playing difficulty of a course for players who are not scratch golfers, compared to scratch golfers.  It is computed from the difference between the Bogey Rating and the USGA Course Rating times a constant factor and is expressed as a whole number from 55 to 155. The Rating Process The rating process requires a study of each hole, including detailed data obtained at all landing zones for both the scratch and the bogey golfer. The rating teams use the average shot lengths for both scratch and bogey golfers to determine the landing zones. Length corrections and obstacle values are considered at each landing zone. Effective Playing Length Factors The following correction factors are evaluated to determine if the hole is effectively longer or shorter than the actual measured length: Roll: Roll is an evaluation of how far full shots for scratch and bogey golfers roll, and the effect that has on the playing length of the course. For example, it considers whether a drive from the tee lands on a slope that is uphill or downhill. Elevation:  Elevation is a measure of how changes in elevation from tee to green affect the playing length of a hole. Dogleg/forced lay up: Dogleg/forced lay-up is a measure of how much longer or shorter a hole is played because it has a bend (allowing players to cut the corner or forcing them to lay up), or because it has obstacles, such as water or deep bunkers, crossing the fairway in the players’ landing zones (which force the scratch or bogey golfer to hit less than a full shot). Prevailing Wind:   Prevailing wind is a measure of the effect of constant wind on seaside courses, plains courses, or other courses unprotected from the wind. Altitude: Altitude is an evaluation for courses at 2,000 feet or more altitude that will play shorter than their measured length because shots fly farther in the thin air. Obstacle Factors The following obstacle factors are determined for each landing zone for both the scratch and the bogey golfer: Topography: is a factor if the stance or lie in the landing zone is affected by slopes or mounds, or the shot to the green is uphill or downhill, making club selection more difficult. Fairway: is an evaluation of the difficulty of keeping the ball in play from tee to green. Fairway ratings are based on fairway width in all landing zones, hole length, and nearby trees, hazards, and punitive rough. Green Target: is an evaluation of the difficulty of hitting the green with the approach shot. Primary considerations are green size, approach shot length, and green surface visibility, firmness, and contour. Recoverability and Rough: is the evaluation of the probability of missing the tee shot landing zone and the green, and the difficulty of recovering if either, or both, is missed. The Green Target rating drives the Recoverability and Rough rating value. Bunkers: is the evaluation of their proximity to target areas and the difficulty of recovery from them. The Green Target rating also drives the Bunkers rating value. Crossing Obstacles: consist of penalty areas, extreme rough and out of bounds. Ratings are based on the shot length required to safely carry the crossing obstacle. Lateral Obstacles: consist of penalty area, extreme rough and out of bounds. These are evaluated at each landing zone. The rating being based on shot length required to reach the landing zone and the distance of the lateral obstacle from the centre of the landing zone (fairway or green). Trees: is the evaluation of the size and density of the trees, their distance from the centre of the landing zone or green, the length of the shot to that target, and the difficulty of recovery. Green Surface: is the evaluation of a green’s difficulty from a putting standpoint. Green speed and surface contouring are the main factors. The size of the green is considered irrelevant in evaluating putting difficulty. A Stimpmeter is utilized to measure the speed of the greens based on midseason conditions. Psychological: is the evaluation of the cumulative effect of the other obstacles. The location of many punitive obstacles close to a target area creates uneasiness in the mind of the player and thus affects his or her score. This value is purely mathematical and is added after the on-course rating is complete. Each obstacle is assigned a value of 0 to 10, depending on its relation to how a scratch or bogey golfer would play the hole. When the evaluation is complete, the numbers for each hole’s obstacles are totalled and multiplied by a relative weighting factor. The weighted obstacle stroke values are applied to scratch and bogey formulas and then converted to strokes. Those strokes are added or subtracted from the Yardage Rating to produce a Bogey Rating and USGA Course Rating, and the difference between those two values multiplied by a constant factor is the Slope Rating. Courses must be re-rated at least every 10 years, or if it is a new golf course, within 5 years. If significant changes have been made to the course it will need to be re-rated. The club should notify the Hertfordshire Course Rating Team by emailing the course.rating@hertfordshiregolf.org giving details of the changes. Handicapping The County Secretary for Hertfordshire Golf is the delegated ‘County Handicap Advisor’ for all handicapping matters in Hertfordshire for all affiliated golf clubs and their members. The County Handicap Advisor acts under the overall authority of Hertfordshire Golf under its responsibilites as the Regional Association. England Golf as the National Governing Body have overall authority in all handicapping matters within England.
