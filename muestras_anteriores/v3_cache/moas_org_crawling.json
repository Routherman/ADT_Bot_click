To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level.\nThese guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible\nto all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more. This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific\ndisabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs. Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML,\nadapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email Screen-reader and keyboard navigation Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with\nscreen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive\na prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements,\nalongside console screenshots of code examples: Screen-reader optimization: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website.\n\tIn this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels;\n\tdescriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups),\n\tand others. Additionally, the background process scans all the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag\n\tfor images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology.\n\tTo turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on\n\tas soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside it. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. Disability profiles supported in our website Epilepsy Safe Mode: this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations. Visually Impaired Mode: this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others. Cognitive Disability Mode: this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily. ADHD Friendly Mode: this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions. Blindness Mode: this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a  computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it. Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments Font adjustments – users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more. Color adjustments – users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over seven different coloring options. Animations – person with epilepsy can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions. Content highlighting – users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only. Audio muting – users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly. Cognitive disorders – we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others. Additional functions – we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions. Browser and assistive technology compatibility We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers). Notes, comments, and feedback Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs. There may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements.

Museums on Us® Program Rules Each Bank of America® or Merrill Lynch® cardholder is allowed one free general admission to participating institutions on any eligible Museums on Us® day. Admission is non-transferable and for the cardholder only. Any valid Bank of America® or Merrill Lynch® credit or debit card is acceptable. Photo ID is required along with the card. Offer does not include free admission to the Lohman Planetarium, special exhibitions, or ticketed shows. Free admission does not guarantee reservations. The program applies to the first full weekend (consecutive Saturday and Sunday) of every month. Bank of America® and Merrill Lynch® associates are also eligible for free general admission to Museums on Us® weekends. They must present current proof of employment along with an additional photo ID. Museums on Us® FAQ's Are multiple children and family members granted free admission with the cardholder? No, only the individual cardholder receives one free admission with their Bank of America® or Merrill Lynch® credit or debit card and photo ID. What cards are accepted? All Bank of America® and Merrill Lynch® credit or debit cards are accepted for the Museums on Us® program (includes Bank of America-issued affinity cards). Can Bank of America® and Merrill Lynch® associates (employees) participate in Museums on Us®? Yes. Bank of America® and Merrill Lynch® associates (employees) can participate by presenting valid proof of employment and photo ID. What other forms of ID are needed? A photo ID, such as a driver's license or passport, will be required along with the necessary bank card or corporate ID. Does the offer include admission to the Lowell and Nancy Lohman Family Planetarium or special events and exhibitions? No, planetarium admission can be purchased separately from the complimentary admission. This offer does not extend to ticket shows, events, or exhibits that are not already included in museum admission. What is the policy for expired cards? Expired cards are not accepted. Cards must be valid and current. Does the list of participating museums ever change? Yes. While most museums will remain on the list, there will be additions and changes throughout the program. In addition, individual museum hours may change. It is very important to check the Museums on Us® website at museums.bankofamerica.com and consult individual museum websites when planning a visit. Museums for All® Through Museums for All, those receiving food assistance (SNAP benefits) can gain free or reduced admission to more than 600 museums throughout the United States simply by presenting their SNAP EBT (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Electronic Benefit Transfer) card. Museums for All is a national, branded access program that encourages individuals of all backgrounds to visit museums regularly and build lifelong museum habits. It is open to participation by any type of museum - including art, history, natural history/anthropology, and general museums, children's museums, science centers, planetariums, nature centers, historic houses/sites, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, and arboretums. The cost of museum admission can be a barrier for many low-income families. Participating museums provide reduced admission, ranging from free to $3.00, to visitors presenting their EBT card. This reduced rate is available during all normal operating hours to up to four individuals per EBT card. With a year-round open door policy, Museums for All invites low-income visitors to feel welcome at cultural institutions. Museums for All® FAQ's Do I need to register for anything? No. Visitors do not need to register for anything. You can just go to a participating museum, show your Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card or a Women Infant Children (WIC) card and a photo ID, and you will receive the Museums for All free admission rate. You can go back as many times as you wish - there's no limit. Do I pay with my SNAP EBT card? No, your SNAP EBT or WIC card is only for identification purposes, showing that you meet the criteria. Any admission costs must be paid for with alternate methods (cash, credit cards, etc.). I have one SNAP EBT card. How many people can get the Museum for All rate with that card? Each SNAP EBT or WIC card allows up to five people to get the Museums for All rate. Some of the participating museums will allow more than four to enter, so it is a good idea to check their individual policies ahead of time. Can I use my SNAP EBT card in another state? Yes! Museums participating in Museums for All will accept SNAP EBT cards from any state. If you live in one state, but want to visit a participating museum in a different state, you can!

Please follow the rules below so that future generations may enjoy them as well. Children 16 and under must be accompanied by an adult. NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY: The intensity of the light damages the art. Guests are welcome to take photographs for personal use throughout the Museum without the use of a flash unless indicated by signage regarding specific works of art. Please do not use flashes, tripods or video cameras. For commercial photography, please inquire with Museum staff. DO NOT TOUCH THE COLLECTION: Our hands contain harmful oils that react to the surface of sculpture, furniture, and paintings. Those oils corrode the surfaces of objects and lessen the life expectancy of the art. DO NOT LEAN ON THE CASES OR GALLERY WALLS: This helps keep works of art hung on the walls or displayed in cases safe. NO FOOD, DRINK, OR GUM IS ALLOWED IN THE GALLERIES: For maintenance and security reasons, food and beverages are not allowed inside of the galleries. Both museums provide areas for eating and drinking. NO BACKPACKS, LARGE BAGS, UMBRELLAS, OR SELFIE STICKS IN THE GALLERIES: These objects can often accidentally bump or scratch pieces from the collection. Allowances will be made for medical necessities. We advise leaving backpacks inside of your locked vehicle. CELL PHONES: As a courtesy to others, we ask that all visitors silence their cell phones. 2025 Exhibit Sponsors Sponsored in part by the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Arts and Culture, the Florida Council on Arts and Culture, and the National Endowment for the Arts.

If you are interested in gifting an object to the Museum of Arts & Sciences, please submit the following information to curatorial@moas.org with the subject heading “Object Donation Request – your first and last name .” Please note: Due to restrictions of limited funds, storage space, or concerns of an object’s required preservation needs, only inquiries which are of specific interest and in line with these criteria will be considered.
