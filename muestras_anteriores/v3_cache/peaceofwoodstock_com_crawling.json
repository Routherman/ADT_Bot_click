I am very pleased with this product! Woodstock Stage Artist Acrylic Frame Chris Cline Gift of a Peace of Music & Cultural History! I recently gifted a Peace of Stage to my brother, Scott. He has been a fan of both Woodstock and of The Grateful Dead for many, many years and I had been considering giving him one for a couple of years. Upon receiving his gift, his reaction was just as I had hoped...he is THRILLED with it and told me that he had been looking at buying one for himself for quite awhile. He commented on the quality and attractiveness of the display and mentioned how cool it is that he can actually touch his piece of stage. He also said, \"I wonder whose sweat is on that piece of wood?\". So glad I was able to procure a piece before they're all gone. Thank you, it was a great gift! Woodstock Stage Artist Acrylic Frame Customer I was 15 at Woodstock. We actually thought we could change the world… Going to Woodstock was a milestone in my life. This is such a GREAT idea!!! Call me and be a guest on my Florida radio show in its 29th year. Rhett Palmer / Ron McClendon from Poughkeepsie 1969 [****] Please come on my show. Peace Pendant Justin Thomas Perfect Bday gift for a Original Attendee I got this for my mom’s birthday present. She was at the original Woodstock and this was a personalized gift for her. She absolutely loved it. She changed up the bead on the leather string but I think it looks even better. Thanks for the item and making her so happy. Just wish the leather string was a bit heftier. Peace Pendant Brandon Harrop A historical moment frozen in time Couldn’t be happier with this. A very affordable price to own my own little piece of history. I come from a family of musicians and it’s the one event all of us know about. It’s a central moment in time for it, and tho I wasn’t born this is as close as being there myself as I can get. Thank you for sharing this relic of time with all of us! Woodstock Stage Artist Acrylic Frame"

I work at Grateful Days in Dahlonega and I met some of you in the store that day! I went to the show at the Holly Theater and I just wanted to say that I loved your performance! It was absolutely wonderful! I brought my roommate and another friend and we were all vibing. I adored the outfits on stage and the music was just astonishing. You all did a great job and we had such a fun time! Thank you so much for inviting me! Peace Gracie Ray “Peace of Woodstock gave our audience a night of awesome music that brought back so many memories for those in the crowd. Many came in their favorite 1960’s fashions. With the first song, the crowd was on their feet singing and dancing.” Tami Mayhugh – General Manager – Ritz Theatre – Toccoa, GA – Author: Robert Ziarko Comment: Band did two shows in one night to raise money for a children’s charity at the Savannah Center in the Villages Fl. They ROCKED !!  Yes it’s a 55+ community, you would not have known it that night. Absolutely FANTASTIC. Thank you! One of the BEST bands to play the Village’s. Each member is so talented and kind. Loved having them! You’ll be back! rom Mary Goulston from Military Museum in Punta Gorda You were fabulous tonight. We so enjoyed your performance. Thank you for a great night! From: Sharon Skeele-Hogan Sent: Wednesday, May 06 Subject: RE: PEACE OF WOODSTOCKThey were FANTASTIC! High Quality Musicianship I felt this was far more than a tribute … it was performed as an homage to the music of Woodstock, crafted and performed with the love and joy of that era. On a side note: The lead singer completely channeled Janis Joplin. guys ROCK!!!!!  Thank you so much. Douglas W. Anderson, CCM/CAM   General Manager/Chief Operating Officer Turtle Creek Club You guys were outstanding! Thank you for a great show! Carrollwood Cultural Center Oh..god…it was so cool..Yes it was extremely special. Because I was there in 1969…… Kerry Mitchell From Mitzi kann on good night This band recently played at wellington Ampitheater and they were one of the best concerts we saw there!!! Love them… Dear Brad and Band, Thank you so much for giving us a wonderful evening to remember last night! It brought back a lot of memories for most of us in the crowd (there were a few young’uns). I loved watching you all play your instruments so professionally (I used to play acoustic guitar and piano) and the vocals were great. The slides and background info added to the fun, as well as your outfits and ours. We tried to be 1969 stylish! It was a pleasure working with you. Keep on rockin’! Musically yours, Joyce Kantrowitz Villaggio NCJW George Watt says: May 28, 2021 at 12:00 am Best Woodstock tribute band I’ve ever seen and heard.Class act. Jen also does Gracie Slick impressions that will raise goosebumps!! Brad, thanks so much for the shout out to my wife for our 34th anniversary last night.  It made a fun night even better! A post from the Tybee Post Theater on Tybee Island:  Last Friday the talented tribute band Peace of Woodstock grace the Tybee post to a sold out  performance of there 1969 show: music of Woodstock! Yet the real story unfolds 3 years back with one of our volunteers of the year, Donna Collet. When the band first visited 3 years ago bought a band shirt and wore it while she danced and sang the night away! Post show the band expressed gratitude and all signed the back of the shirt. This friday Donna wore the signed shirt to their performance, Jen noticed and invited her back stage, revealing the sad news that there long time guitarist Bill had passed away in April. Touched by the loss and seeing the band showing each other that Bill had signed it Donna presented the shirt back to the band turning sorrow into a heartfelt tribute Glad to see an “old rocker” still rocking!  I was especially impressed with your solo rendition of Beginnings (well, Jen sang harmony). And I didn’t think Jen could pull off Janis, but her best song of the night was Piece of my heart – she nailed it! thanks to you and Fred, Jen, Alvaro (the silent partner) and Brent! Joe Thomas – Some comments from Athens Theater in Delano Fl 9 A very fun time. Band was great and the theater is very comfortable. It was a 10. we Loved it 10 Great fun and memories Excellent show!  Amazing musicians too.  Definitely a 10!! Amazing show 10! Loved it! My party of 4 had a blast! Definitely a 10   It was fantastic It was a 10+.  Loved it! We Loved it !! 10 out of 10 on Santana and Janis Joplin. Thanks for the memories! Definitely 10 Woodstock gets a 10! Loved the entire show, especially Grace Slick, Janis Joplin, and Santana. I’d see it again! 10 I really liked it. The woman who sang Janis Joplin was fantastic 10 They put on a great show. Their dress coordinating with the pictures was Awesome. Lots of energy and pulling the crowd into participate. The BAND.. all of you Bill, Brent, Alvaro, Jen, and You.. Superstars in my view. Bill- MR. Guitar all the way and excellent vocals Jen- Beautiful, Flowing, Peaceful, Calm, multi-talented musician: good to have on Center Stage.. Alvaro- rockin with the BASS sounds Brent— keep the BAND on track  and with the beat..great drumming skills YOU- Positive influence, multi talented, fun loving, gentle…. pulls it all together Nice touch with a CHICAGO Classic with only acoustic guitars and fine voices Rollin STones— strutt like a Roster…. well done Your SHOWs are outstanding with the Musical Talent, Song Selections, and the Outfits… and fun attitudes.. Phil Just wanted to thank the band for a great show despite the inclement weather…as you are well aware, even the original event had to deal with some weather issues.  I enjoyed seeing Peace of Woodstock at Skippers Smokehouse a few years back and was delighted to see a concert scheduled practically in my own backyard.  I was only 8 years old in 1969 but I did get to chat up a few concertgoers on Friday who were there in 69—not surprisingly, the music still resonates so much with us all these years later. Thanks for a great show and hope to see you all again sometime soon. Jeff Had a blast at your Rhythm on the River Show. Unlike many tribute bands that present a mediocre performance with the knowledge that people who loved a particular band will be content just to hear some facsimile of their old favorites, Peace of Woodstock does a multitude of artists VERY WELL! Mike Veeman saw these guys in Port Charlotte last night….Was a great show they all perform well…..Brought back some cool memories I went to your concert. I was also at the original Woodstock. Your performance brought it all back. Your efforts, commitment and your talent is so appreciated.  If you weren’t there, you are there…. every time you perform. It was what you would of imagined. 2 sisters who were at Woodstock with original tickets Woodstock was so amazing all consuming and could never be duplicated.  It was such a special time in my life. I couldn’t make it backup to Bethel New York for this weekend, I’m glad and grateful that I spent a small part of it with you. When I heard you perform., you gave me so much joy and I thank you for it. Kerry Mitchell What a success it was. The membership had a ball, thanks to the energy of your band. Saw them last night at Pinellas Park, Florida Performing Arts Center, great show, full house!! Jen Torres does the best Janis Joplin cover I’ve ever seen, bar none, AMAZING! Janis would love her impression!! Would have been worth twice the price just to see that!! From Jane Morse Hey Peace of Woodstock, We love you guys! I will see you in Jacksonville! We heard such wonderful feedback. We love you guys and hope to have you here again next year!!! Kings Gate Port Charlotte Saw the tribute show last night and it was great! The band works so hard to re-create the crazy days and music of Woodstock. Thanks for your hard work and effort. WOW!!! Tom Marengo We saw your show at Carrollwood Cultural Center Thursday. This was our second year in a row attending the CCC show and I think this year was even better than last year, and you blew out socks off last year, so that’s saying something! You are fantastic! God bless! A Peace of Woodstock comes to the Athens Aug. 21 Saw you guys in Seminole City Park, you were awesome…the guitarist incredible…memories of Hendrix…such great music…keep on rockin” Leslie A Scott I had the opportunity to enjoy them in early 2019 in Sebring. This is a show not to miss. The consumate professionals. Brad, Bill . Jen Alvaro and my drummer pal Brent. Rock on gang All the best in Canada Bob Nothing Short of Fantastic I was fortunate to have gone to the original Woodstock concert while in my 2nd year of college. I was 1 of 2 people in the audience tonight that had gone. I started crying when I heard the songs being sung. I could close my eyes and imagine I was there again; after all these years! The original Woodstock changed my life! Listening tonight was a special time. I definitely recommend this very talented band as they bring to life the historical one- of-a- kind event. My wife and I saw your show at Reunion Resort, Kissimee,Fl. Great show. We were Not at the original Woodstock as we had a baby one month prior which made 2 kids. This show was as we had been told and what we read. Loved it. Thank You to all the band and their support members. This band of professionals were spot on in both music and performance. True pros and it showed. From the first song set, to the final encore, it was true pleasure, awesome may be a better adjective. Every member not only made crucial plusses to the overall performance, but individually were top of the line musicians. Can’t wait to see them again. You can’t help but get taken in to the performance and back 50 years ago! Bob Chapman We were at  your concert on Saturday at Citrus Springs.  My wife and I want you all to know how much we enjoyed it.     Bob Gonciarz I almost don’t like to post anything because my cell phone doesn’t begin to show the talent in this band. To call them a cover band doesn’t begin to do them justice. I kept thinking, “Who are these people and how is it that I am able to go to their concert?!” Each and every member of the group is a major talent. Thank you Brad Trumbull for letting me know about this. You are the real deal. — Blew us away at Wynmoor ! Guitarist shredded Carlos Santana !!! Eyes closed could not tell the difference. Awesome tributes and especially love my girl Janice Joplin. GREAT Band !!! from Kathy http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/pasco-county-group-recreates-woodstock-experience-50-years-later Hey, 70s songwriter here.  I went to ACP (Atlantic City Pop) just before Woodstock.  to summarize my cousin & I got tickets to Woodstock there.  We told the parents (since we were vacationing in OC New Jersey ) that we were going fishing but we’re gonna go to Woodstock. Well, my cousin left his ticket on a night able by his bed where my uncle found it and promptly concluded our ‘fishing trip’ was a hoax and got us both grounded  and tore his ticket up. Well, we never got to Woodstock but did see all the bands at ACP even more. So I felt like I saw Woodstock in a different place. The nice thing about the whole chain of events was that I never use my Woodstock ticket and I hung on to it with all my other ticket stubs from concerts back in the day. So I’ve still got my unused Woodstock ticket which I had professionally preserved and a few other tickets from great concerts back then. I like the 60s so much I started writing music in 1970 and actually finished the song in 71 called , “Stuck in the ’60s”. The song was so well liked I decided to start writing some more songs during my high school years. I ended up writing four albums of music that never got released. If you play my link above you’ll get an idea of what it sounds like. You’ll immediately hear the influences and the music To this day I still play and right and I’ve got material enough to release albums for quite some time. The only problem is recruiting new musicians to play the music since my bandmates have all passed on. Anyway, looking forward to seeing your show if I can make it in my 72 beetle! I hope you enjoyed my little trip here of a story and will love to meet you guys! Righteous righteous fight the good fight! Your fellow hippie, Ray Ray B — GREAT SHOW! This is Gary with Hidden Treasure.  I wanted to thank you guys for such a great show at our flagler beach location during bike week.  I heard nothing but great things.  I was wondering if you had April 27th, 2019 available for 6-10 show.  We would love to  book a few shows with you guys. From: Scott < scottn@webs410.com > Love the band Peace of Woodstock. Seen you play at Skipper’s, etc. Appreciate the time you’ve put into putting on a show. Peace of Woodstock – 2 Thumbs Up! Talk about a time trip! Excellent show! Richard Dabinett The Woodstock buzz is amazing and I’m pretty sure it will be for a time to come. On behalf of Lamplighter Village, thank you for making our event a huge success! Sue, Great show at the Cascades in Estero, Fl! My kind of music!!!!!!! This band is incredible! So much talent. Every member is fantastic. Thanks Brad Trumbull . I’m so glad we were able to see the show! – Peace Of Woodstock, even better than I expected and I expected greatness. — Horst Geyer — THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER DON’T THEY — Wow!

Regards. John Chianis I was at the Peace of Woodstock Show at Trilogy Orlando on March 24th, the band was unbelievable. I especially liked the acoustic portion where you sang Darling Be Home Soon by John Sebastian. Also like the Big Brother and Holding Company (with Janis Joplin) tribute. Do not see Piece of My Heart played that much but your lead singer was unbelievable. Thanks for a great show. David Shumway Recent Posts 50th Anniversary 2018 contacts Hello world!

Published Aug 08, 2022 at 06:22 AM EDT By Molli Mitchell Senior TV & Film Reporter (SEO) Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member If you thought Billy McFarland's Fyre Festival was bad, just wait until you hear what happened at Woodstock 1999. Across three episodes the Netflix documentary series Trainwreck: Woodstock '99 explores the chaos that ensued at Woodstock '99 over the weekend of July 23 to July 25. Held at the former Griffiss Air Base in Rome, New York, the three-day festival saw bands such as Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine grace the main stage while amid the crowd, things were getting seriously out of hand over a whole host of problems. The festival was plagued by poor organization, high prices, no easy access to water, a heat wave, poor sanitation, trench mouth, violence, sexual assault, and an increasingly angry crowd that spilled over into a literal fiery riot on the final day of the festival. Woodstock '99 was a far cry from the history-making 1969 festival, organized by a then 24-year-old Michael Lang who was also involved in Woodstock '94 and Woodstock '99. Newsweek has everything you need to know about Michael Lang and what happened to him. Who is Michael Lang? Music concert promoter, producer and artistic manager Michael Lang in 1969 in Woodstock, New York. | Ginny Winn/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Michael Scott Lang was an American concert promoter, producer, and manager who co-created and organized the first Woodstock Music & Art Fair in 1969.

There, he got involved in promoting concerts and in 1968, alongside Marshall Brevetz, organized the 1968 Pop & Underground Festival which featured acts such as Jimi Hendrix, Arthur Brown and Frank Zappa. Lang returned to New York where he met musician, record producer, and music executive, Arthur Kornfeld. Together, they came up with the idea to celebrate the social movement and countercultures of the 1960s in a festival setting. Together, with partners John P. Roberts and Joel Rosenman, Lang created Woodstock in 1969, which was held on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, New York, from August 15 to August 18, 1969. Michael Lang and Woodstock '99 staff. | Netflix Organized during the height of the Vietnam War, Woodstock was billed as three days of peace, love, and music. Over 400,000 descended on Bethel, New York, to see the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Joan Baez and more. Lang would go on to revive the iconic festival in 1994 and 1999, but both events did not arguably live up to 69's legacy. He also announced the official Woodstock 50 festival, which was planned to take place in August 2019 with acts such as Jay Z, Miley Cyrus, the Killers and Chance the Rapper on the bill. However, the event was ultimately canceled. Away from Woodstock, in the early 1970s, Lang owned Just Sunshine Records which produced and released albums belonging to Karen Dalton, Betty Davis, and Mississippi Fred McDowell. He also managed huge international artists such as Joe Cocker, Tarkan, and Rickie Lee Jones. What Happened to Michael Lang? Lang died on January 8, 2022, from Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He was 77 years old. Lang does feature in Netflix's Trainwreck: Woodstock '99, where he reflects on Woodstock as a whole and the build-up to the 1999 festival. The interview took place three months before he died. His death was announced by his close family friend and representative, Michael Pagnotta. Writing on Twitter , Pagnotta said: \"We are very sad to hear that legendary Woodstock icon and long-time family friend Michael Lang has passed at 77 after a brief illness. Rest In Peace.\" Loading twitter content... Lang is survived by his wife, Tamara Pajic, and his two sons, three daughters, a grandson, and his sister. In his late life, Lang went on to become a music and film producer as well as a music manager, sculptor, and a critically acclaimed author with his book, The Road to Woodstock. He set up the Michael Lang organization covering live events, film production, and artist management. The organization has worked with artists such as Outkast, Prince, Missy Elliot, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Shakira, Bruce Springsteen, Alicia Keys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Avril Lavigne. Reflecting on founding Woodstock, Lang wrote in his best-selling memoir, The Road to Woodstock , written with the music journalist Holly George-Warren: \"From the beginning, I believed that if we did our job right and from the heart, prepared the ground and set the right tone, people would reveal their higher selves and create something amazing.\" Trainwreck: Woodstock '99 is streaming on Netflix now.
