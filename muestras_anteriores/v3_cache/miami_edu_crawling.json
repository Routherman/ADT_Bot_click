SEND US A NEWS TIP The Dakota Inn Rathskeller. Credit: Courtesy photo The Dakota Inn Rathskeller, a nearly century-old German style restaurant and beer hall in Detroit that has been owned by the Kurz family since 1933, has a new owner. The restaurant is now owned by Paddy Lynch, a funeral director-turned-developer who has also acquired The Schvitz, Convent Detroit, and Dutch Girl Donuts in recent years. According to a press release, Lynch has tapped Les Molnar of popular restaurants Johnny Noodle King and Green Dot Stables to serve as culinary director, and Jarred Gild of The Schvitz and the Pash & Glou wine store in Rochesterwine store as beverage director and special programs manager. In the release, Lynch said that “little to nothing will change in the Dakota Inn’s main dining room,” but plans to breath life into the underutilized downstairs Rathskeller bar room with private parties, wine tastings, and other events. [content-1] “I’ve loved the wines of Germany and Central Europe for years and local wine drinkers have shown they do too,” Gild said in a statement. “This will be the best place to explore the diverse styles of the region, from centuries old traditional estates all the way to the hippest natural wine upstarts. There is going to be something for everyone here, and so many cool wines that you can hang out with us every week. Being a regular here is going to be really rewarding.” The new owners say they also want to better utilize the Dakota Inn’s backyard for a year-round biergarten. Other plans include a gift shop, a specialty market, and “even overnight accommodations in the vintage apartments upstairs.” [content-2] While the Dakota Inn typically closed in July, the new owners say they want to keep the backyard biergarten open all summer and reopen the dining room for an anniversary party in the first week of August. The Dakota Inn is located at 17324 John R St, Detroit. Operating hours are 4-11 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, with plans to expand hours in the fall.

We are a small and dedicated shop of twenty seven people: brothers, designers, woodworkers, engineers…gamers. We have been manufacturing furniture for more than 50 years, and we pour that accumulated talent, expertise, and excellence into all our products. You can trust us – we’re family.

With a Rathskellers table you will still be able to play your favorite board games 30 to 40 years from now.

Our innovative aluminum rail system is guaranteed to withstand even the most frustrated dice rolls. If you never have enough wheat, don’t worry! Your table can take the hit. OUR VALUES Creating the ultimate gaming table We started manufacturing tailor-made tables for board gamers in 2013 after spending 18 months prototyping each and every bit of our tables. We combined our love for board games and our experience manufacturing quality furniture to create the Ultimate Board Game Table. Like you, we are passionate about our gaming experiences. We own more than 500 board games and have a dedicated playroom for our board game nights. THE MAKERS Rathskellers was founded in 2013 by the two Milios brothers, Thanos and Paschalis, as an extension of a family-owned furniture business that is now in its third generation. Spending our summer vacations playing Space Crusade & Heroquest while still aiming for that boom shakalaka in our dusty NBA JAM SNES cartridge. Milios Thanos Branding and Marketing Co-Founder Coordinates the many business details of running Rathskellers. He loves design and marketing, but has also used his programming knowledge to publish a variety of apps and games. A lover of Euro games and RPG. His favorite game is Castles of Burgundy. (Although his name is Thanos, he is not the Marvel Super Villain). Milios Paschalis Furniture Design Co-Founder He is the master craftsman of Rathskellers. A wizard with his hands who takes the time to build every detail to perfection. As a fan of abstract and war games, he would suggest a deeper Cellar and Simonis speed cloth – just the right combination for laying down Hanabi cards or pushing around trays of orcs. Milios Stergios Furniture Design Advisor A second-generation expert infurniture manufacturing. As the father of Thanos and Paschalis, and also the owner of Emil, the family’s luxury kitchen and furniture design company, he guides the younger generation through the process offering improvements, and solutions to the many unique challenges of designing specialized gaming furniture. Manufacturing furniture for over 50 years, his expertise is unparalleled. ONE TREE PLANTED Starting from 2022, we plan on planting one olive tree  in Kalamata (Greece) with each order on behalf of our customers. Each tree will be named by their family name with a date of birth (order date). Maybe one day you will be able and visit our olive harvest and enjoy that pure & extra Greek virgin olive oil from your tree...

News Sports High Schools Life Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals JUDY PUTNAM Putnam: Can you identify these folks who were captured on a 1960s Coral Gables mural? Judy Putnam Lansing State Journal EAST LANSING – The longtime owners of a family-run restaurant unearthed a time capsule of sorts this summer. It’s a mural painted more than a half-century ago that for years was hidden behind a wall. A recent renovation uncovered the 33-foot painting at Coral Gables. The collage, which is in good shape, holds nearly 100 images, both portraits and caricatures. It appears to be a who’s-who of people who circulated in East Lansing and customers of Coral Gables, a former roadhouse and dance hall on Grand River Avenue that’s now a restaurant and banquet facility. The owners want help identifying the faces they believe were painted in the early 1960s. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. They’re hoping longtime Spartans in town for home football games this fall will stop in and give them a hand identifying people depicted. The mural, in the back of the building in a hall behind a meeting room, will stay put as the restaurant, which dates back to 1929, works to connect customers to the area’s past. “We are living history,” said Stuart Vanis, general manager of the restaurant. His dad and uncle bought the place in 1968. Coral Gables was strategically located just outside East Lansing city limits, in Meridian Twp., to serve students alcohol as the city was dry until 1968. Among the famous musicians playing there was Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, Duke Ellington and Woody Herman. Chubby Checker played there in 1970. More: From the Archives: Restaurants that have survived and thrived The faces on the mural are not the type of folks who would have populated the “Animal House” style fraternity in the early 1960s. They’re more the clean-cut, shirt-and-tie guys, plus a few women in ‘60s bouffant hairdos and a few athletes in uniform. There’s legendary Spartan football Coach Clarence “Biggie” Munn, who was MSU's athletic director from 1953 to 1971, and a caricature of John Hannah, president of Michigan State University from 1941 to 1969, looking like a mob boss. And then there’s Gruff Sparty, an early version of the MSU's mascot. Today’s Sparty looks a lot more friendly. Former Gov. Jim Blanchard is thought to be among the crowd in the mural. Vanis, who runs the restaurant with his cousin, Anastasia Kimbouris, said customers have already started to identify the people. They said they plan to start capturing the names. Related: Michigan State students are drinking less. No really. Their fathers, Alex Vanis, 85, and George Tesseris, 86, bought the business in 1968. The pair are brothers-in-law. The mural was visible when they bought it, located on the path to the bathrooms from the “show bar.” It was thought to be dated and was covered up during a long-ago renovation in the late ‘70s. No one quite remembers when. Stuart Vanis, born in 1977, said he doesn’t recall it as a kid at all. As the years passed, the mural wasn’t completely forgotten but “we didn’t know the condition of it,” Kimbouris, 44, said. As workmen pulled away drywall and brick covering to widen the hallway, it revealed the mural in still vibrant colors. It's unsigned but two other murals were located in the former basement-level Rathskeller were signed by John Lundstrum, an art student at MSU. It could be the same handiwork. The painting will stay. Lots of Spartans and area residents worked at Coral Gables or met their spouses at the bar. The family wants to remind customers of its long ties to the area. “One of our goals is to let people know we are a place that’s been here forever,” Kimbouris said. The restaurant is located at  2838 E Grand River Ave, East Lansing. If you can identify a face, stop by or call (517) 337-1311. Judy Putnam is a columnist with the Lansing State Journal.
