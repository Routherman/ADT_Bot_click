Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Rachel Ingram is a reporter who covers superyachts and private jets Follow Author Jul 04, 2024, 05:35am EDT Jul 05, 2024, 04:39am EDT Share Save Comment Aqua Blu is transforming luxury expedition yachting in Indonesia Aqua Expeditions If you want to inspire Aqua Expeditions CEO and Founder Francesco Galli Zugaro, don’t tell him he’s brilliant, even though he is. Tell him he’s crazy. Tell him his ambitions are impossible. And then sit back and watch the magic happen. Galli Zugaro is a man who thrives on turning challenge into opportunity. The Italian-American has built a business operating luxury river cruises and yacht charters in some of the most complex destinations in the world – the Peruvian Amazon, the Vietnamese Mekong, the remotest Indonesian islands – onboard yachts he has had specially built. Since founding Aqua Expeditions in 2007, Galli Zugaro has created several game-changing travel propositions for “affluent explorers” and been commended for feats including launching Peru's first luxury river cruise on the Amazon River, transforming luxury expedition yachting in Indonesia with Aqua Blu , and taking the first commercial superyacht ( Aqua Mare ) to the Galapagos. And with a fleet of six boats and counting, he’s not done yet. As Aqua Expeditions prepares to announce its next project, we take a deep dive into Galli Zugaro’s greatest passions, chart his journey to success, and unveil the next steps of his master plan – which may soon be open to strategic investment. Francesco Galli Zugaro, CEO of Aqua Expeditions Aqua Expeditions Where did your passion for travel stem from? Francesco Galli Zugaro: Growing up in 16 countries put the travel bug in me. My dad was Managing Director for Latin America for Alitalia – it was in his blood to travel and this passed down to me. When my parents divorced, I started living with my mom and my stepdad; he was Bureau Chief for TIME magazine in many countries so we moved around from Germany to Lebanon to Israel to Cyprus to Italy, and so forth. After later graduating from Boston, I started working with a private equity group in South America that was investing in telecom and tourism. I ran the telecom startup for five years and then moved over to a small ship expedition investment that we made in the Galapagos. That was how I cut my teeth in travel. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor What lead you to leave the private equity group and set up Aqua Expeditions ? Having left Ecuador and the investment there that we exited, I started looking around South America. Originally, I wanted to go to Argentina. There was an American gentleman called Douglas Tompkins who owned North Face and invested in buying up cattle ranches so I thought, ‘let's head out there’. On the way, I stopped at Iquitos and the Peruvian Amazon and I realise no one was doing the Amazon at a really high-end level’. I went around Iquitos with a Peruvian Navy Admiral who told me there was a 50-metre steel hull for sale around one of the tributaries. So, we took one of the Navy’s little tugboats and knocked on the shed and this guy sold it to me – I towed it away that day. I then commissioned a shipyard to obviously build it for me and brought in Jordi Puig, a very well-known Peruvian architect at the time. From buying it to launching it with heads and beds took us eight months. I don't claim to be the first, but I was the first at the top-end level catering to what I call today ‘affluent explorers’. Onboard Aqua Blu in Indonesia Aqua Expeditions Why did you pick South America to launch the business? I picked South America because I knew it. At the time, the hottest package in South America was Machu Picchu and Galapagos. Compared to Ecuador at the time, the potential growth in Peru was amazing. Orient Express had come in and has five properties and three trains so they were pumping money into promoting the destination. So, I thought, all I have to do is plug a great product in the Peruvian Amazon and it's automatically going to be packaged up into the circuit of Peru at the time. It was very easy to quickly position a top end premium product. So I sold my house in Ecuador, moved my whole family to Peru and put everything into it. It was a risk, but I have a healthy measured appetite for risk. Why did you decide to build a boat-focused business rather than enter the hotel market? Having operated in the Galapagos, I thought how cool is it that you can control the guest experience? To really curate a guest experience in a one-night stay in a hotel is very difficult – you can't really make an impact. With the whole yachting experience cruising experience, you can curate something and create really cool environment for guests. From a business perspective, these businesses are very cash rich because you can have high cash flow because people are booking ahead of time, with very few cancellations because these are long-haul aspirational trips. So, this has always been an appealing a both experiential and business opportunity. Service and hospitality is key onboard all of Aqua Expeditions' boats Aqua Expeditions Why did you decide to build 12-cabin boats, and do you have plans to create larger ships? I wanted something small. Originally the concept was to copy the idea of houseboats from Kerala put them on Amazon. I said ‘let's do four ships with two smaller cabins’, but when I ran the numbers, it wasn't scalable – the more you grow, the more fixed costs you have. Whereas on a 12-cabin ship, you can have 24 guests, but the economies of scale, as soon as you break even, become super attractive because our variable costs are very low. The only variable costs are the additional food and additional guides; the fuel and the operation are still fixed. Secondly, the guest experience has to be dictated by small groups. These are trips with a high level of engagement to the the connection with the guides is key. We will never do anything that's above four couples to a guide – that allows you really to have an opportunity to engage, and the guide can tailor the excursions to that group. You can’t accomplish something so unique with a 100-guest ship. Francesco Galli Zugaro in front of luxury river boat Aqua Mekong Quan light-writer Photography How many of your ships are private charters versus tour operator bookings? About a quarter of our business is private charter. Today, all of our ships operate 48 weeks. We have 30% charters, so about 15 charters a year, and most of them are private, but a lot of them are tour operator buyouts. So, in other words, a client comes in, buys out the ship for the week, and then resells it under their brand, because they package that up with a week in Siem Reap or Ho Chi Minh. On private charters, what happens a lot is that we have two principal clients paying and it was hard for them to figure out who gets that top owner suite. So, in our river ships we have three suites which are very similar and very large. We've done that on all the ships, and that's allowed us to appeal very well to a private charter client. Why did you choose to focus your business on areas that are more complex than others? I just like the challenge. I like the feeling of accomplishment when I’ve been told many times ‘no it’s impossible, or no, you’re crazy,’ and then I showcase that it can be done. It just requires a vision and the capacity to execute. What initially started off as a vision is today a realization of 300 talented individuals that are working with me, from crew to management. I like a challenge; I don't like to take the easy way out. My biggest enjoyment comes from seeing guests appreciate what we've done. Raja Ampat Aqua Expeditions Aqua Blu is redefining luxury expedition cruising in Indonesia . What lead you to operate in this destination? I liked Indonesia you still feel like you're exploring. Galapagos in comparison is very structured. It's an amazing guest experience, but it's very regimented. In Indonesia, you can go exploring to see volcanoes, find dragons and birds-of-paradise, sail around Raja Ampat and the Spice Islands, and see what nature throws at you. That excites me, even though it's very difficult to get the permits. It look me two years to get the permits to flag in Indonesia, but I want to bring guests to see these parts of the world that are logistically complicated, and do it at a very high level. What are your guests looking for, and how do you match destinations to meet their expectations? If you talk to our guests, they've done everything. They're looking for something cool, different and relaxed. They want the world-class service but they're not pretentious so they're willing to walk barefoot and let their hair down. And a destination has to check their boxes in terms of nature and wildlife. I chose the Vietnamese Mekong because it’s an iconic river connected to two iconic World Heritage sights – Siem Reap and Angkor Wat. And then I decided to operate in three marine biosphere reserves – Galapagos, Raja Ampat and Komodo – which are on everybody's bucket list. The next destinations will have a combination of that; they'll have either iconic rivers of the world or iconic coastal cruising that will provide a wildlife and nature component, and sometimes even a cultural component. Private beach sundowners at Komodo National Park Aqua Expeditions What are your long-term plans for the company? I've got a very clear map of exactly where I'm going to put ships. Pretty much true to form, I've delivered one every three years. Next year will be my 18th year and I'll be delivering my sixth ship. The details of where how and where will be revealed later this year. I've scouted the destinations and built itineraries – that's what I do on my off-time; I spend weeks and months scouting different bodies of water all over the world. That's my passion; finding new logistically complex destinations that I think I could venture into; raising the capital to finance the ships, because these are getting more and more expensive; and building unique itineraries. What opportunities are there for interested investors? This is a very profitable business because of our fixed costs. As long as you break even, profit could be in the range of somewhere around 50%. This year we’re going to exceed our forecast and forward bookings for 2025 are very strong already. From an investor point of view, I've obviously retained control of the business and continue to do so. It doesn't mean that that will continue to be the case in the future. I'm open minded to see if I can add value strategically from a strategic partner – I have access to capital, but that strategic capital is something that I'm looking for in the future so that I can strategically roll out my business faster, and maybe have an opportunity to bring passenger flow to us faster, rather than organically growing. There aren’t that many Aquas around. We’re the only business that has this size, this niche, this reach. The day Aqua goes out to market to find that strategic partner, I think it’s going to attract a lot of eyes that want to get into that space.

What about the wildlife at Cosmeston Lakes? A detailed ecological assessment, undertaken by local firm Acer Ecology, has confirmed that the seasonal Aqua Park at Cosmeston Lakes Country Park will have no significant negative impact on local birdlife or water vole populations. The Aqua Park will be situated away from sensitive bird nesting areas, further reducing any potential for disruption. The eastern lake, already supports a range of recreational activities such as paddleboarding, sailing, dog walking and scuba diving. The study shows that bird species in the area are already well adapted to this level of human activity. Many common bird species show high tolerance to disturbance and are unlikely to be affected by the seasonal operation of the inflatable water park, which are temporary structures. Extensive surveys and habitat assessments on water voles where carried out, which found that the area proposed for the Aqua Park has limited suitability for water voles. The park will be located on open shoreline lacking the vegetation that water voles rely on, and no signs of burrows or active vole presence were found in that specific zone. As such, the risk of harming water vole populations is considered negligible. The parks SSSI status is there because of one species of rare underwater plant, starry stonewart, which is only found in the western lake, the eastern lake is formally designated as suitable for recreational activity. The seasonal nature of the attraction, combined with safeguards, that the Aqua Park can operate safely and responsibly whilst maintaining the park’s wildlife conservation goals. What’s the water quality like at Cosmeston Lakes? Your safety is our top priority. The Aqua Park only opens when water quality meets recognised safety standards and conditions are safe for activities to take place. During the spring of 2025, a professional scuba diving team has surveyed the lakebed where the Aqua Park is located, in conjunction with a bathymetric depth survey, to confirm that there are no objects under the surface and that the water depth is suitable (3m – 12m). Our water samples are tested and analysed by Public Heath Wales at their UKAS-accredited laboratory. We take two samples at the same time and from the same location on the Aqua Park, which are tested side by side. This helps us identify any potential sampling or laboratory errors, as the two results should be very close to each other. For transparency, the graphs shown on our website display the average of the two results. Our closure policy is precautionary and always based on the worst result . We have been taking samples twice a week during the 2025 bathing season to ensure water quality remains safe. Two key indicators are tested: E. coli Intestinal Enterococci These bacteria occur naturally in the gut of humans and animals. Most strains are harmless, but high levels can indicate pollution and may pose a risk if swallowed. We follow guidance given directly to us by Swim England , who have stated that there should be no swimming when results are above the levels below. These are the same fail levels as World Aquatics and The Aqua Park Association, following national and international governing bodies 1,000 CFU/100ml for E. coli 400 CFU/100ml for Intestinal Enterococci Aqua Park Sessions may only resume once subsequent testing has shown results are below these thresholds .We also adopt many of the principles of the World Aquatics testing regime , alongside the requirements of our own industry body, the Aqua Park Association , which accredits Aqua Parks across the UK. These same standard levels are applied across the country to a wide range of open water recreational activities, from Aqua Parks to open water swimming and even designated inland bathing waters. The graphs show bacteria levels over time, measured in colony-forming units (CFU) per 100ml . The red line shows the Fail threshold. Beneath the red is considered Good Quality The green line shows the Excellent threshold. All our results from the 2025 bathing season are published here. To date, the water has consistently met the standards required for safe bathing. Where is Cosmeston Lakes Aqua Park?
