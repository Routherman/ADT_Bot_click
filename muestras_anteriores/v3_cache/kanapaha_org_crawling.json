View the Guide What You’ll Want to Know About Kanapaha Botanical Gardens Fun Facts Kanapaha Botanical Gardens is the largest herb garden in the southeast. Who would have thought you’d find an astounding 62-acres of green space just near the bustling city of Gainesville? You can view all of the exhibits as you walk down the large, one-and-a-half-mile paved walkway that weaves throughout thriving greenery. Take a look at the garden map so you can navigate your way! Interestingly, a Native American tribe named the Timucua were the first to use the word Kanapaha , meaning palmetto leaves and home. This fits the botanical gardens perfectly, as it houses so many prosperous plants. Lake Kanapaha got its name first. When the botanical gardens were created, the local attraction adopted the name since it resides right along the peaceful waters. Most Praised Plants & Exhibits When you visit in the warm months of June through September, you’ll see plants offering the most colors. Some of the most popular exhibits include the giant Victoria Water Lillies and Asian Snake Arums. Water Lillies are circular, electric green, and can grow up to ten feet in diameter! View them floating serenely throughout the ponds of the garden. Asian Snake Arums, on the other hand, are planted firmly in the ground and have tall, purple blooms. These botanical gardens are also home to Florida’s largest public display of bamboos. You can view the forest-like bundle of Chinese royal bamboo up close as you follow the pathway throughout the park.

Courtesy of Kanapaha Botanical Gardens If you drive down Archer Road through the busy section between 34 th Street and the exit and entry ramps for Interstate 75, you will be maneuvering down the main drag with one of the largest retail centers in the southeast on one side of it and strip mall heaven on the other. It’s hard to imagine there’s a quiet place to get away from it all just down the road. But about a mile west of Exit 384, take a right at the sign for Kanapaha Botanical Gardens and you will end up somewhere you may never want to leave. It’s a 68-acre natural wonderland that includes Florida’s largest display of bamboos and the largest herb garden in the Southeast. Become A Member Mainstreet does not have a paywall, but pavement-pounding journalism is not free. Join your neighbors who make this vital work possible. See Member Benefits Director Alexis Caffrey loves the gardens, not surprising as she is the daughter of founder Don Goodman. “When I was a child, my dad would pick me up from school and take me to Kanapaha and I would play on the grounds until the end of the workday,” she said. “I have an attachment to this property because of the time I spent here while I grew up. “When I was younger Kanapaha didn’t have as many customers, and it felt as though I had the whole gardens to myself,” she said. “My job is very fulfilling because I love this property and creating beauty. It is a peaceful place to work.” Caffrey said the gardens take their name from a contraction of two Timucua Indian words for “palmetto leaves” and “house” and refer to the “thatched huts utilized by the lake’s earliest human inhabitants. Lake Kanapaha – the feature from which we take our name – means ‘lake of the houses,’ distinguishing it as an inhabited lake,” she said. Work began on the land in 1978, although it wasn’t until 1986 that the gardens opened to the public. The hours spent at Kanapaha Botanical Gardens, whether on foot or in a wheelchair or another mobility device, are a passage through paradise along a 1.5-mile paved path. All of it is viewable from different vantage points. Great care is taken to make everything accessible as the visitor meanders through the mystique of the gardens. Caffrey’s dad designed the main sidewalk trails. “On the eastern loop, he liked the aesthetics of a winding trail that maximized the space by creating a circular trail that encompassed the outskirts of the property. “The western side of the gardens are primarily dominated by the water gardens and as such, the sidewalk follows along the water’s edge, forming a “T” shape,” she said. The gardens have 24 major botanical collections that the visitor can enjoy, including the bamboos and herb garden. Some are organized taxonomically; others demonstrate the principles of ecology or natural selection. Water lilies, especially the Giant Victoria Water Lilies, stand out in the summer months. The gardens have set records for two species, the Longwood Hybrid at 8 feet and for the cultivated (and possibly wild grown) Victoria cruziana in 2019 at 93 inches, according to Caffrey. There are also gazebos galore in the gardens that give visitors some respite from rain or Florida’s often grueling sunshine. “We wanted to provide places for guests to sit in the shade and rest or picnic,” Caffrey said of another one of her dad’s ideas. Goodman is the author of Summer of the Dragon, which recounts his life as a naturalist and how he lost his right arm to an alligator two decades ago, but as he wrote, he still maintains his sense of humor. Of course, keeping up the grounds takes work. This writer has made numerous visits to the gardens and there is always someone at work, perhaps planting or weeding or doing whatever is necessary to keep things looking good. “Given the small staff and large acreage, we are always prioritizing projects to yield the maximum results in making the overall gardens look maintained,” Caffrey said. “Tasks change depending on the season. For example, we mow the facility every week during the summer but less so other times of year. After winter, a large portion of time is spent removing dead plant material killed by the frost,” she added. The gardens have eight staff members, three full-time and five part-time. But much of the work is done by 320 volunteers, who put in about 5,800 hours of service each year, Caffrey said. “Many come to the gardens and fill out a volunteer form to get started. Some reach out to us looking for a place to get some sort of school credit. Other organizations, like the Gainesville Gardening Club and Florida Nurserymen and Growers Association, have long-standing volunteer ties to Kanapaha,” Caffrey said. Not unsurprisingly the gardens offer the most color from June through September. Kanapaha hosts many special events including a Bamboo Sale and the Spring Garden Festival. Dogs are permitted on leashes except during special events, Picnic baskets are welcome and there is a picnic area very close to the entrance building. The gardens are open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Thursdays when the facility is closed. Weekend hours are from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. or dusk, whichever is earlier, Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for children 5 – 13 when accompanied by an adult. Children under 5 enter free. Annual memberships are also available.

Bamboo that dies after February will be replaced the following year since we only dig bamboo during its optimal transplanting time in January and February. However, decisions regarding replacement are made on a case-by-case basis to insure that Kanapaha Botanical Gardens is the party at fault. We are not responsible for the replacement of plants that, for example, are not adequately covered/protected during transport and prior to planting, planted outside of their suitable survival range or that show signs of obvious neglect. Kanapaha's staff is skilled in the selection and excavation of the clumps we sell and survival is nearly 100% if the plants receive proper care. Therefore, we will not assume responsibility in situations where a large proportion of a bamboo order dies, as this suggests they received inadequate care after purchase. We sell bamboos that grow well in north Florida under normal weather conditions and cannot be held responsible for losses caused by extreme and unusual weather events or other natural phenomena beyond our control such as running bamboos dying back after flowering or ornamental varieties of bamboo reverting back to their original form. We do not replace bamboos that we replaced the previous year. Copyright © Kanapaha - All Rights Reserved. Powered by"

The Spring Garden  Festival features 100 booths offering plants, landscape displays,  garden accessories, arts and crafts, educational exhibits and, of  course, foods. Also featured are  live  entertainment on Sunday. PARKING INSTRUCTIONS All parking is on-site during our special events. Parking is free. To help this event run smoothly, we need guests to follow our parkers instructions to guide you to your parking location. The flow of traffic is only one way during the event. Guests who refuse to follow parking instruction (drive the wrong way, speed past our parkers etc) pose a safety hazard to our other guests and will be escorted off the property. Be aware that you may pass open spots/lots while being directed further to park because certain areas have handicap / small vehicle / oversize vehicle etc. designations.  Please \"go with the flow\" and trust that our parkers know what they are doing. When we are parking thousands of cars in a day, our parkers do not have time to stop and explain our parking process and any vehicle stopped asking questions holds up the entire line of traffic behind them.
