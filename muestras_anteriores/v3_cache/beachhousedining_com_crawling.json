JOSEPH RESSLER, HERALD & REVIEW DECATUR — The Beach House promised an experience that “will be bigger and better than ever before” when it announced its temporarily closure at the beginning of the new year for “major renovations.” In addition to its totally reconstructed dining area and a revamped menu, the list of “major” changes also includes new owners. Todd Parker and Craig “Woody” Wilson are now at the helm of this restaurant along Lake Decatur that is expected to open before March 11. They follow longtime owners Todd and Angie Mason. “The Beach House has been a passion project,” Parker said. “I don’t want to own restaurants, but I do want to own the Beach House.” Parker said his first memories of the building go back to his childhood, when he would walk along the lake shore with his mom, feeding the ducks.

That appreciation grew as he got older and began enjoying the magnificent view of the nearby lake while dining with friends on the restaurant’s deck. Parker said he began pondering some 10 years ago things that could be done to enhance the venue and make the experience even better for its customers. Those thoughts gave way to serious discussions with Todd Mason and Wilson some three years ago, which came to a head in the past few months. After efforts to hire the perfect general manager to lead their venture came up short, it was decided that Wilson, who has extensive experience operating local restaurants and bars, would assume that responsibility to get the project moving. Wilson said there was something about this project that drew him in, making him want to be a part of it and see it move beyond the discussion stage. \"When you stand behind that bar and you look out and you see the lake, man, there's just something special about it,\" he said. That decision cleared the way for the ownership change and renovations. “As proud owners of the Beach House, we’ve had the immense pleasure of welcoming so many wonderful guests into our little slice of paradise. Over the years, your laughter, stories, and cherished moments have filled this place with warmth and life,” read a post on the restaurant’s Facebook page from Todd and Angie Mason. Going against the advice of some trusted friends, Todd Mason emerged from the gas station business and purchased Marcia's Waterfront on Aug. 1, 2005. He selected the name Beach House to tap into the building's beginning as the bathhouse for visitors of the Lake Decatur Beach. In this 1957 file photo, swimmers enjoy a break from the heat by taking a swim at the Decatur Municipal Beach. In the background is the bathhouse, which is now home to the Beach House. Scott Perry “Now, as we turn the page to a new chapter, we want to say thank you — to our guests, to our employees, and to everyone who has made this journey so special. The memories we’ve shared will stay with us forever,” the post read. “We are super excited for the new owners. Their vision for the future is absolutely amazing and long overdue for this beautiful historic site. In good hands, the Beach House will remain a place of joy and inspiration for many years to come.” Contacted later, Mason reiterated his confidence in Parker and Wilson. “When I sat down with the new owners in the very beginning, I explained that I wasn’t really an owner. The business and building were bigger and more important than me. I was simply trying to be a good steward for the community. That being said, they both smiled in agreement and I knew that this was going to be a good decision,” Mason said. “I'm looking forward to what they do because, I tell you what, the plans that they have are amazing and I think Decatur is really going to be proud of what they see when they walk into the Beach House the next time. I'm super excited for these guys,” said Mason, who plans to be their biggest cheerleader. Far removed from his poor upbringing, Parker is a certified financial adviser with Northwestern Mutual and co-founder of Parker Mathis Wealth Advisors. Parker said his financial security provides him the opportunity make a significant investment toward the improvements with the goal of just breaking even and the prospect for much, much more. “Where else anywhere within a two-hour radius do you have a more gorgeous place to eat,” he said. Parker hopes to build on the restaurant’s past success by infusing culinary concepts he has encountered while dining out during his extensive travels. “I’m trying to build my favorite place to eat on the planet,” he said. While there will be items that remain on the menu at all times, plans call for quarterly menu changes. “It gives you a reason to go (to the restaurant) quarterly just because you know it’s going to be something different all the time,” Parker said. The bathhouse as it appeared in the 1960. Originally designed as an open-air pavilion on the upper level with a bathhouse below, it was built in the 1920s to serve the Decatur Municipal Beach. In the 1980s, the structure was transformed into a restaurant, with several successful owners taking charge over the years. Scott Perry Wilson said the plan is to create a revolving menu that includes a variety of unique items, especially when it comes to seafood, made from the \"best of the best\" ingredients. The goal of the renovations is to create a vibe that engages the customers, making them want to put down their phones. “When people step into the restaurant we want them to engage each other and the environment,” Parker said. Parker said the dining room renovation is phase one of the improvements. Phase two will bring improvements this summer to the outdoor dining area. As for the existing banquet area, the future of that space is undecided. Parker tossed out the prospect of it becoming a sports bar, but added they will be looking to their customers for more direction. For Wilson, who has been part of many bar/restaurant openings, the same thing that makes it fun also makes it challenging. \"The most fun is just every day, when you come in here and see all the dramatic changes,\" he said. But he said the quick turnaround — construction started Jan. 6 — is also a source of stress. \"We've completely remodeled this whole thing, so it's been pretty intense,\" he said\" Parker praised the relationship they have built with the park district, which owns the historic structure, and the support it has shown as he turns his dream into reality. “The team meets weekly and it’s clear that a lot of thought and care is being put into these changes, and the end result promises to elevate the overall experience for everyone who visits,” said Clay Gerhard, the park district’s executive director. Gerhard also took time to praise the Masons. “Many restaurants don’t survive beyond five or 10 years so for the Masons to have owned and operated the Beach House successfully for over 20 years, I think that is a testament to their work ethic and dedication,” Gerhard said. “It would be interesting to know how many community events, private events, weddings, and other memories have been made in the Beach House over the years and to think of what new memories are going to be created once the new Beach House opens for business.” As it has in the past, Parker and Gerhard are hopeful the Beach House will once again be the catalyst for even more improvements along the lakefront that will appeal to visitors and enhance efforts to recruit workers and businesses to the community. In recent years the area has seen the addition of the amphitheater, Splash Cove waterpark, Overlook Adventure Park and new boat docks. Also included in the park district’s master plan is Chandler Cove, an area proposed for condominium-style residential developments, and the shopping and restaurants in the area around the Beach House. “This revitalization, along with the development that’s taken place in Nelson Park over the past decade, continues to solidify Nelson Park as the premier entertainment district in our community. We’re optimistic that additional restaurants and dining options will be added along the lakefront in the future, as we work to continue enhancements to our overall quality of life here in Decatur,” Gerhard said.
