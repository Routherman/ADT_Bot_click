Skip to content SUPPORT THE VENUE Support the Venue We Welcome Your Donations DONATE SECURELY WITH PAYPAL CHECKOUT Thank you for your generosity in supporting Venue on Lake Lily. To make your donation quickly and securely use one of the options provided on this page. Venue on Lake Lily is possibly the only remaining community center of its kind in the nation. Since 1965, the Maitland Civic Center has been a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a mission to provide a place where our community can gather and enjoy public, private and secular events, conveniently located in the heart of Central Florida. All funds from venue rentals go to administer and maintain this storied place, where memories are made. Leonard “Len” Schmidt It’s with a sorrowful, broken heart that we, the Board of Directors and Staff of the Venue on Lake Lily – The Maitland Civic Center – share that we recently lost an incredible friend, member of our Board of Directors, Vice President, and a fantastic advocate for the community of Maitland. Even before his involvement with the Maitland Civic Center, Len was an advocate for the citizens of Maitland. Through his championing the community with various causes, i.e., negotiations with the initial developers of Maitland Center to protect the community’s interests and holding City Leaders through the years accountable to their commitments to us, the community. In addition, he loved the arts and supported other community non-profits such as Performing Arts Matter, Art and History Museums Maitland, and the Maitland Library. When Len joined the Venue’s Board, he continued to champion our community’s multiple interests and, most importantly, help save the Venue during an unforeseen pandemic through his business acumen. Len was a warrior, and his passing left a great void in many lives. However, he will never be replaced. Instead, Len’s past presence will only inspire new volunteers to our community’s causes. Rest in peace, our dearest friend. You are missed! The Board of Directors, Officers, and Staff, Venue on Lake Lily – The Maitland Civic Center LEONARD SCHMIDT MEMORIAL FUND In lieu of flowers Len’s family has designated his favorite charity, the Maitland Civic Center, for memorial contributions. The Maitland Civic Center is now accepting donations in memory of Len Schmidt. The Venue is a non-government owned, privately run 501c3 non-profit community-serving organization.

He was an amazing talent, an award-winning artist/designer, and a community advocate. He leaves a void in our lives. We will forever miss him.
