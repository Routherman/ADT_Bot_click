Our Patron Cherie Blair CBE, KC Brought up in Sefton, Cherie became our Patron in 2007, donating her time to passionately promoting the importance of charitable giving to support communities and those most in need. Founder of the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, she is a leading international human rights lawyer, a passionate campaigner for women’s equality, and wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Cherie has actively campaigned for human rights and equality for women. She is closely involved with a number of charities around the world with a special emphasis on those working with women, children and the transformative power of education. Our President Amanda Parker Amanda Parker became Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire in August 2023, and in October of that year it was announced that she would follow on from Lord Shuttleworth as President of the Community Foundation for Lancashire. Amanda, a proud Lancastrian, lives at Browsholme Hall, the Parker family’s estate and the oldest historic family home in Lancashire. She has dedicated her life to serving her community, both in her previous role as a magistrate, and supporting young people through sport, especially hockey, as well as in her role as chair of National Crimebeat, a youth crime prevention charity.

I served as managing Partner and subsequently Senior Partner of what grew into a hugely successful commercial law practice with a turnover in excess of £100m, five offices across the UK, together with four overseas locations. In 2012, the Hill Dickinson Foundation was established, with the support of the Community Foundation, providing support to community-based projects within the UK where Hill Dickinson had a presence. \n\nI became a Trustee of the Community Foundation for Merseyside in 2016 and was appointed Chair of the Community Foundations for Lancashire and Merseyside in 2022. I very much enjoy cooking (I recently completed a sourdough bread making course) and wine tasting. To work off the excess of food and drink, I am a keen cyclist and skier, and have also developed a passion for long distance walking. I have completed five UK long distance footpaths in the last 4 years. I am a regular concert goer, particularly at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, but regrettably have no musical talent of my own! I am however an incurable optimist and accordingly have been a season ticket holder at Everton Football Club for over 50 years! Neil Welsh As financial adviser working for PM+M Financial Planning, based in Blackburn, I service and maintain a bank of around fifty clients supporting their financial planning needs. I joined PM+M in 2015, following a couple of years in small IFA businesses and 25 years before that in banking. Alongside this, I also act in an ambassadorial business development role, representing PM+M within the local business community.\n\nMy strong network of connections and experience gained in employed and voluntary roles makes me well-placed to serve the interests of the Community Foundation. A lapsed cyclist I’ve now largely exchanged two wheels for running shoes. Together with partner Helen and daughter Caitlin I represent Ramsbottom Running Club in events up to half marathon, although a full marathon is inevitable. Calories are replaced with nice food, wine and a passion for Belgian beer. Testing my Duolingo progress with French holidays, sunshine and culture helps punctuate the work calendar. I’m a frequent fundraiser for Pendleside Hospice and Burnley FC season ticket-holder alongside son Evan. The sooner the 2023/24 season is over the better! LinkedIn Ruj Dev I joined as Trustee in November 2023, bringing 20 years’ of extensive experience in both the public and private sectors. Having begun my career with Price Waterhouse Coopers, I have since earned recognition as a Fellow Chartered Accountant of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). I have a wealth of experience that includes over eleven years within a number of prominent law firms in the North West. Nature is my sanctuary, whether I’m on a peaceful walk, an adrenaline fuelled challenge, or just relaxing by the shore. My family have always been my rock, grounding me and offering valuable perspective in everything I do. Though I don’t obsess over gym routines, I prioritise staying active for my overall health and well-being. Contributing to causes close to my heart through volunteering or support brings me great joy. I’m always on the lookout for ways to make a positive difference. Travelling fuels my sense of exploration, nourishing both my curiosity and spirit. My actions are always driven by a constant desire to leave a lasting, meaningful impact. LinkedIn Sarah Pickerill I joined the Community Foundation in 2023. I have worked in professional services firms within HR and development departments for over 20 years, including as a HR & Development Director.\n\nI joined Carpenters Group as Head of People in 2020, and am responsible for leading on HR, recruitment, and learning and development, as well as working closely with all teams across the business. My role ensures that Carpenters Group continues to be a fantastic place to work, where people are listened to, innovation is embraced, and people feel valued as they help grow both their own career and the business. Outside my professional work as an HR Director, I am passionate about my family, my caravan in Anglesey and my love of all things running (the order depends on what day it is!). I set up Southport Strollers Running Club in 2018, which is now an all-inclusive England Athletics affiliated club with over 200 members, meeting 3 times a week. I’m proud to have run (mainly slowly) London, Chicago and Berlin marathons, as part of the series of World Major marathon series and excited to take part in the New York marathon in 2024. LinkedIn Naz Zaman I am the current Chief Officer of Lancashire BME Network (LBN), a membership organisation supporting BAME groups and organisations. I have successfully led the organisation through periods of transition and change, most recently around COVID-19 prevention. Prior to my involvement in LBN, I worked across the public and voluntary sectors in a range of roles, including acting as the Equality and Inclusion Lay Member for the East Lancashire Clinical Commissioning Group. \n\nAs well as managing a thriving and continually growing organisation, I sit as a magistrate, and I am also an approved foster carer. Away from work I enjoy spending time with family and friends, going out for food and trying new experiences. I have an interest in crime and psychological thrillers, yes, I know it sounds odd but I have a fascination with human psyche. I also enjoy going away with my husband who loves running marathons abroad, which I’m quite happy to take the credit for. LinkedIn Donna Howitt I joined Liverpool ONE in 2007, a year ahead of opening, in order to establish the Liverpool ONE brand as a household name. I have led on campaigns and initiatives that have breathed excitement and life into a city that is going from strength to strength. Community is at the heart of what Liverpool ONE does and the establishment of the Liverpool ONE Foundation has been fundamental to their care for communities and the people across the city region.  \nI bring strong marketing and PR expertise to the table with a genuine passion for the city and wider city region. A self-proclaimed, unofficial taxi driver to two teenage daughters, means my life outside of work is as busy as it is in the office! After a brief stint at ‘back to Netball’, I instead invested time in my daughters love and talent for the game. With both playing weekly all over the North-west for super-league pathway teams, they play above their years for Scotland Netball in the U17’s and U19’s national squads. As a family it has so far taken us to Tobago for the Commonwealth Youth Games, Belfast, Cardiff and to Gibraltar to complete at Netball Europe. When the time allows, I enjoy Pilates, am at my most competitive playing table tennis and at my happiest outdoors, walking my dog, Bob, the cockerpoo! LinkedIn Ram Gupta I come from a humble background, the youngest of four brothers, my professional journey began with a range of jobs that shaped my strong work ethic, including stacking shelves and door-to-door sales. These experiences instilled in me the value of hard work and striving for excellence. Using these values, I became the owner and managing director of nybble.co.uk Ltd, an award-winning IT company providing services globally. Our ethos, “customer is KING,” drives us to deliver exceptional IT, software, and cybersecurity solutions, while maintaining a people-focused approach.\n\nBecoming a Trustee for the Community Foundation for Lancashire and Merseyside (CFLM) was a natural step in my commitment to giving back.

Outside work, I am involved in various philanthropic and community-driven roles, including serving as a Governor at Blackburn College and supporting causes like Nightsafe and Lancashire Mind.

It is an honour to contribute to CFLM’s mission and work alongside others who share a passion for creating positive change. LinkedIn Andy Myers I retired in 2013 after a varied career, my role prior to retirement was with the Big Lottery Fund, one of the distributors of National Lottery money. The Foundations vision, of enriching the lives of people through strategic grant making, matches my passion in respect of the not-for-profit sector. I have seen first-hand, on numerous occasions, how targeted grants to well run and strategically placed organisations can hugely benefit communities, and I wanted to be part of that process going forward. Most people who know me will probably agree that travel is a huge factor in my life. Even before retirement my wife and I fitted in as many holidays as possible. I have been fortunate to travel far and wide and experience the beauty of many different cultures and environments. I am blessed to have a family that makes me smile every day, whether it is the grandsons who keep me feeling young and old at the same time, or my son who still makes me proud when he achieves a PB in his latest running event. My other passions are motorcycle tours around Europe with friends, and supporting Everton FC which is certainly character building.
