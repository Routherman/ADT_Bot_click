We have four we own and two are run by another company,“ said Chapman, who also added the June 14 Sunday Funday included kayak and paddle board rentals. Pontoon rentals just down the new 500-foot dock run half days, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and full days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for visiting Shell Island, fishing in St. Andrew Bay or seeing dolphins.

Food trucks, live music from the pavilion and other family activities are scheduled 6-10 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays and 1 p.m. to sunset Sundays. “The Will Thompson Band is playing every Thursday,” Chapman said. Outside lawn chairs are welcome, although there’s plenty of seating and shade with blue umbrella topped picnic tables in hues of pink, green and blues, an eclectic mix of chairs and benches under a covered pergola — or sink your toes in the sand from a chair near the water. “Everyone seems to love it’s on this side of the bridge without the beach traffic,” Chapman said. “It’s hard to see from the road, but you turn in and there’s a white, sandy beach right on the bay with a beautiful view.” The Panama City property at 4601 U.S. 98 just before the Hathaway Bridge had sat vacant since the 2008 Recession — two years before Chapman graduated from Mosley High School. “The last two years or so, I thought maybe we should do something with the property,” said Chapman, who went to grad school for business at Rollins College after graduating from Florida State University. “I wrote my thesis on the property and read it to my uncle (David Chapman) over Easter.” The family has been able to put the business plan into action. “It was named after my grandfather who was a businessman for Panama City over 40 years,” Chapman said. “He always loved to have a good time and be around family and friends, and we thought what better way to honor him than have a fun community spot named after him.” Local businessman and philanthropist Joe Chapman died in 2016. “I had a dream I’d always come back and start something here,” Chapman said. “I think people are just excited to go somewhere COVID-friendly. It’s outside; you don’t have to be cooped up. We definitely take the threat seriously. It’s all outdoors and tables are spread well over six feet.” Fireworks were part of the grand opening celebration June 11, but Chapman said they are considering additional fireworks July 2 and a component with special events. “Lawn games include cornhole on the sand, life-size Connect 4, and Spikeball. Hopefully, we’ll be operational six days a week and start a volleyball league,” Chapman said. Tequila Joe’s, a bright blue permanent building on the property, is set to come into fruition this month with specialty tequilas, different margaritas, daquiris and other frozen drinks. No coolers or outside drinks are allowed on the property. Portable restrooms are located on site. Brews & Views Father’s Day Weekend at Papa Joe’s Bayside is being touted “Brews & Views.” Papa Joe’s food truck serves beginning at 6 p.m. every Thursday through Saturday and is working on expanding their menu. “We serve tacos in bowls out of our food truck, and on the weekends, guest food trucks come in for a night,” Chapman said. “Right now, we’re set up for us plus three food trucks.” Guest trucks set to appear Thursday, June 18, included Temperley’s British Eatery, Crepe and Creme, and Parlor Doughnuts with live entertainment by the Will Thompson Band from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Friday, June 19, features Liza's Munchies Machine, All Wrapped Up, and Parlor Doughnuts with live entertainment from the Shawn and Scott Duo on Saturday, June 20, will feature The Nomad, I Roll Lumpia and Parlor Doughnuts with live music from Keystring. For Father’s Day on Sunday, additional activities will include raw and chargrilled oysters with a full liquor bar and live music from Few Miles South from 4 to 7 p.m. For updates and more information, visit Facebook.com/PapaJoesBayside/. Bay Fishing Panama City Inshore, docked at Papa Joe’s Bayside, offers half-day trips (four hours) for two anglers, with options to add-on hours and anglers for an additional cost. Rates include tackle, fuel, licenses, snacks and water. Panama City Beach light-tackle and fly fishing guides, including Capt. Justin Leake from Discovery Channel’s “Chasin’ the Sun,” use bay boats and shallow water technical skiffs to target species such as Redfish, Mangrove Snapper, Spanish Mackerel, Trout, Jack Cravelle, and Sheepshead.

We believe church is a place for the broken to become healed not a museum for saints. This brokenness is at times messy and painful. It is the way it's supposed to be in this portion of the journey of life to real life. Christ's love and our love for Him are the rails that keep us on the right track towards those round about us. The following pun is intentional: without this love we will rail against each other. The New Testament is in many ways a book of relationship; a how to be in relationship with God and a how to be in relationship with others. Many churches have their doctrinal distinctives, we do as well, but a distinctive that we are striving for is simply to like and to love one another, to strive (to quote Paul) to bear the weakness of one another and to not just please ourselves. We aren't there yet but we are trying. It would be a delight to have you part of this journey with us. In this journey our goal is, even with all our imperfections and brokenness, to bring glory to Christ and to show his love to all who we meet. Hypocrisy, false fronts, playing church, hiding hurts, walking alone must all cease. Our hunger is to become the church that God has always wanted us to be.
