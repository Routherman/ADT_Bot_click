Within the retail store, Howard featured approximately 40-50 artists and crafters on consignment, which was a unique and successful endeavor all on its own. In an effort to bring in the business, he strategically placed a 6-foot-4-inch gorilla named Magilla out on the street. Even better, the ever-prominently displayed Magilla featured signs that said it was running for Mayor. Needless to say, the active Mayor was not happy that he was being poked fun at, and had Howard arrested. The brilliant publicity stunt to promote the store not only worked, it landed Howard and Magilla on several local TV news stations, as well as Good Morning America and PM Magazine. Found guilty of \"having something illegal on the street,\" Howard was warned that he may have to pay a $500 fine, serve probation, and donate Magilla, who had become a celebrity to various charities and organizations for a 6-month period. Through the whole ordeal, Howard realized he had a knack for advertising and public relations. Combining his newly discovered talent and his passion for the arts, Howard created Howard Alan Events, a public relations and advertising agency specializing in art show promotions. Howard’s first show was in a Boca Raton housing development during the dead heat of summer. Let's just say it was a great learning experience. Howard also started promoting craft shows in shopping centers, in conjunction with bands, classic cars and beauty pageants. Approximately 100 exhibitors were featured. It was a serious struggle, but Howard was determined to make it work. The rest, as they say, is history. Today, Howard Alan is one of the most widely and highly recognized art fair promoters in the industry. Along with Debbie, his wife and business partner of 40 years and their dedicated staff, Howard runs 45 annual juried art shows and 40 annual craft shows out of a small office in Jupiter, Florida. No matter which corner of the nation you visit you are sure to find a Howard Alan event somewhere, be it Aspen, Pittsburgh, Alexandria, Cleveland, Ft. Lauderdale or Sarasota, just to name a few. These popular outdoor festivals are consistently ranked among the top art shows in the country. And with all the shows came all the artists. Over the last 40 years, Howard Alan is proud to have exhibited the work of over 10,000 different artists worldwide. Today, a typical Howard Alan show will feature anywhere from 100 to upwards of 300 exhibitors. These artists are like family to Howard and Debbie and many have been with them since the very beginning. Many credit Howard Alan for allowing them to make a living doing what they love most. Sitting sidecar through all of this is Magilla, well at least his head, which Howard keeps at his office for  good luck. And no matter how many shows in the schedule or how large the staff grows, Howard Alan Events is still a family business that cares about its exhibitors. In fact, Howard and Debbie still travel and coordinate many of their own shows. It is not uncommon to see them at 5am assisting exhibitors with setup, or offering a little pep talk on selling or booth display. It is this consistency of commitment and quality that has created a faithful following among artists and customers.

The Arts Alliance has obtained the Cultural District Designation for Lubbock—one of only 53 cities in the State of Texas—resulting in over $2 million in grant funding for local non-profit arts organizations. In addition, the Arts Alliance has received numerous direct grant awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, Texas Commission on the Arts, and Texas Women for the Arts. Most recently, Grigsby finalized a $1 million endowment to support the operating costs of the Lubbock Arts Alliance and the Lubbock Arts Festival, further strengthening the organization’s long-term sustainability.

Some Highlights at the Conference Artificial Intelligence for Art Show Directors AI is already part of the tools many arts leaders use daily. But as generative AI steps into the spotlight, show organizers are faced with new challenges and possibilities: How do we use these tools to increase capacity without compromising our artistic values or community trust? This session offers a jargon-free introduction to AI tailored for leaders, especially those navigating limited staff and high expectations. Led by a practitioner who supports festivals nationwide, this conversation blends practical strategy with ethical grounding. What we’ll explore: Time-saving tools for grant research, volunteer onboarding, emergency communications, and marketing A plain-language overview of how different types of AI work (and what to watch for) Frameworks for ethical and transparent use of AI in creative communities. Thoughtful ways to respond to skepticism from artists, staff, or board members S. David Ramirez, CFEE, is an award-winning marketing and event technologist based in San Antonio. He is the founder and CEO of SDMRamirez, an agency working with events, entrepreneurs, and economic development organizations across the nation. He is a sought-after speaker, presenting at dozens of events and conferences each year. He serves on the boards of the International Festivals and Events Association Foundation and the Texas Festivals and Events Association. He is a faculty member teaching marketing and technology topics at the National Event Management School in Wheeling, West Virginia, and the Texas Event Management Institute. Mostly, he’s a nerd. Talk to him about anime, craft beers, and science fiction. Creating & Implementing Immersive Experiences at Festivals: A Hands-on How-To In this hands-on workshop, participants will explore the core components of immersive and experiential design. From imagination to implementation, educational creative and experiential designer Ashley “Birdie” will guide attendees through a step-by-step process for crafting meaningful, high-impact festival experiences. Through real-world examples, interactive exercises, and collaborative ideation, participants will gain practical tools and creative inspiration to design immersive environments that captivate audiences and keep them coming back. Through her organizations Blooming with Birdie and non-profit Project Bloom, she shares her expertise as an experiential designer, consultant, and certified Montessori educator by designing innovative learning experiences that inspire curiosity and compassion for life.  Blooming with Birdie’s flagship event, The Monarch Butterfly and Pollinator Festival marks its 10 year anniversary in 2025 . Under Birdie’s leadership and innovative approach to immersive installations,  the Festival has seen exponential growth with the 2024 event engaging over 10,000 community members. Fundamentals of Grant Writing: Planning, Budgeting, and Telling Your Story The world of grants can be challenging.  This session with Stacy Keith, Director of the Lubbock Cultural Arts Foundation, will discuss how to research grants and develop a proposal.  It will include developing a budget, narrative, appropriate evaluation tools and examining sustainability.  Content will also discuss the importance of Board and partner involvement to strengthen an application and how to work collaboratively to engage those who are responsible for budget oversite, implementation and reporting.

Please specify which show you are paying for on the form. You may also mail a check made out to Howard Alan Events and mail to office. Cancellation Policy Cancellations must be made in writing (preferably emailed) at least 60 DAYS prior to the show. If you cancel with the proper amount of notice, you will receive a show credit for all show fees paid, good for 2 years toward another invitation. Application fees are non-refundable. If you cancel within 60 days of the show, you are liable for the balance and will not receive a credit. We do not, at any time, issue refunds unless we have cancelled a show with ample time prior to its scheduled date. If a show is canceled AFTER logistical and advertising arrangements have been made, refunds will not be issued under our rain or shine policy nor due to any forces of nature, (i.e., hurricanes, tornados, floods, earthquakes) as outlined in the application. If you are not paid in full at this time, you are still liable for the balance. You will not be able to exhibit in a future Howard Alan Event until the show balance has been paid. We understand that there are many unforeseen circumstances that may arise last minute, however, we cannot make exceptions to this policy. Exhibitor Standards Artwork must be original, handcrafted, and directly created and showcased by the approved individual artist or through a collaboration between two artists. The participation of teams or companies is prohibited. The artist whose work has been accepted is required to be present throughout the event to engage with patrons. Subletting or sharing of space is prohibited. The use of kits, imported goods, or mass-produced items is strictly prohibited. The artwork images and booth display you apply with must be up-to-date and consistent with what you will set up at the event. One medium only per booth is permitted; any medium not approved during the application process that appears in your booth at an event will be removed. Howard Alan Events allows a limited quantity of offset prints, giclees, and reproduced work that must be clearly labeled as such. AI Usage Policy for Exhibiting Artists & Craft Artisans With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the art world, it has become increasingly important to maintain clarity, transparency, and fairness in our festivals. While AI can be a valuable tool for inspiration, our focus remains on celebrating the original, handcrafted work of exhibiting artists. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the creative process is permitted for inspiration and idea development only. Any use of AI must be disclosed as part of the application process. Artwork submitted for exhibition must be the original, handcrafted creation of the artist. Works generated mainly by AI are not eligible for participation. For digital art submissions, applicants may be required to provide additional proof of creation (such as process images, screen captures, or other documentation), as this medium can be more difficult to distinguish in its final form. No Solicitation Exhibitors are present at our shows for the purpose of representing and selling their work. No exhibitor is permitted to engage in any type of solicitation of any products, supplies, outside events or any other non-related business activities during the event.  Failure to comply will cause possible expulsion from the show. Liability Insurance All exhibitors selling food for human or pet consumption AND exhibitors selling products that are applied to the skin (soap, skin care, etc.) are required to have product liability insurance. A one million dollar liability insurance policy, complete with Product Liability Insurance, naming Howard Alan Events, Inc. and American Craft Endeavors as co-insured, indemnified, and held harmless in the event of damage of property, injury, death, alleged sickness from food/skin care product, and any other damages or claims, suits, etc., shall be in force and on file in our office prior to being in attendance at an event. Taxes Each exhibitor is responsible for collecting the state sales tax and filing a report with the local Department of Revenue. Show Information Packet If invited and after show fee/deposit has been made, the show information packet will be sent by email. The information will include all details of the event. Set-up and breakdown times will be strictly enforced. This information supersedes all information on Zapp/JAS. Booth information: Displays must be professional and aesthetically pleasing. All tents MUST be white . Booth spaces are approximately 10' wide by 10' deep. Double booths are available on a limited basis. If invited, your booth display at the event should match the booth display picture that was submitted with your Zapp application. There are no exceptions to this rule. If you have any display changes prior to the festival, you must resubmit your booth image for approval. Artists must use appropriate professional display systems like pro panels or heavy mesh walls. Grid walls, and temporary mesh walls will not be permitted. Your setup should be both professional and robust, ensuring safety and functionality. Draped tables are prohibited at our art festivals (but they can be used at our craft festivals). You may use a small, finished designer-style table made of wood, glass, or metal, such as a sofa or accent table. Pro Panel-style desks, pedestals, or proper display pedestals are permitted. Handwritten signs, sale signs and award ribbons from other events are strictly prohibited. We encourage you to check the display requirements section on our website for helpful suggestions and tips. Exhibitors will leave their exhibit space clean after packing up at break down. If your space is not clean after an event, you may be expelled from future shows. Exhibitors are responsible for making their tents sturdy against wind, rain, etc. (40lb weights per tent leg is required). Tents MUST be manufactured with a certificate of flame-retardant materials. Staking into the ground is not permitted. Howard Alan Events is not responsible for lost, damaged or stolen property. All work, display and storage may not go beyond the assigned exhibitor space. Please contact The Tent Guys (561-374-1783) for rentals. If you plan on renting a tent and/or full display, please note this on your application. Refund Policy THERE ARE NO REFUNDS FOR CANCELLED SHOWS! However, a credit good for 2 years from the cancellation date will be issued to your account if you notify the office more than 60 days before the event date. The exhibitor is responsible for the entire show fee if the event is cancelled with less than 60 days prior to the show and you will not receive a credit. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule! If you cancel an event within 60 days of the show date, you are liable for the show balance. You will not be able to exhibit in a future event until the show balance has been paid.  All cancellations MUST be in writing (email preferred). There are no rain dates. There will be no refunds or credits if a show is cancelled due to rain, floods, hurricanes, or any other forces of nature after logistics and advertising have been arranged! Legal Agreement: The undersigned does hereby discharge, release and hold harmless, HOWARD ALAN EVENTS, INC. & AMERICAN CRAFT ENDEAVORS (all cities, property owners, and associations) and all co-sponsors from any and all manner of action, suits, damages, or claims whatsoever arising from any loss or damages or claims, to the person or property of the undersigned while in possession or under the supervision of the sponsors during the Festival, and hereby consents to enforcement of all rules of this event.

Log In MED CITY ART FESTIVAL August 22, 2025 Peace Plaza, Rochester, MN ​ MED CITY ART FESTIVAL Est. 2019 The Med City Art Festival is a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization that relies on contributions from individuals, agencies, and foundations to support the development of our programs, including exhibitions, outreach initiatives, and the festival. ​ MISSION Med City Art Festival is a cross-cultural art festival that aims to inform and educate our attendees through a wide range of cultural and artistic experiences that engage, excite, and inspire them. MACF provides a space to showcase artists’ original work across multiple platforms. ​ VISSION Bring people together to cultivate an atmosphere where passion fuels business and opens minds. ​ GOALS Our primary goal is to empower emerging and professional artists to address their artistic needs for expression, exposure, and revenue by providing them with the space and context to do so. Additionally, Med City Art Festival aims to make “art” accessible to the general public and integrate “art” with downtown businesses. ​ INSPIRATION Art is everywhere…, but only a few can see it, and even fewer can transform what we see into a representation of it.  However, that doesn’t mean that ART is not available to all. It’s a matter of developing the techniques and skills needed to thrive as an artist. We believe anyone can express themselves on diverse art platforms by learning to see art and developing their skills. Art is our passion. It enriches life and feeds the soul. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES The Med City Art Festival allows emerging artists to experiment within the public domain. MCAF also encourages professional artists to pursue their creativity and individuality by participating in our free annual festival as vendors, performers, or teaching artists (TAs). Support our volunteers in their efforts and provide a distinctive experience for the public. VALUES (Board approved on 12/10/21) Our values reflect our core beliefs within the MCAF culture. We choose four words that best represent our values, who we are, and the tools and circumstances we face and see in the world around us. These values embody a cluster of qualities that can be expressed in various ways (please refer to our Code of Ethics and Conduct* for further insights into our organization’s culture). Integrity We maintain and strengthen the trust of our customers, including donors, agencies, sponsors, partners, vendors, artists, and the community. Elements that guide and uphold our integrity include dependability, loyalty, honesty, respect, and good judgment. Equity We value the intentional inclusion of everyone in our community. We make a great effort to dismantle systemic, institutional, and historical barriers based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other identities so they no longer determine the outcomes. Elements that guide and strengthen our equity: identify and interrupt exclusionary bias; focus on the impact and talent of actions and decisions, not their intent. Take personal and organizational responsibility for creating a culture where individuals with diverse identities and experiences feel a sense of belonging and can thrive. Excellence Our goal is to consistently surpass our customers’ expectations. Elements that guide and strengthen our excellence include being forward-thinking, focusing on opportunities rather than problems, paying attention to detail, producing high-quality work, and continuously developing and applying new knowledge and skills. Accountability We take personal responsibility at all levels of our organization. Elements that guide and straighten our accountability include consistently raising our standards, staying focused on results—especially when challenges arise—and clearly and consistently communicating expectations and priorities. WHO WE ARE We are a small group of volunteers who come together each year to organize an annual art festival at Peace Plaza in downtown Rochester, MN. As artists, we seek to provide a rich and fulfilling cultural experience. If you would like to join us and volunteer with MCAF, please email info@medcityartfestival.org to receive more information about volunteer opportunities. Med City Art Festival 1101 7th Ave SW. Rochester, MN The event is at Peace Plaza 1st Ave SW & 1st St SW (Street Level), Rochester, MN, United States, 55901 Please email info@MedCityArtsFestival.org or use our text line: 507-250-3556​​​​ MCAF Sponsors bottom of page"
