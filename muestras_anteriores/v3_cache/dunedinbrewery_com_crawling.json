      "text": "About Us — Noisy Brewing Co. 0 Skip to Content Brewery & Taproom Menu About Shop Contact Open Menu Close Menu Brewery & Taproom Menu About Shop Contact Open Menu Close Menu Brewery & Taproom Menu About Shop Contact Small, crafty & sometimes a bit noisy. Noisy Brewing Co is a small, family operated brewery run by Chris, Sarah & little Juniper Noye, with brewer Adam Harris. Words by Kelly Tapper & Photography by Nancy Zhou via Neat Places Noisy Brewing Co. is a boutique brewing company making waves in  the Dunedin beer scene. Small and nimble, with an experimental and  innovative output by owner Chris Noye, who loves nothing more than  concocting a new brew. Noisy’s inception started at the end of 2017, after owner Chris and  his partner Sarah threw caution to the wind and quit their jobs to take a  year off. To do what? They weren’t sure.  Starting out as novice  homebrewers playing around in the kitchen, the fledgling idea for Noisy  was born after a mere 4 months. There’s no core range of beers here, instead they choose to make a  plethora of bold flavoursome brews, from porters to sours, pilsners to  pale ales - the mantra is diversification. And as the craft beer market  shifts and moves in a bid to cater to its fans, Noisy’s ethos certainly  seems in sync with the ever-changing landscape, sometimes remaking a  popular drop but not always, keeping everyone on their toes. Their shapeshifting line-up of beers have garnered Noisy a loyal  following in Dunedin, with a hoard of clientele regularly popping down  to the takeaway off-licence in Kenmure. Customers can have a chat with  Chris, sample new drops and pick up a selection of ales to take home.  You’ll also see their beers adorning taps at hospitality places across  the city, including Carey’s Bay Hotel, Ombrellos, Eureka and  Sessions Bar. Chris recently made an Imperial Stout which is now aging in whiskey  barrels for a year. For him it’s about the long burn. We certainly hope  Noisy Brewing Co. is a long burn too. 7 Anzac Ave, Dunedin 9016  •   info@noisybrew.co.nz"
