Stay up to date with our facebook! Give us a like. Frescos Southern Kitchen A place to gather with friends and family, sip a handcrafted cocktail, and enjoy some authentic southern cooking. Located on the corner of Lemon & Kentucky in downtown Lakeland, we’re serving up a combination of modern and traditional southern eats seven days a week. Known for our weekend boozy brunch with bottomless mimosas, the best bourbon & whisky selection around, and food that comforts & heals the soul – we’ll be sure to save a seat for you! Chef Tina Calhoon is a Florida native – born in Jacksonville and raised in Ocala. Her maternal roots hail from the south and include many days spent in the kitchen with her mom learning the cooking basics and giving her the best kind of culinary education…a real world one. This hands-on culinary training allowed Tina to build on her southern roots to create unique, new southern dishes, as well as regional and ethnic offerings that appeal to all palates. Tina and her husband Tim, Frescos’ Director of Spirits and Entertainment, opened the doors to Frescos in 2009 with a vision that has seen them through three restaurant expansions over the last 10 years. Frescos has gone from small bistro to downtown destination, helping to revitalize the Downtown Lakeland dining scene while paving the way for other boutique restaurants to establish themselves here. Tina believes that with good food comes comfort and happiness. THAT is the Frescos’ philosophy and tradition that she continues to build on – offering warm, southern hospitality and creating an experience through food that brings joy to others ADDRESS 132 S Kentucky Ave Lakeland,  33801 CONTACT INFO info@frescoslakeland.com 863-683-5267 Visit Website TripAdvisor Traveler Rating 300 reviews JUL 4, 2025 07:38:24 We chose Fresco’s based on the inviting images on their website and the varied menu that seemed perfect for our party of eight.
