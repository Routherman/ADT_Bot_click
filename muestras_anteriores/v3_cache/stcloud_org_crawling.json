(1937-) Jump to: Who Is Anthony Hopkins? Quick Facts Early Life and Acting Career Movies Personal Life Alcoholism Who Is Anthony Hopkins? Anthony Hopkins pursued a stage career before working in film in the late 1960s. Known for a variety of projects ranging from The Dawning to The Remains of the Day to Amistad , Hopkins has been nominated for several Oscars, winning for The Silence of the Lambs and The Father . His more fantastical work includes Titus , The Mask of Zorro and Thor, as well as Westworld. Quick Facts FULL NAME: Philip Anthony Hopkins BORN: December 31, 1937 BIRTHPLACE: Margam, Port Talbot, Wales SPOUSE: Stella Arroyave (m. 2003), Jennifer Lynton (m. 1973–2002), Petronella Barker (m. 1966–1972) CHILDREN: Abigail Hopkins ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn Early Life and Acting Career Philip Anthony Hopkins was born on December 31, 1937, in Margam, Port Talbot, Wales. Hopkins is the son of Muriel Yeats — a distant relative of the Irish poet William Butler Yeats — and Richard Hopkins. His early years in Wales and schooling at Cowbridge Grammar School were relatively unremarkable, but when the soon-to-be actor met Richard Burton , the course of his life would dramatically change. Encouraged and inspired by Burton, Hopkins enrolled at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama when he was only 15 years old. After graduation in 1957, Hopkins spent two years in the British Army before moving to London to begin training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After training and working for several years, he became a kind of protégé of the legendary actor Sir Laurence Olivier . In 1965 Olivier invited Hopkins to join the Royal National Theatre and become his understudy. The famed actor wrote in his memoir, \"A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.\" When Olivier came down with appendicitis during a production called Dance of Death , the young Hopkins stepped in, making waves with his performance. Billed as Olivier's heir to the British acting throne, Hopkins had the momentum to make the leap from stage to film, which was his primary ambition. He started on the small screen in 1967 with a BBC production of A Flea in Her Ear . Soon after he was cast in The Lion in Winter (1968) as Richard I, sharing the screen with established stars Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn . Throughout the 1970s, Hopkins continued to work in film and on stage, garnering critical attention for this double duty. He starred in a Broadway production of Peter Shaffer's Equus (1974) even as he devoted more and more attention to developing his talents for television and film. His method of preparation for roles has always been a source of fascination for critics and young actors alike. Hopkins prefers to memorize his lines in extremis, sometimes repeating them more than 200 times. The finished product typically reveals a naturalness that skillfully hides the massive amount of rehearsal the actor has done. Because of this style, Hopkins prefers fewer, more spontaneous takes, and has occasionally butted heads with directors who he perceives as deviating from the script too much or demanding too many takes. He has noted in the past that once he says a line and is done with a take, he forgets that line forever. Movies Hopkins' career began heating up in the 1970s and '80s. He won an Emmy  for his role as Bruno Richard Hauptmann in The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case (1976).  Throughout the 1980s, Hopkins continued to impress the critics with his  work in film and TV, winning multiple Emmy Awards and a BAFTA Award. 'The Silence of the Lambs' as Hannibal Lecter In  1989, Hopkins returned to the stage for a production of the musical drama M.  Butterfly . But it was in 1991 that Hopkins, now well into his fifties,  finally found himself shot to superstardom. His unforgettable, 17-minute  performance as the infamous psychopath Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the  Lambs frightened and wowed fans and critics alike. At the time he took  the role, Hopkins had been considering giving up on movies and retiring  to London for a career on the stage. The fortuitous role resulted in not  only an Oscar but a distinguished place in the popular consciousness as  perhaps the most memorable on-screen villain of all time. 'The Remains of the Day' Hopkins has since played the role again in the film's sequels. On the heels of his first  real Hollywood blockbuster, Hopkins wisely chose to follow up with his  film The Remains of the Day (1993), for which he was nominated for  another Academy Award. He would be nominated again for Nixon (1995) and Amistad (1997). In 1993 Hopkins was knighted by the British Empire.

'Westworld,' 'The Two Popes,' 'The Father' Hopkins played the biblical character Methuselah in Noah (2014) and also appeared in Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) as Sir Edmund Burton.

      "text": "2 locals on Park Board's short list Local News Sports Opinion NKY Things To Do Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals NEWS 2 locals on Park Board's short list Mark Wert mwert@enquirer.com The panel searching for a new Cincinnati Parks director got a list of finalists Wednesday. It now must decide which of the 12 it wants to interview. The city's Board of Park Commissioners is seeking a replacement for longtime Director Willie Carden, who is eligible to retire June 1. Dianne Rosenberg, the park board president, hopes to have the replacement named before Carden's departure. The finalists for the job, which will have an annual salary of $155,000, are: Chandra Brown, the Cincinnati Public Schools' budget director Peter Bratt, a manager for the Dallas parks department John Deatrick, the leader of The Banks and streetcar projects Yvette Hartsfield, former parks and recreation director for Yonkers, New York Cordell Hopkins, a former area manager for the Chicago Parks District Clisby Jennelle, the CFO for the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Parks and Recreation Keith McClintock, former vice president of the Western Reserve Land Conservancy in northeast Ohio Steve Messerli, former director of two suburban Chicago county parks districts Todd Reese, parks and grounds superintendent for Oklahoma City Jeremy Rogers, the parks and recreation director for Kansas City, Kansas, and Wyandotte County Ryan Smith, the former event operations director of Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium Wade Walcutt, parks and recreation director for Greensboro, North Carolina A review of the 75 resumes received by GovHR USA, the suburban Chicago search firm hired by the Park Board to help find a new director, shows that 34 of the 63 candidates that didn't make the finalist list had neither parks nor governmental experience. Another six had governmental experience, but not in parks. No Cincinnati or Hamilton County parks employees applied. In addition to placing ads in journals and websites for parks professionals, the consultant looked for and attempted to recruit candidates from park systems with the Gold Medal designation, said Charles Balling, a GovHR vice president. It's awarded in an annual program run by the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration and the National Recreation and Park Association. Cincinnati's parks won such a gold medal in 1971; its recreation department took the medal in 1997. Rosenberg, who is leading the search panel, noted that the search firm had canvassed more than 40 stakeholders in January before the firm created and posted a list of 13 qualifications and 13 attributes sought in candidates. A list of the contacted stakeholders included current and former park commissioners, city administrators, Mayor John Cranley and City Council members, parks staff, Cincinnati Parks Foundation staff and board members, plus Hamilton County parks Director Jack Sutton, Cincinnati Center City Development Corp. chief Steve Leeper, four members of individual park advisory councils and three other parks advocates. Searches for two other high-profile local public jobs – for a new city fire chief and a new Cincinnati Public Schools superintendent – include using websites to gather public comments on what qualities that the public wants for those new leaders. The director search committee previously had held one meeting at the private Queen City Club and used the telephone on other occasions to talk business. Ohio laws require a government meeting be held in a place where members of the public and the media may attend. A reporter from The Enquirer attended Wednesday's meeting. Heidi Voorhees, a co-owner of the search firm, told the committee that at least one person dropped out of consideration after learning that the applicant resumes had been made public at The Enquirer's request under the state's Open Records Act. \"The public needs to know that,\" said Park Commissioner Susan Castellini, a member of the search panel. The park board is paying the search firm up to $40,000 for its work. CHANGES AHEAD? Cincinnati Parks officials, responding to a recent critical state audit, could soon adopt a better way to keep its books and reach an agreement among the city, the parks and the Cincinnati Parks Foundation on various issues, including bidding and procurement. Park Board President Dianne Rosenberg told a City Council committee Tuesday that converting the parks to a double-entry accounting system would not require hiring additional staff and therefore could be done sooner than first thought. Parks officials previously had said shifting to the new system, already used by other city departments as a check on the movement of money, couldn't happen until the 2019 fiscal year. Adopting a double-entry system, which Rosenberg called \"the standard\" for such work, would be on the agenda for the board's April meeting, the board president said. The shift was called for in a 2016 external audit of the parks, in the wake of Enquirer reporting about Park Board procedures and practices, including an inappropriate $200,000 campaign donation for a proposed parks levy voters ultimately turned down in 2015. A state audit last month concurred in the need for a double-entry system. City Manager Harry Black last year had been trying to work out an agreement with the Park Board that would require that the department transfer any money it planned to spend on the park system into the city’s financial system, as every other city department does. Black wanted the city to be sure all of the money spent by the board follows bidding and procurement laws. The move also would curb the use of master service agreements instead of bidding to award contracts, as was done for millions of dollars in work at Smale Riverfront Park. Talks for an agreement broke down over Park Board members' concern they would lose control over nine endowments benefitting the parks for which they serve as trustees. Rosenberg spoke to the council Audit and Rules Committee after interrupting a meeting with Mayor John Cranley and other city officials on reaching an agreement. She told the committee that talks were proceeding, but that an agreement wasn't imminent.

Last year she sold 14 homes worth a total of $9MM. Four of those homes sold for well over $1MM with the highest selling for $2,560,000; the most affordable she sold was a co-op in Evanston for $85k. No matter the price, she works equally hard for all of her clients, as their exclusive fiduciary. Before becoming a broker, Marissa served for 20 years as an executive corporate strategist. Her expertise was new product development and brand building. As such, she sold and implemented strategies to help Fortune 500 companies grow. This relates to selling homes in many ways. Here are two examples. First, your home is a one-of-a-kind product. What she sells is the experience, and how it will fulfill the buyers' dreams. She understands the consumer psyche and knows how to appeal to it on an emotional level. Home buying is emotional. Each home she lists tells the story of what made your home special in your life. This helps create marketing communications that connect to buyers' hearts and minds, and conjures images of themselves living in your home. An excellent, and extreme example of this would be how she sold the 'Home Alone' home in Winnetka. See www.MarissaHopkins.com for examples. Second, to get the highest price and close a deal takes a skilled and experienced salesperson. Marissa is time-tested as an outstanding negotiator and a successful real estate professional who can pivot, grow with the times, and work with you all the way to the closing table to complete a deal. Since 2005 she's experienced the real estate market go through high highs and low lows, and has embraced the exponential advances in technology. She worked and sold homes throughout the COVID shutdown, and knows how to manage, present clearly, and advise her clients on however many offers they receive so they can make an informed decision that is best for them. Finally, on a very personal note, Marissa is passionate about loving life at home and protecting the environment. She teaches classes on urban farming. She and her husband, Dan, grow hundreds of pounds of fresh vegetables every summer in their backyard and thousands of flowers for the bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. Marissa is a certified EcoBroker and NAR Green Designee, which qualifies her to identify and market your home's high-performance features and advise on ways to conserve energy, natural resources and money at home. Marissa's home is her sanctuary. She is committed to helping people find their own perfect home, to love where they live, and to work with them to successfully move forward when it's time to move to a new home. Marissa is a service-first, creative broker who has succeeded in all the North Shore real estate markets. Her steadfast approach is invaluable in helping her clients make informed decisions, whatever their real estate goals may be. She has been recognized for her accomplishments, as highlighted below: Awarded Chicago Magazine's prestigious 5-Star Professional for outstanding sales and service 11 years in a row @properties Christie's International Real Estate \"Attitude\" Sales Success Award for sales of $9MM in 2022 Awarded the Top Agent Award for the Fastest Growing Business in the first half of 2022, with over $9M in sales last year on the North Shore Certified Eco-Broker® a certification to provide professional guidance and resources regarding energy and resource conservation at home Awarded \"Working to Make American Better\" from the Illinois Association of REALTORS® Served as a Commissioner for the Highland Park and Lake County Housing Commissions Serves as a Trustee for North Shore Congregation Israel Serves as an election judge and has done so for over 26 years in both Cook and Lake Counties Mom of two kids: one is pursuing three PhDs in Creative Technology, Neuroscience and Cognitive Behavior at CU Boulder, the other is an attorney.
