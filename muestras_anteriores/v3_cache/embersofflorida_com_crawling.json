They were \"roommates\" at a Junior League conference and realized that her husband's cousin was Susannah's aunt. Charles, June's husband, and I have joked for years and called each other \"Cuz.\" When they were looking for artwork for the restaurant, June contact Susannah and offered the restaurant as a gallery. Susannah had a blast finding the perfect prints for Embers and hosted 3 solo art shows in the beautiful outdoor area. Embers is a favorite of Susannah's- the pan seared sea bass and the gator tail are her personal favorites. Embers Wood Grill is a haven for those seeking a unique and flavorful dining experience.  This restaurant isn't your average grill; it's a celebration of the magic of open-fire cooking, where fresh, seasonal ingredients are transformed into culinary masterpieces through the mastery of wood smoke.  From the inviting aroma that greets you at the door to the explosion of textures and tastes on your palate, Embers Wood Grill offers an unforgettable dining experience that goes beyond the ordinary. A Passion Ignited: The Story Behind the Embers Embers Wood Grill's story began with a passion for open-fire cooking and a desire to share it with the Gainesville community.  The founders, Chef Britton Dumas, June & Charles Allen and Sommelier Ryan Todd, inspired by the time-honored techniques of grilling and smoking over wood flames, envisioned a restaurant that showcased the unique flavor profile and versatility of this cooking method.  Their commitment to quality extends beyond the open fire; they source fresh, seasonal ingredients from local farms, ensuring each dish is bursting with flavor and crafted with care. An Ambiance as Warm as the Fire: Immersing Yourself in the Embers Experience Step inside Embers Wood Grill and prepare to be enveloped by a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The open kitchen allows you to witness the culinary magic firsthand, as chefs expertly maneuver ingredients over crackling flames.  The exposed brick walls and rustic décor create a sense of casual sophistication, while the aroma of wood smoke hangs in the air, whetting your appetite for the delectable dishes to come. A Dance with Fire: Unveiling the Delights of the Embers Menu The menu at Embers Wood Grill is a testament to the versatility and power of wood-fired cooking.  Each dish is thoughtfully crafted to highlight the unique smoky flavor imparted by the open fire: Starters: Enjoy gator tail or pan seared fois gras as a delicious, mouth-watering starter. The Art of Open-Fire Cooking: The heart of Embers Wood Grill lies in their selection of wood-fired main courses. From succulent steaks and chops to perfectly cooked seafood, each dish showcases the mastery of open-fire cooking. The signature steak is a must-try, boasting a perfectly charred exterior and a juicy, flavorful interior. For seafood lovers, the wood-roasted salmon with a lemon-herb crust is a delightful option.

Embers Wood Grill holds one of the top spots in our steakhouse book for the perfect blend of fine dining, superior service, and, most importantly, dangerously, delectable dishes. With so many prime choices on their menu, it can be hard to decide what to order. We’ll make it easy for you. Here is a list of our top choices at Embers. For a list of other recommendations in Gainesville download our Vacation Guide ! Access Your Guide to Gainesville Sesame and Pepper Crusted #1 Loin Yellowfin Tuna Since our city is between Cedar Key and St. Augustine, it’s no wonder this authentic ahi made the list. Embers Wood Grill uses the highest grade yellowfin, cut directly from the center block offering you the heartiest filet of fish possible. Top that with mango-sweet pepper slaw and a rice wine reduction and you won’t want to leave a morsel behind. We should mention that owner Ryan Todd, certified by the Court of Master Sommeliers, boasts a nine-time award-winning wine list from Wine Spectator Magazine . You’ll want to pair this yellowfin tuna dish with a savory, dry French rosé, and you’re in good hands with the selections. Flaming Crème Brulee Save room for dessert. Visit only for dessert. Eat dessert for an appetizer. It doesn’t matter how you do it, but you must order this luscious, flame-broiled treat. The vanilla custard will arrive flaming in the sweet orange aroma of Grand Marnier. The moment you crack the crispy shell on top to the moment the waiter pulls the dish from your table goes quickly. Trust us, you’ll only need one spoon. Gulf of Mexico Blue Crab Bisque Rich, hearty, and fresh. Crafted flawlessly, the cream-based bisque combines hints of tart white wine with a generous portion of blue crab and is topped off with a crusty grilled crostini. This stout bisque would make for a perfectly paired surf and turf with the prime porterhouse. Braised Beef Short Ribs Get back to basics with this meat and potato meal. The succulent, robust ribs are roasted with an entire head of garlic and basked in caramelized onions. Pair it with Ember’s delectable lobster mashed potatoes, and a Woodford Reserve Old Fashioned. Dine to the relaxing sounds of the streaming fountain on the outdoor patio, and you’ll have a night to remember. And, of Course, the 10-ounce Prime Filet Mignon Hand-cut from the center of the tenderloin, this perfectly seared and seasoned piece of meat will take your steak game from backyard grill-mate to culinary expert with the flip of a spatula. All steaks are cooked over a wood fire grill to your liking, but we recommend ordering this one rare. Cooked deliberately and at a low temperature, this prime, center-cut meat will melt in your mouth like exquisite velvet without the typical runniness of a rare-cooked steak. Pair it with the truffled mac and cheese and sautéed diver scallops. Yum. Stay at Sweetwater Branch Inn! Ready to call it a night?
