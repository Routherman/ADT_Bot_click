Our beautiful city is one of the oldest port cities in the state of Florida. Established in 1831, Apalachicola boosts a rich and unique past. Glimpses of that by-gone era can still be viewed today through our charming shops, inviting parks, historic museums and acclaimed restaurants serving fresh locally-caught seafood. Additional maritime life is evident through picturesque Scipio Creek which flows into a vast ecosystem where the vital Apalachicola River meets the Apalachicola Bay, creating a natural and pristine estuary that eventually flows into the Gulf of Mexico. This special place I call home is truly a gem and I am honored to serve as its first female mayor, a position I do not take lightly. As mayor, I am tasked with serving my fellow residents, working alongside my friends, and being an ambassador for our visitors. These are roles I eagerly embrace for I am proud to be a representative of such a remarkable city. The name “Apalachicola” is said to mean . . . “land of friendly people.” Living and working together with my fellow Apalachicolians, I can completely vouch for the accuracy of that label and as our city continues to grow and prosper, it is my desire that the same inviting charm that intrigued you to live, work, play and visit here, will seep into your spirit and keep you here. Again, welcome to our historic city.

Rentals Battery Park City Manhattan Queens Long Island Commercial Open House About Us About Us Our Neighborhood Buildings Contact Us About Us Dear Friends, I am a resident & investor of Battery Park City (BPC) for over 20 years. As the President and Founder of Battery Park Realty (BPR), we specialize in downtown Manhattan real estate sales & rentals.  BPR has successfully sold over 100 units in three new green buildings: Millennium Tower, Visionaire, River House & Rector Park. We have sold more units in BPC than any other brokerage firm in New York.  We have also completed many resales and rentals in the area.  Our experience in BPC is unsurpassed. I would like to share with you my experience and views of real estate in New York City. BPC residential condominium prices have tripled in the last 20 years. The population and sales prices for properties almost doubled in five years after 9/11/2001. The Wall Street crisis and recession of 2008 created another bottom in the market. BPC currently houses 60,000 individuals. According to professional real estate analysis data and estimates from Downtown Alliance, over 200,000 people are projected to be working in the new World Trade Center towers along with over half a million residents. In addition, three quality public schools make BPC highly attractive to families. There is no doubt the downtown waterfront is one of the most valuable places to live and to work with its spectacular harbor views. BPC also has a wonderful overall quality of life, an oasis of calm in the midst of the city's commotion. Rental prices have increased over 10-20% in the past few years. Stock market are at their highest since 2008. Most projections estimate that real estate prices in NYC overall will rise in this summer. There currently are not many new residential developments underway. My advice to interested buyers is to focus on upcoming attractive investment opportunities before this summer. Most of our BPR team lives in downtown. We aim to serve the community in achieving the best sales and rental results for our clients as well as in providing property management. Please feel free to call us at 212-786-1789 for questions regarding property sales, valuation, or your investment and rental needs. Best Regards, Margaret Liu President Battery Park Realty, Inc. © 2025\t\t 21 South End Avenue New York, NY 100280\n\t\t 212.786.1789 / Fax 212.945.4688 info@batteryparkrealty.com Fair Housing Notice"

I think the price is a little high for a piece of grass and no services. I guess they had a bathroom in a building close by. There is a box that you pay for you night stay as you come into the park. Don't park near the water (non grass area) because there is a ferry that brings people in from a dredging barge all times day and night so it can be a little noisy. It was quite closer to the marina side.  Apalachicola is a lovely town to shop and even just look around.

The city police officer who greeted us claimed that $50 was \"a good deal because of the cost of hotels around here.\"  They used to take cash as well but now have switched to a credit-only kiosk. The parking lot consists of a dirt portion and a grass portion.  You can park in either.  It's underneath a high, busy bridge.  Construction is currently occurring in the area and the officer also warned that construction traffic would be coming and going at all hours of the night. We were there on a Tuesday evening in February and there was only one other RVer present.  The officer says it fills up on the weekends.  It's pretty obvious by the poor condition of the parking lot and surrounding area that they're not putting any of the revenue they get back into the parking lot.

They said the sign was stollen and just hasn’t been replaced yet. They said to park anywhere in the grassy area. We put the $30 fee in the box by the boat launch. It’s kinda steep for boondocking, but it’s worth it for the location. You’re in a nice grassy area by the marina and it’s a short stroll into downtown Apalachicola where there’s tons of great restaurants and shops. The corner near the boat launch gets crowded in the morning with boat trailer parking, so I’d recommend parking toward the far south side. I took off one star for the high price and the bit of litter around. We picked up most of it. Still a great stop for a day.

Pulled up to the marina and parked on the gravel around 1300 on a Sunday.  Made a quick lunch as soon as we were ready to walk to the town, the local sheriff pulled up to ask if we were planning to stay the night. We said no, just wanted to stimulate the economy and check out the local brewery. We landed up not staying overnight, because it is $30 for dry camping. Officer said the drip box is by the boat launch ( not obvious). Great place to park for day use but not $30 dry camping worth.

This is really not Battery Park it is next to it in a gravel lot along the river. When we pulled in there was another Class A motor home parked along side the grassy area.. We parked parallel to the river.  We asked the other couple if they were staying there for the night and they said they had already spent the previous two nights there.  According to the couple they stop there on their way from Indiana to Florida and have for the past 8 years.. The woman told me no one ever bothers them. When we were there the Sheriff often came into the parking lot but never said anything to us. People have reported about signs.. The only signs we saw were on the bridge that said No Dumping of Garbage. However there are signs and boxes for $30.00 payment along the boat ramp if you are going to use a slip.  The electric that is on the boat ramps are not for RV's.  I would also suggest that you not park on the grass but in the gravel parking lot.  A big expensive motor home parked on the grass when there was plenty of space on the gravel. It is stuff like this that ruins it for those who boondock. It is a short walk to downtown Apalachicola and there is a lot of things to do.  They have a fantastic Maritime Museum that is run by donations. They have displays, and films to watch. Also they offer boat making classes.  In addition they have various river cruises and we were told we could bring our dog if it was well behaved.  If you want to rent a Kayak they offer that too.  My husband and I sat on the swing on their dock for about 1/2 hour watching the Pelicans. There is a shop called the Tin Store that has antiques and a wonderful quirky display on their lawn along with a colorful collection of buoys. Apalachicola is home one of the largest oyster reefs and their oysters are famous world wide. Before moving to Tarpon Springs, Apalachicola was known for its sponge business.  One store we visited the owner dives for sponges and he has a variety of them available for sale along with Tupelo Honey. There is also a farmers market every 2nd and 4th Saturday with a wide array of offerings..  It is right by where the fishing boats are and it was nice to walk along the pier and see the different boats and birds. While we were parked along the river we saw alligators, a sea otter, sandpipers, and pelicans. There is also a small park at the harbor, and Lafayette Park is up the street from Battery Park.  We love Apalachicola. My takeaways from out stay. Park along the river, don't leave any trash, and visit the local business.  Leave it cleaner than you found it.

Many plans for Battery Park City were proposed at the time, all with three common goals: to expand the area of Lower Manhattan, attract residents to live Downtown, and to develop additional parks & open spaces. 1968 — BPCA IS CREATED As various development plans were under review, Governor Nelson Rockefeller understood the importance of establishing an entity to oversee & maintain the project as the site matured. In 1968, he convinced the New York State Legislature to create the Battery Park City Authority as a New York State Public Benefit Corporation. 1970s — BATTERY PARK CITY TAKES SHAPE The first task of the Authority was to create the 92 acres of land for the community to be built upon. This was done by extending the Manhattan shoreline beyond the old wharves and into the Hudson River. The abundant fill from the nearby excavation of the World Trade Center was used in addition to fill dredged from the Hudson River bed. 1979 — MASTER PLAN ADOPTED The 1979 Master Plan designed by Cooper-Eckstut, saw Battery Park City as an extension of the existing NYC grid. The plan balanced commercial, residential, and retail space, while designating a third of the project site to be developed as public parks. Downloadable PDF : 1979 Master Plan 1983 — GATEWAY PLAZA Gateway Plaza, Battery Park City’s first residential complex is built. 1988 — WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER The World Financial Center complex (currently Brookfield Place) was completed. This commercial complex complemented the existing World Trade Center and solidified Lower Manhattan as a premier business hub. 1990s — ROADS AND INFASTRUCTURE Battery Park City’s roads and infrastructure are built-out to support the increased development on the project site. 2000 — SETTING STANDARDS BPCA publishes the “Residential Environmental Guidelines” to establish a process for the creation of environmentally responsible residential buildings, appreciably ahead of current standards and practices for development. These guidelines were responsible for the construction of The Solaire, the first “green” residential tower in the United States, the first in a succession of healthier, ecologically responsible buildings. 2002 — BPCA ISSUES GUIDELINES Responding to increased public awareness of environmental conservation & increased demand for healthier working environments, BPCA issues Commercial/Institutional Environmental Guidelines, providing both direction & metrics for design strategies. The resultant buildings are outstanding examples of environmental responsibility, thereby educating & influencing the real estate market & construction industry as a whole. 2004 — THE SOLAIRE The Solaire becomes the first high-rise residential building in the nation to receive the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Gold status. 2008 — THE VERDESIAN Battery Park City continues to set the bar for “green” development, as the Verdesian becomes the first condominium in New York City to earn LEED Platinum certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. TODAY — MODERN BATTERY PARK CITY The flexibility of Battery Park City’s Master Plan and its clearly defined design guidelines put it squarely on track to become one of the most successful urban renewal projects in the world. The neighborhood has grown into a well-rounded community home to more than 13,000 residents and a thriving commercial presence, encompassed by 36 acres of world class parks and open spaces. Battery Park City Authority Established in 1968, the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) was charged with developing and maintaining a well-balanced community on the Lower West Side of Manhattan, in place of deteriorating piers that once stood in the Hudson River. The project involved reclaiming the land, replanning the area, and facilitating new construction of a mixed commercial and residential community. The timeline above provides information on key events in Battery Park City’s history. Battery Park City has since achieved worldwide acclaim as a model for community renewal. Through a public/private partnership between BPCA and private developers, this planned community has become a blueprint for successful urban development. Mission Statement The Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority is a New York State public benefit corporation whose mission is to plan, create, coordinate, and sustain a balanced community of commercial, residential, retail, and park space within its designated 92-acre site on the Lower West Side of Manhattan.

Franklin County Apalachicola officials address water quality concerns by: Riley Lehman Posted: Jun 13, 2025 / 04:12 AM CDT Updated: Jun 15, 2025 / 02:23 PM CDT by: Riley Lehman Posted: Jun 13, 2025 / 04:12 AM CDT Updated: Jun 15, 2025 / 02:23 PM CDT SHARE UPDATE: The Franklin County Board of Commissioners and the City of Apalachicola have declared a local state of emergency, following an emergency meeting to mobilize resources quickly and efficiently. Beginning Sunday, June 15, ice and water trucks will distribute resources under the bridge in the Commercial District and at 192 Coach Wagoner Blvd. from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. FRANKLIN COUNTY, Fla. ( WMBB ) – Residents say their water is discolored and has a strong odor. They believe it is making them sick and giving them rashes. They say there was a lack of communication from city officials. However, residents got some answers at Thursday’s meeting. Apalachicola has dealt with water quality issues for years. The issue worsened after Hurricane Helene hit in September 2024. Helicopter crash on Destin Executive Airport runway, investigation underway The high winds knocked off the aerator from their water tower, which is what removes pollutants, gases, and odors from their water. Residents say their water has been discolored and smelly ever since. “Since we’ve had this water problem. He has rashes all the time. He has problems with his eyes, especially since the water now is brown at my house,” an Apalachicola resident said. In March, city officials made an emergency expenditure to have the piece of equipment constructed for around $500,000. While they are waiting for that work to be completed, they may have found a temporary solution. The city of Carrabelle has an extra aerator that might match what they need and could be installed by the end of July. “When the water comes out of the well, it goes into the tank and it’s within that tank where the mixer is in the bottom. And then you have the scrubber at the top that gets that air rights and gets rid of all of the gases that come out,” Apalachicola City Commissioner Donna Duncan said. Apalachicola has three water wells that pump into the ground storage tank. One well is currently down for maintenance. Water management teams dug to the bottom of the well this week to clean and flush it. On Monday, they will test the water quality and put the well back online. They say another well has air issues, which leaves one well. Management teams plan to install a fourth well system for $1,000,000, but they still need to find land that would include an additional cost. “That million-dollar-plus investment will be felt throughout generations, and we will have that backup system if a whale goes down, if there’s an issue our wells,” Apalachicola Mayor Brenda Ash said. Florida Rural Water says Apalachicola is still receiving primary water, and it is still drinkable. “While it smells and while it looks horrible, we’re being told that it’s still safe. And I understand the frustration and being told that because if it smells horrible and it looks horrible and people are having reactions if there’s rashes based on the extra chlorine and different things like that,” Duncan said. Many residents choose to buy bottled water. “We’re bathing in with bottled water, my four-year-old, the baby, like refuse, is we can’t even use like our outside water, like toys or anything. It’s not just physical health. It’s emotionally it’s like mental health crisis,” Apalachicola resident Krystal Hernandez said. In the meantime, the city issued a boil water notice for residents. “Our systems have been working overtime and building up and building up and they may not be working to the level that they should have been. My husband could lose his leg. He could lose his life,” an Apalachicola resident said. 3-year illegal drivers license scheme unveils public corruption in Bay County Franklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith reached out to Senator Corey Simon for water supplies. The sheriff’s office will be distributing 1,800 cases of water at Apalachicola High School at 9 a.m. on Friday. City officials hope to receive funding from the Apalachicola Stewardship Act on July 1st. It would allow them to directly address water quality concerns. They are in the process of reaching out to Governor Ron DeSantis to request that he issue a state of emergency in Apalachicola. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
