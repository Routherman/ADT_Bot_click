This is part of downtown Fort Myers’ historic River District , where inventors and industry pioneers Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone once worked and played. In fact, festival goers can enjoy D.J. Wilkins’ sculpture and fountain dedicated to these three Uncommon Friends at the entrance to Centennial Park. Also on display within the festival grounds are Fort Myers’ historically-significant sculpture, Clayton , a monument dedicated to the 2nd Regiment of the USCT (United States Colored Troops), who defended Fort Myers from a Confederate attack on February 20, 1865; the Buckingham & Paige Army Air Field Monument;  the Florida Panthers in the median on Monroe Street; Columbian artist Edgardo Carmona’s Cor-Ten steel sculpture Nostalgic Tune on the Radio; and more than 40 murals on the concrete stanchions that surround the river basin which tell the story of Fort Myers historic relationship to the Caloosahatchee River. Festivalgoers can learn about the artists who created each sculpture and mural, as well as the stories they tell, by downloading a free phone app called Otocast, which contains text, historic photos and an audio about the artwork. The festival takes place in the shadow of the 12-story 243-room Luminary Hotel, which is part of the prestigious Autograph Collection of Marriott International. Inside, guests and visitors will find five featured food and beverage outlets – Ella Mae’s Diner, Dean Street Coffee, the Lobby Bar, and the hotel’s signature Silver King Ocean Brasserie and Beacon Social Drinkery rooftop lounge. Festival goers will also notice that the former Harborside Event Center has been completely renovated and renamed. It now goes by the moniker of Caloosa Sound Convention Center & Amphitheater. Not only is the Luminary mere blocks from the art galleries, trendy boutiques, retail shops and savory restaurants that populate Fort Myers’ historic, but completely refurbished , downtown, it overlooks a 1.8 acre basin that does more than provide a unifying, visual hub for the hotel, convention center and surrounding retail shops, galleries and restaurants. The basin actually serves the utilitarian function of filtering and cleaning the stormwater that runs off from the surrounding 15-acre hardscape before it joins the waters of the Caloosahatchee River and downriver estuaries. Awards and Recognition. ArtFest Fort Myers was chosen in October of 2013 as the “Best OVERALL REGIONAL Art Fair” in Southwest Florida in a survey conducted by ArtFairCalendar.com , the #1 website for art fair event listings. Whereas Sunshine Artist Magazine and Art Fair Insider rank festivals based on voting by “art fair insiders” such as artists and show staff, the America’s Best Art Fairs Awards are predicated on online voting by artists, organizers and art fair patrons and collectors, both regionally and nationally. As such, it is the first national online survey of the nation’s art fairs designed to reward those festivals that excel at creating opportunities that bring together artists and communities to celebrate the arts. “ArtFest Fort Myers has always been popular among art fair lovers in Southwest Florida, but our new national Best Art Fairs Awards survey proves that both art collectors and artists nationwide love it, too,” said ArtFairCalendar.com Publisher Connie Mettler in announcing the award. “We’re happy to give a “Best OVERALL/REGIONAL Art Fair Award to ArtFest Fort Myers today.” Please scroll down for articles on the numerous additional awards that ArtFest has garnered in recent years. VIP Opening Night Party. The opening night of ArtFest is more than just a tantalizing preview. It’s time Symphony on the Sounds and the ArtFest VIP Opening Night Party inside ArtFest’s glowing VIP garden tent, where the conversation is lively, the laughter raucous, and delectable treats, great wines and spirits are provided by some of the area’s finest restaurants. “When we open on Friday night, we are really proud of the fact that the Gulf Coast Symphony performs a free Pops Concert,” said Festival Director Sharon McAllister. This is the third year that Gulf Coast Symphony has opened ArtFest Fort Myers. Symphony founder and Music Director Andrew Kurtz explains why this year is special. “The Gulf Coast Symphony is doing a Broadway concert as part of the opening night festivities of the 25 th anniversary of ArtFest, which also coincides with our 30 th anniversary.” Limited seating will be provided. Personal chairs and blankets are allowed. The VIP experience doesn’t end when the concert and party are over. The VIP pass is good for all three days, and comes with reserved parking, access to the VIP Terrace overlooking the festival grounds, and complimentary lunch, all-day beverages and refreshments on Saturday and Sunday, and the gift of a commemorative festival poster. The VIP Experience is $135 per person and your support contributes to the year-round ArtFest Fort Myers’ art education outreach programs. To enjoy the ArtFest Fort Myers VIP Experience and the 200 artists as a Very Important Patron visit Upgrade To VIP at ArtFestFortMyers.com or call 239-768-3602. The Festival. More than 90,000 people attend ArtFest over the course of its three-day run. Both the serious art lover and novice collector will find ArtFest Fort Myers the perfect place to learn about the world of art and add to or begin a unique collection as 211 artists from 39 different states display paintings in oil and acrylic, watercolors, drawings in pastels, charcoal, pen and ink and graphite, 2D and 3D mixed media works and collages, photography and digital artworks, bronze and metal sculpture, wood working, ceramics, pottery, glass fusion and glass art, hand-crafted art jewelry, leather works and more. These are the best of the best, as nearly 1,200 artists apply each year for inclusion in this juried show, and many of these artists are seldom seen in Southwest Florida – their art is fresh and new. The organizers have laid out the artists’ booth in such a way as to create a circular flow of foot traffic down a wide central mall that engenders a beautiful, stress-free, open-air art gallery overflowing with exceptional artwork. Continuous music and the aromatic smells of succulent foods add to the festival experience. ArtFest Fort Myers strives to create a balanced show that fairly represents diverse styles, methodologies and techniques in the various categories just mentioned. In order to achieve this result, artists are selected based upon quality of workmanship, originality and artistic conception, and all work is required to be created soley by the displaying artists. Cost: ArtFest is free. Parking: The City of Fort Myers is well equipped to handle the large crowds attracted to ArtFest with a mixture of free and pay parking lots. You can expect to pay $4 to park in one of three city parking garages; $5 to park in various general and church lots; and $10 to park in the parking lot adjoining the Harborside Event Center which is closest to the festival grounds. However, a medley of free lots and parking garages are within easy walking distance (4-6 blocks) including the Lee County Justice Center Parking Garage which is the home of Parallel Park , a 30,000 square foot public art installation that looks so stunning people often confuse it for a fine art museum. Organizer: The festival is organized by ArtFest Fort Myers, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The organization’s mission is the creation of public access to a broad array of visual art; nurturing the development and understanding of diverse art forms; supporting arts in education and encouraging the appreciation of the arts in Southwest Florida. Its staff actively attends meetings of the Greater Fort Myers Chamber, the Southwest Florida Attractions Association, the Tourist Development Council, and the Fort Myers City Council to provide support and input in its areas of expertise. Festival Director: With business degrees from the University of Hawaii and the University of Chicago, ArtFest Executive Director Sharon McAllister became a part of the Lee County community upon her early retirement at the age of 39. Her experience as a Divisional Vice President with H&R Block quickly transitioned into active local community service. In 2000, Sharon took over the existing “Lee Sidewalk Arts & Crafts Show” at the request of City of Fort Myers Downtown Redevelopment Director Don Paight, who asked her to form a not-for-profit organization and transform this annual event into ArtFest Fort Myers, a juried fine art festival. Under her tutelage, this event has quickly gained national recognition, while bringing an unparalleled art experience to the community. Among her credits are Past Chair of the City of Fort Myers Public Art Committee; Past President of the Fort Myers Conference & Convention Council; and 3 years as the Vice Chair of the Florida Festival and Events Association (FFEA). Website: http://www.artfestfortmyers.com . Fast Facts : ArtFest uses a “blind jury”. This means the jurors do not know the names or any other information about the artists. There are five jury members. Each is an experienced art professional who is selected for his/her art background and appreciation of festival artists. The five member panel is convened in the same room, and each juror is given access to a computer monitor for scoring purposes. Artist images are projected digitally (image size is 3 feet by 3 feet), shown simultaneously and scored on a seven point scale. ArtFest Fort Myers maintains an online gallery, which it updates in October, of the artists accepted for the upcoming festival! There are links to the artists’ websites, which you visit to find more information or view additional artwork. ArtFest Fort Myers and Florida SouthWestern State College work together to provide an art experience through after-school programs for elementary students. This collaborative project brings art alive for hundreds of students and develops innovative teachers for the future. ArtFest also sponsors “Art Under 20,” an art competition and exhibition open to Lee County high school students. The program not only provides them a huge platform in which to showcase their talents, but $6,000 in cash prizes for the very best student artists. Kids@Art, a collaborative effort of ArtFest Fort Myers and The Lee County Alliance For The Arts , helps eager “weekend artists” of all ages to tap into their best creative selves. ArtFest provides the supplies and supervision to all who wish to make an artistic treasure to take home. ArtFest also provides a “kids only” shopping zone called “The Young Art Collectors Gallery.” Filled with wonderful items donated by festival artists, the gallery is the perfect place for children ages 6 to 12 to purchase artwork for only $5. The “kids only” shopping zone is a brilliant concept that fosters the development of future art patrons with an emphasis on fun. During the festival, Florida Repertory Theatre, Southwest Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra, and Celtic Arts dancers will be showcasing their talent in a series of free performances taking place on the Youth Stage. If you’ve been wondering if your youngster has a calling to be a violin virtuoso or a trumpet player in the marching band, the Southwest Florida Symphony will be on hand with their Petting Zoo, where getting bit by the music bug is your only worry. A variety of musical instruments will be available for all to play, with expert instruction on hand, courtesy of the Youth Symphony members. The ArtFest staff actively attends meetings of the Visitor & Convention Bureau, the Fort Myers City Council, the Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce, the Southwest Florida Attractions Association and the Tourist Development Council to provide support and input in its areas of expertise. As one of the community’s most popular and respected arts organizations, ArtFest believes it has a responsibility to be involved in the success of art and culture throughout the area. “We are members or attendees and supporters of all the arts organizations in Lee County.” _____________________________________________________ ARTICLES AND LINKS.

Meet the Artists in person As a juried art festival, we are choosy about the artists who come to ArtFest Fort Myers. Only 1 in 5 artists who apply are invited to exhibit here, and they hail from dozens of states across the U.S. ArtFest is an artist’s and art lover’s destination — right here in Fort Myers. Visit the Online Art Gallery and browse some quality work at this year’s ArtFest. And make plans to chat with our artists, up close and in person, as you discover beautiful, handcrafted pieces in every booth. Add to a favorite collection, or begin with your first art purchase. You’ll find a treasure to call your own, regardless of your age and budget. What does it mean to be a Juried Art Festival? Artists apply by submitting digital images of their artwork and booth display. A five-member panel of art professionals reviews and scores all entries. ArtFest staff members are not involved in the selection process — it is done exclusively by the panel. The artists whose entries score highest in each category are invited to exhibit at ArtFest Fort Myers. Artists are selected based on the quality of workmanship, originality, and artistic conception, to create a balanced and diverse show. All work must be created solely by the exhibiting artists. Juried art festivals work hard to maintain each event's quality and professional integrity. Exhibitors considered \"importers\" and \"production houses\" are not allowed to exhibit Explore ArtFest Artists Enjoy the work of hundreds of ArtFest artists from the past decade-plus, starting with the 2012 festival!

In our view it is all about quality of life in our community”. Publix Run to the Arts isn’t just a race, it’s a full morning of fun that kicks off Sunday morning at ArtFest Fort Myers with exceptional art, entertainment, and children’s art activities.

Artists are selected based upon quality of workmanship, originality and artistic conception. All work must be done solely by the displaying artists. ArtFest Fort Myers takes seriously its responsibility to exclude work not done by the artist - such as production house work or buy-sell work. ArtFest Fort Myers uses a monitor jury either as an in-town group or remotely. The jury is a \"blind jury.\" This means the jurors do not know the names or any other information about the artists. ArtFest Fort Myers uses Zapplication to administer its application and jury process. Artist images can be viewed simultaneously or individually, in the order the artist uploads them to ZAPP. The booth image is always on the right (last in the series). Artist images are scored on a seven-point scale. Jurors can't use the 4 forcing them to \"get off the average fence\". The jurors, a diverse group of 5 experienced art professionals, are selected for their art background and for their appreciation of the value of art festivals. Our jury members vary each year and a festival artist is often included on this panel. Ninety percent (90%) of the artist spaces will be selected through the jury process. The Best of Show Artists and 2025 Poster Artists have automatic acceptance to ArtFest Fort Myers 2026. The art festival also has the ability to invite artists of our choice. We expect, based on history, approximately 180 artists will be selected in the Jury Process with the remaining 20+/- being award winners, poster artists or invitees. A waitlist, by category based on jury scores, will be established for each art medium of the festival. Images from accepted artists will be utilized for promotion and adherence to the rules. The decision of the jury is final. Examples of Accepted Art For more examples, see the online gallery. (All accepted artists are featured there.) TIPS FOR GREAT SUBMISSIONS Please check out the Artists Tips for some helpful tips on creating a good artwork submission. We also encourage artists to take advantage of Mock Jury online or in-person to create the strongest applications to any art festival. Your artwork images should fill the 1920 x 1920 space available and be cropped well to showcase your artwork. Backgrounds for 3D artwork should enhance not distract from your artwork. Booth image should show your booth as it is set up for an outdoor or indoor show with your work displayed, but must not reveal the artist name or have people standing in the booth . The Image Description and Artist Statement will be available to the jurors on their computer monitor and we ask that they read each one. Please use the Artist Statement to convey the process used to create your work and not the inspiration behind your artwork as that should speak for itself. Use your words well , get the message into one sentence that can be read quickly, it is so important for your jury score . Return to top Category Descriptions Work from production houses, co-ops, imported for resale, designed by the artist but not created by the artist and any other work not done by the artist will not be allowed.

We’re here to champion the next generation of art show artists — providing them with the skills, support, and real-world experience they need to launch thriving careers.

In the second year, this next generation of artists will have the opportunity to show their work: Highlights of this year include: Shared space inside our Emerging Artist Tent Personal financial planning Personal application consultation. Requirements: Resides in Lee County. If not a local resident, must be willing to travel to Fort Myers and provide their own housing during the festival. Has not participated in a major juried art festival. Must be 18 or older to participate in this program. College or University is not required. Return to top Reproduction Policy To foster an appreciation and value of the arts in all people, including those who cannot afford original work, offering attendees the opportunity to buy reproductions is essential. As their incomes grow, they will turn to original work. This transition is possible only if buyers understand precisely what they are buying and the process behind it. Therefore, ArtFest Fort Myers' guidelines are as follows: All reproductions must be clearly and individually labeled as such. Labels must say \"Reproduction.\"  This will include any framed reproductions. Reproductions must be in signed and numbered editions. No hand-colored reproductions or enhanced reproductions will be considered \"original\" works; they will be regarded as reproductions Reproductions must be an ancillary part of the artist's display. Violators of the spirit and the letter of this policy will be asked to remove their unlabeled reproductions. In any dispute, the decision of the Executive Director shall prevail. Return to top Eligibility and Rules All work must be done solely by the displaying artists. ArtFest Fort Myers takes seriously its responsibility to exclude work not done by the artist - such as production house work or buy-sell work. Acceptance into ArtFest Fort Myers is non-transferable. Only artwork of the accepted artist may be displayed. Artwork must be original in design, and an artist may display and sell only in the media category in which his work has been accepted. Work displayed and sold at ArtFest Fort Myers must be consistent with work represented by jury images. Artists are prohibited from displaying or selling non-original promotional items (i.e., posters, postcards, note cards, calendars, t-shirts, etc.) at the festival. Commercial agents, dealers, manufacturers, or buy-sell vendors are not eligible to enter, nor can they be proxies for artists. Artwork produced with kits, castings from commercial molds, patterns, plans, or other commercial means is prohibited. No work by apprentices or employees will be accepted. Work from production houses, co-ops, imported for resale, designed by the artist but not created by the artist and any other work not done by the artist will not be allowed. The use of AI in the creation of artwork must be disclosed in artist's application. Tent Rental: Artist desiring to rent a tent and/or booth setup may do so only through Tents4Events - they supply artist-style tents and equipment. No other tent rental companies are allowed. Artist must notify ArtFest Fort Myers that they are using a rental tent through Tents4Events . Collaborators: If two or more persons collaborate to produce original work, each person must be identified on the application. Collaborations are to be true artistic collaboration rather than business collaboration. For example, framing or printing work does not constitute a creative partnership. Therefore, individuals involved in those processes should not be listed on the application as a partner or collaborator. Sales Tax: Artists are responsible for collecting and paying 6.5% of Florida sales tax. Lee County is the collection area. Liability insurance: Artists are responsible for procuring and maintaining their liability insurance and must provide ArtFest Fort Myers with a Certificate of Insurance must name ArtFest For Myers as Additional Insured (wording shown below) by the deadline and stated above under the heading \"Deadlines and Fees.\" Withdrawal: Artists may withdraw from ArtFest Fort Myers and receive a refund of their Booth Fee (less $85) if a written request is received on or before the deadline specified above under the heading \"Deadlines and Fees.\" No refunds will be issued after that date. ArtFest Fort Myers is a rain-or-shine festival. No refunds will be issued for weather, pandemics or other acts of God. On-site at ArtFest Fort Myers : Artists and all collaborating partners must be present on-site with their booths for business during the festival. If two names are on the application, both must check in, show photo ID, and be present for the festival. Artists must confine their setup to the space allocated by ArtFest Fort Myers and not infringe on neighboring artists' space or pedestrian/vehicle passage space. Space allocations are based on Fire Marshall rules, and no infringements will be tolerated. This has always been our policy, but it is now necessary to add it to the written rules for enforcement. Original art must occupy at least 50% of the artist's wall space. All artwork on walls must be framed or otherwise professionally hung. Browse bins may occupy only minimal space and must be aesthetically pleasing and not obstruct patron flow. All artwork displayed must be for sale. Limited edition, signed, and numbered reproductions of artwork are allowed. Artists must define \"limited edition\" in their Artist Information Statement and disclose their reproduction process to buyers. Artists must display an Artist Information Statement in a prominent place within their booth. Materials and processes used must be disclosed in this statement. Displaying ribbons and awards from previous shows or other shows is not allowed. Artists must comply with all safety requirements, including weighted tents, and vehicles must be parked only in designated areas. No artist-owned animals are allowed in or around Artists' booths. Artists sitting in a chair outside their booth in attendee walking areas must use High Chairs Only! Having a lower-type chair in the way of attendee traffic is a tripping hazard and safety concern. This has always been our policy, but it is now necessary to add it to the written rules for enforcement. Artists must park in designated Artist Parking only - it is nearby and has trolley service to and from the lot. Artists cannot park their vans, trailers, RV, or similar within two blocks of the entrance areas or perimeter of the festival site at any time over the festival weekend or during setup and breakdown preparation. This is a Homeland Security issue for the perimeter of an outdoor event as large as ArtFest Fort Myers. The Festival perimeter area will be monitored for artist vans, trucks, etc., close to the festival site. If an artist's vehicle is found within the festival's defined perimeter, they will be notified to move their vehicle, or the vehicle will be towed. Return to top Welcome, Artists!
