EMPLOYMENT CONTACT US THE SUITER FAMILY Bill Sr. and Phyllis with their sons, Bill Jr. and Dave Antonio’s Pizza not only has a great recipe for spectacular pizza, but also for business success! We are a family-owned business that builds personal relationships with our customers and our vendors. Founded in 1992, our owner Bill Suiter, Sr. opened the first Antonio’s Pizza locations in Virden, Illinois and the Old State Capitol Plaza in Springfield.  The recipes we use culminated from original ideas developed by Bill, Sr. and his friends who were “old school local Italian food veterans.”  While Bill, Sr.’s career in the food business spans over 50 years, sons Bill, Jr. and Dave Suiter now manage the day-to-day operations.  Our father and sons team has expanded to five locations throughout Springfield.  Antonio’s success comes from creating flavorful and unique products for our customers because we insist on using quality ingredients throughout an extensive menu.  Providing friendly customer service has also secured our spot as one of Springfield’s most popular pizza places. SIGNATURE PIZZAS Antonio’s pizza menu offers a full selection of unique flavors and tasty combinations that cater to almost anyone's preferences. Our special-recipe pizza dough is made fresh daily (never frozen!) in one location so we can ensure a quality, consistent crust for every pizza we create.  The dough is proofed in-store to ensure maximum flavor and texture on both our original crust and the thick crust pizza.  And we don’t skimp on the toppings!  We use a generous amount of only the freshest meat and veggies.  We also offer a special Bianco sauce as a marinara substitute, which is the perfect blend of olive oil, garlic, basil, oregano, and Romano cheese. COMMUNITY VALUES As a local Springfield business, we take pride in our community’s economy and well-being.  We buy the freshest meat from a local meat processor and purchase fresh produce from a local vegetable market.  This helps us guarantee that we use only the freshest, highest quality ingredients throughout our menu.  Also, we support local schools and community groups with fundraising activities and understand the importance of giving back to our community. Antonio’s Pizza believes in investing in our community and the future of our youth. We are proud to offer our support to the following organizations: National High School Finals Rodeo (Major Sponsor) Local Minor League Baseball (Major Sponsor) Local Junior Hockey (Major Sponsor) Local Schools/Churches Crimestoppers Salvation Army Local Law Enforcement Youth Sports Springfield Recreation Department Roman Cultural Society Big Brothers/Big Sisters ANTONIO'S GIFT CERTIFICATES/CARDS Want to give Antonio’s as a gift?

Italian born and raised Giorgia Caporuscio is a master pizzaiola and owner of Don Antonio in New York City. The youngest woman to win the “Classic” category at the Caputo Cup (basically, the Olympics of pizza held annually in Naples) is also a soon-to-be mother of a second child and the daughter of legendary pizzaiolo Roberto Caporuscio of Kesté Pizza e Vino in lower Manhattan. Late last month, at the 50 Top Pizza USA award ceremony in New York, Giorgia was named “Pizza Maker of the Year” while Don Antonio was recognized as the 7 th best pizzeria in America. With all the recent accolades, I thought to pay Giorgia a visit at Don Antonio to talk about the recent acclaim and to have myself a pizza. You had quite a night at this year's 50 Top Pizza USA ceremony. Congratulations! Thank you! I was super surprised as I never expected to be the “Pizza Maker of the Year.” This award was such an honor for me, and it felt like such an accomplishment after 14 years as a pizza maker here in America. You also happen to be the first woman to receive this award, yes? Yes. I think so. Giorgia Caporuscio, with Gaspare Magnifico Fracaro from Ferrarelle mineral water, accepting her prize as 2024's \"Pizza Maker of the Year.\" And Don Antonio, which you fully acquired from your father earlier this year, came in at #7 in the 50 Top Pizza competition. What makes Don Antonio so special? It starts with hard work. I am here every day with my husband, Matteo, and we have a team that focuses on consistency with regard to food preparation, service, and atmosphere. Of course, we also focus on the highest quality of ingredients. We are always trying to give something new to the customers. Matteo has created a seasonal cocktail list to pair with our pizzas. Our entire menu, which is almost 40 varieties, can also be made gluten-free. When I took over Don Antonio, my idea was to create something that was more a reflection of me. When I was young, I didn't go often to restaurants because going to restaurants for us was only for something to celebrate. It always felt so special to go to restaurants, to eat good food, to feel comfortable, and I wanted to recreate that kind of feeling for my costumers so that they feel at home but also special at the same time. Is this what you had in mind when you arrived here from Italy at 19 years old? No! When I first arrived here, I had just finished high school. I had zero idea of what I wanted to do. I didn't want to go to college. All of my best friends in Italy moved to London because they could go with no visa at that point, and money wise, it was easy for them to work in the restaurant business. For me, though, my father had just opened the original Kesté on Bleecker Street in New York City. My mom suggested I go check it out. Maybe I'd learn something new. The biggest challenge for me is that I didn't know many people, and I was underage, so I couldn't go out to bars and socialize. The only way for me to be with Italian people was to stay at the restaurant with my father and his coworkers. Every day, I went there just to have fun, and everyone was making fun of me because I didn’t know how to make pasta; I didn’t know how to make pizza. So, I decided to show them that I could, to prove them wrong, and this is how I discovered my passion. This is when I realized that pizza making was in my blood. The entrance to Don Antonio at 309 W. 50th Street in New York City. Do women make pizza differently than men? I think so. For women, it is easier because we don't have a lot of power in our hands. We have a soft touch, and we can control more the power that we have in our hands. We can push the dough in a way that is more effective. Neapolitan pizza has a soft dough, and men often smash the dough while women do not.  Pizza making is an art, and women have a mentality that is more elastic. Do you see yourself as a role model for women who want to be in the pizza business? Most pizza makers are still men, of course, but this is changing. I am one of the original members of Women in Pizza , a movement that promotes gender equality and professional growth for women in the pizza industry. There are many of us who have been doing this job for years. We have strong personalities. We have a strong work ethic. We have strong backgrounds in pizza. We are owners and founders of our businesses. We come from different parts of the country, and I am proud to be a part of this movement. I dream of the younger generation of women seeing me and saying, \"She can do it. So can I.\" La Montanara (fried pizza) at Don Antonio. What is the signature pizza at Don Antonio? I think our fried pizza, la Montanara, is our signature because it is a classic pizza, one of the oldest you can find in Naples. This is what I made when I won the competition at the Caputo Cup. I also think there is something that sparkles with this pizza as you have the light crunch from the fry but still the soft in the inside. Can I order one? Yes, of course!

Restaurants Antonio’s Pizza and Italian Restaurant Looks to Be Opening New Dania Beach Location Paperwork Shows Antonio’s Pizzeria and Italian Restaurant opening on North Federal Highway Published Date: April 24, 2024, 9:04 AM EDT Written By Neil Cooney News Writer Share SHARE The retail and restaurant community located on North Federal Highway between Northeast Second and Third Streets in Dania Beach appears to be welcoming a new Antonio’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant location in the mix. Plan review paperwork submitted by Antonio’s Pizzeria and Italian Restaurant LLC shows an opening at 222 North Federal Highway . With locations at 3088 Griffin Road in Fort Lauderdale, and 4551 Hollywood Blvd. in Hollywood , the new Dania spot would appear to be a third outpost for the longtime South Florida brand. “A family style atmosphere passed down from generation to generation, welcome to Antonio’s,” says the brand’s website. “Since 1978, we have been serving our community the finest Italian food in South Florida!” The brand serves a selection of “hand-crafted pizzas, garlic rolls, soups, salads, and pastas,” including favorite dishes like Veal Chop Marsala, Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Francese, and Grilled Salmon. What Now reached out on Tuesday to co-owner Stephen Suriani to inquire about plans for a new Dania Beach restaurant. Suriani was not immediately available for comment. Opening in the North Federal Highway location—a building that also houses AYR Cannabis Dispensary —Antonio’s would also be joining craft brewery 3 Sons Brewing .
