Rebuild Lagos Trust Fund Ltd/GTE is a not-for-profit public-private partnership (PPP) organisation birthed in the aftermath of the October 2020 civil unrest in Lagos, Nigeria. The fund was established by the Executive Order, NO EO/BOS/2020 for rebuilding and restoring affected state assets and landmark structures in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. Rebuild Lagos Trust Fund was eventually incorporated as a company limited by guarantee on Monday, 26 April 2021 to enhance efficiency in the discharge of its mandate. “ A catalyst that helps rebuild Lagos for tomorrow” Our goal is simple: to reinstate and improve Lagos State’s public assets and structures that were affected by the unrest. As an organisation limited by guarantee, we collaborate with a wide range of public, donor, and private sector partners including international organisations to achieve our mandate. Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State Speech Let me assure you all that we will bounce back. We do not have a choice, really.

By reason of our love for Lagos, we the members of the committee are fully committed to the restoration, rehabilitation, and rebuilding of this great state; that is why we have agreed to serve on the Rebuild Trust Fund for Lagos” Read More PD/CEO’s message I am honored to address you and it is with great pride that I write this message to you today. Our organization is committed to rebuilding and revitalizing Lagos, our beloved city that has faced unprecedented challenges in recent times. Read More Our Work RLTF has identified causes of the deficit amidst the citizenry and the government, and we are bridging the gap in the affected communities. We review and manage the post-civil unrest needs assessment, rapid response, technical assistance, capacity building and are developing a sustainable recovery framework for Lagos state. We proactively engage all relevant stakeholders and offer feedback to the government on areas where the infrastructure and trust deficits require prompt interventions. RLTF is saddled with the responsibility of receiving and managing funds comprising donations, gifts, grants and endowments that may be mobilized for the purpose of rebuilding, reconstructing, repairing and managing public infrastructure and assets destroyed or damaged as a result of the civil disorder in Lagos state in October, 2020.

By reason of our love for Lagos, we the members of the committee are fully committed to the restoration, rehabilitation, and rebuilding of this great state; that is why we have agreed to serve on the Rebuild Trust Fund for Lagos” The Lagos State government has a tremendous track record with respect to private sector engagement. We are all witnesses to the phenomenal role that the annual economic summit, Ehingbeti, has played in the economic development of the state over the years. I would like to specially commend Mr. Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for his leadership in getting the private sector involved with this initiative and taking private sector engagement in governance to yet another level. The Rebuild Lagos Trust Fund Committee consists of 10 people, 8 of whom are from the private sector. The composition of the committee speaks volumes about its independence and the way and manner it is expected to function. In preparing ourselves for the job at hand, we believe it is important for us to understand why this rampaging violence descended on us so rapidly and to such devastating effect. While the destruction unleashed cannot be excused, the reasons for it must be understood if we are to avoid a recurrence. Without an understanding of the foundations of wanton destruction, our rebuilding efforts will be in vain. While the Trust Fund has a critical role to play, there will continue to be lingering doubts about its efficacy if causation is not addressed from the outset. It is not part of our remit to address these socio-economic issues, but we are convinced that unless those interrogations are honestly engaged in, the credibility and efficacy of our efforts will be called into doubt. We extend our deepest sympathy to the families of those who lost lives and property during the recent unrest and hope that all Lagosians will focus on developing a shared understanding and a common vision to activate the Lagos of our dreams. Finally, I cannot conclude this address without leaving you with one critical thought, and that is that ‘This is not a time for cynicism. This is a time to roll up our sleeves and come together to get on with the job at hand’. No one should be saying that “it can’t be done”; rather we should all be saying “who can stop us.” THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!"

Opus Dei Opus Dei translates to “Work of God”. It is an institution of the Catholic Church founded by St. Josemaría Escrivá on 2 October 1928. Its task is to spread the Christian message that everybody is called to holiness and that daily work and ordinary life are the normal way to achieve this. Opus Dei stands as a pillar of the Christian identity and can be traced through the history of the church back to the early Christians. They were ordinary people who tried their best to consistently live their Christian commitments in the midst of their ordinary occupations, taking the Gospel message to all environments. This is what is meant by seeking sanctity in the mundane activities of the world, that is, trying to be like Jesus Christ, converting daily life into an occasion to love God and others for his sake.
