      "text": "FUEL BBQ is Hot, Hot, Hot! - Sanford 365 Home About Calendar Blog The Latest Events Food For Kids Arts Businesses Real Estate Guides Subscribe Videos Find a Home Submit Event Advertise Contact Select Page FUEL BBQ is Hot, Hot, Hot! May 12, 2016 | 2 Fuel BBQ (120 S Park Avenue, Sanford, FL – 407-328-4848) surprised most of us by announcing that they were opening the doors the weekend of the St. Johns Art Festival. And since then we’ve heard nothing, but delicious things about them. Although they still have some things here and there to work on before they have their official Grand Opening, I was able to get a sneak peek just before they opened their doors as well as a little Q & A from owners Chris & Michelle (also the owners of The Alley Blues). We are so, so very excited for everyone at Fuel, join in on the excitement and read below to see what is currently happening and what’s to come for Fuel BBQ!! What can we expect to see on Fuel’s menu? Here is our regular menu Meats: Beef Brisket Pulled Pork Pulled Chicken Smoked Chicken Salad St. Louis Style Ribs 1/2 Chicken Sides: BBQ Beans French Fries Cole Slaw Collard Greens Fried Okra Green Beans Sweet Potato Fries Smoked Mac N Cheese Side Salad Dinner Salad Desserts: Banana Pudding This is the menu we will start with but we certainly plan to add specials and such as we go! Why did you choose Sanford as the home for Fuel? We’ve owned The Alley blues venue at 114 S. Park Ave for nearly seven years now– BBQ is a great accompaniment to our live music offerings. Also, since no one is doing BBQ in downtown Sanford, it was a natural fit for us. Does Fuel BBQ have a background story? In addition to the passion Chris has for the live music side of our business- you can catch him playing keyboard or guitar in our jams from time to time- BBQ has been another of his pursuits since the late eighties. While attending Stetson University, he managed the kitchen at a popular, Orlando-based BBQ chain to help pay for college. Having been in high tech sales ever since, it has been a dream of his to re-live those days by providing patrons with a BBQ experience like none other. While we’re not out to be the biggest, we do expect to be the best– from the long, low- temperature smoking process we employ to the care taken in preparing each of our delicious sides, we’re striving for quality in every meal we serve. It takes dedication but the results are truly worth it. Can we expect other things than food? Music, drinks? The Alley is just a step over (literally folks) from Fuel BBQ and will be housing all the events. In addition to a full non-smoking bar, The Alley offers live music 6 nights a week– including local and national acts on Fridays and Saturdays, three of Central Florida’s longest running and best attended jams on Wednesdays at 7 PM, Thursdays at 8 PM and Sunday’s at 5 PM and our latest additions, Acoustic Tuesday’s with Iesha and Friends at 8 PM and First Sundays with Tom and Mark Open Mic at 1 PM. Our full entertainment calendar is available on our website www.thealleyblues.com and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/TheAlleyBlues The outdoor area with the picnic tables looks amazing! Any other cool things we should be on the lookout for? The posts around the patio will soon support market lights with exposed bulbs– we’re really excited about the additional ambiance the lights will add to our outdoor dining experience. Additional tables (think bistro style two-tops) are also planned as are umbrellas to provide patrons with some shade. The big question we are all looking for, when can we expect to see Fuel’s doors open? Will there be a grand opening “party”? We had a soft opened on Thursday April 28th. While we haven’t pinned down our exact hours just yet, we’re open for lunch and dinner starting at 11:00 AM Tuesday through Sunday (closed Monday). A grand opening celebration will be planned in the near future (no date yet– we’ll keep you informed). To stay in the loop with all of Fuel BBQ’s upcoming events and the Grand Opening, please follow them on Facebook or better yet stop by yourself and welcome them to the neighborhood! We’ve heard spectacular things already!! Claudia’s sister is in town from Germany and guess where they decided to go for lunch? That’s right, Fuel BBQ! Claudia says the food was scrumptious, the staff was nice and the laid back atmosphere made it enjoyable for everyone, including the kiddos! Check out the pictures below to see their delicious meal (BEWARE DROOLING MAY OCCUR) and peek at the bar side, The Alley!

It is real BarBQue. Not just roasted meat that one covers with sauce. The greens are excellent but they seem to skimp on the serving.  My sons loves the smokey macaroni and cheese.  My favorite is the brisket.  I wish they had more and a cooler seating area.  I’m happy it’s here Log in to Reply Claudia on March 31, 2021 at 5:30 pm So happy you and your son enjoy Fuel BBQ. Small businesses are usually very receptive to customer feedback if there is anything that you think would help improve their business be sure to kindly reach out to them privately and let them know and don’t forget to mention how much you love their food.

Anonymous Competition Cherry BBQ Sauce  - American Royal Best on the Planet 09/02/2025 Amazing Ribs Awesome ribs for low and slow cooking. Best I've tried. Jayden USDA St Louis Ribs – Swift Brand 08/27/2025 Good sized Dutch oven Bought a Monolith Kamado BBQ and wanted the heavy iron pot to go with it. I've only used it for reheating some pulled pork and cooking sausages on the griddle lid, but I'm going to use it for goulash and stews come the autumn.  It's a well made bit of kit, which should last years.

Sure, Brooklyn can lay claim to the mobile BBQ Smokercycle, but it couldn’t hold an energy-efficient candle to a certain barbecue joint in the Bokey that goes by the very unhipster name of “Fuel.” Owners Chris and Michelle Johnson annexed the space next to their popular blues bar, the Alley, to house this comfy little pit stop because, after all, there’s no more natural a pairing with blues than barbecue (though vision loss comes a close second). But even Blind Lemon Jefferson would have to give some Texas props to the mad char being fired up by pitmaster Clay Watson, who moonlights as trombonist for blues-rock outfit the Legendary JC’s. Just ogling the flesh on the steam table brought out our hoggish nature, but little did we know that the act of rattling off the meats we desired would darn near blow our cover. “That’s a lot of food you’re ordering,” half-joked the man behind the counter. “You’re not reviewing us, are you?” “No, we’re just starving,” came our half-true reply, which increased in truthiness the moment we took a seat on a picnic bench outside. The barky velour of the brisket ($12 for 8 ounces) rivals that of 4 Rivers, Cecil’s or Pig Floyd’s, and we had an absolute fiery blast enjoying them with a trio of experimental spicy barbecue sauces. (You can try them too – just ask for the “hots.”) It was a rush mopping carefully cubed burnt ends ($7 for 4 ounces), most of which were wonderfully succulent, with a sweet and fruity burner of a sauce. We wouldn’t have known the pulled pork was seasoned with rib drippings, brown sugar and butter had we not been told as much, but it might’ve explained why we thought so highly of the flavorful strands gracing the butcher paper on our metal tray. A side of fried-to-order okra ($2) was literally popping fresh, and the collards ($1.50) were served just the way we like ’em – wet and hammy. But our dance cards were still filled with the names of many a meat, so next we grooved to the sweet sounds of ribs ($8 for a quarter-rack) being masticated, on and on and on. The competition-worthy St. Louis-style ribs are smoked, rubbed in sugar and spice and buttered up nice, then smoked again. Then we gave pulled chicken ($6 for 4 ounces) a whirl (but not before a proper-good saucing), and then swayed to the smoky, if slightly salty, smoked half-chicken ($8). Sides of mac and cheese ($2.50) and sweetish baked beans ($1.50) added an additional heft to our gluttonous gambol, as did pale-yellow blocks of addictive cornbread, made from an old family recipe and included in every order. We didn’t care much for grainy banana pudding ($3), but we were proud of ourselves for keeping the whole excessive meal down (which was performing its own sort of dance in our stretched bellies). When it came time to take a breather, we breathed and did so without feeling rushed to leave. Nah, things are pretty chill here, so much so that you’d never guess Fuel was adding fire to Sanford’s smoking-hot food scene.

Most of our products, such as BBQs, smokers, outdoor kitchens, and rotisseries, are classified as bulky goods . Standard courier deliveries are kerbside delivery only , which means your order will be delivered to the nearest accessible point at your property (e.g., driveway, garage entrance, or front door if accessible without stairs). Please note: Couriers will not carry items through your house, into backyards, or down the side of the house. If stairs, narrow paths, or difficult access are involved, the courier may leave the delivery at the safest accessible point. In some cases, if access is easier, couriers may place the item inside a garage or carport. This policy is in place to avoid risk of injury and to prevent any accidental damage to your home. Will the courier help carry my BBQ / Bulky Items inside or into the backyard? No. Standard courier services operate with one driver only , and bulky items can weigh 50–150kg+. This means drivers cannot safely assist with moving your order beyond kerbside delivery. We recommend having someone available at the delivery address to assist with moving your items. What if I need extra assistance with delivery? We understand some customers want a more hands-on service, such as delivery to the backyard or through the side of the house. We are currently working with our courier partners to offer an upgraded delivery service (at an additional cost). Once available, this option will be shown at checkout. In the meantime, if you require anything beyond standard kerbside delivery, please contact our sales team on 1300 041 051 before placing your order. Do you deliver to unit or apartment addresses? Yes, we deliver to units and apartments across Australia. However, all bulky goods are delivered on a ground floor/kerbside basis only . This means: The courier will deliver your order to the building entrance, loading dock, or nearest safe ground-level point. Couriers are not able to take items upstairs, into lifts, or through common areas of apartment buildings. Delivery drivers usually operate solo, so they cannot carry heavy or bulky items beyond ground floor access. Tip: If you live in a unit, please ensure someone is available to assist on delivery day or arrange additional help (e.g., building management, friends, or a removalist). How are fridges and freezers delivered? Fridges and freezers are shipped directly from our Melbourne warehouse. Dispatch occurs every Monday from Melbourne for all interstate paid orders where the item is in stock. To be included in Monday’s dispatch, your order must be confirmed and paid by the Friday before dispatch . Estimated delivery timeframes: Sydney customers: Deliveries typically arrive Thursday or Friday of the same week. Other interstate customers: Delivery times vary depending on location, but dispatch will always occur on the Monday following your confirmed order. Tracking details will be provided once your fridge/freezer has been dispatched and the courier delivering your items will call you the day of delivery to provide an ETA. How can I prepare for my delivery? To make delivery as smooth as possible: Ensure someone is home to receive the order and assist if needed. Clear driveways, paths, or entry points for easy access. Have a trolley or an extra set of hands ready for heavier items. If your building requires a loading dock booking or special access, please notify our team ahead of time. How much does delivery cost? Delivery costs are calculated based on the size and weight of the item together with the delivery postcode . You can check the delivery cost for your order by entering your postcode in the shipping calculator at checkout. Bulky goods (such as BBQs, smokers, and fridges) are heavier and may attract higher delivery fees than smaller accessories. How long does delivery take? Delivery times depend on: The product ordered (some items ship from different warehouses) Your delivery location Courier availability in your area As a guide: Metro Sydney: usually 3–5 business days Other metro areas (Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, etc.): 5–10 business days Regional areas: delivery may take longer, depending on location and courier routes Please note: these are estimates only. Once your order is dispatched, you’ll receive tracking information so you can follow your delivery progress.

JAMES BRACE heads for the woods near his Sussex home, laden with bags of charcoal to cook over ﻿For as long as I can remember, I’ve been hypnotised by fire. From helping my nan light the open fire on Christmas morning with kindling and coal, to being transfixed by the flames in the fireplace of my grandpa’s cottage. So it was no surprise that, as I grew up, I’d be drawn to cooking over fire and the love of a barbecue. The sizzle of meat hitting the grill, the tantalising aroma wafting through the air, and the mouth-watering flavours that result from the cooking process, all add to the allure of this culinary experience – that’s part of the magic. There is nothing more enriching and wholesome than lighting a fire, running some meat and vegetables through it and sharing laughs and food with family and friends. If my guests leave with full bellies, then my heart is full. Recently, we have seen the explosion in interest in outdoor cooking in the UK, with an array of great grills complemented by great fuel. Charcoal is a culinary trigger for me. It means fire food is coming, both a romantic and primal awakening. Fuel is a vital ingredient for any BBQ, and I mean ingredient. When it comes to cooking, I will buy and source the best meat or vegetables I can afford, and this applies to the charcoal too. View fullsize View fullsize What is charcoal? When we go to pick up a bag, do we really know what we’re buying or looking for? Charcoal is defined as: ‘a black, lightweight, and porous form of carbon created through a process called pyrolysis. It is produced by heating organic material, such as wood or coconut shells, in the absence of oxygen. This lack of oxygen prevents the material from burning completely, resulting in the formation of charcoal.’ Yet, as with most things, not all charcoal is created equal. Time to fire up the Weber Master-Touch 57, with and without the charcoal baskets, and test some of the coals on the market. First up, Birchwood Forestry, a fourth-generation family business in Herefordshire, sourcing raw timber from local woodlands and supplying independent farm shops and butchers with its sustainable lumpwood charcoal. I cooked some venison over a batch of the oak charcoal, with excellent heat retention and a clean burn. I also used some of the apple charcoal in combination with wild cherry wood chunks, ideal for a smoked pork shoulder. When tending a fire, don’t fiddle and adjust unnecessarily, randomly poking with a stick and invariably destroying the structure you’ve built. A lot of energy gets wasted that way. This is especially true with charcoal. If you get the zones and bed right from the start, the rest falls into place. Let the fuel do its thing. Next in the grill was Globaltic and its lumpwood charcoal from Ukrainian silver birch trees, using just the core, ensuring large chunks for long burn times. The coals lit well, creating a nice bed to cook on, with even heat distribution, making multizone cooking easy to manage. View fullsize View fullsize Time to try lumpwood charcoal from a kamado grill manufacturer. Big Green Egg states that each of its three pure lumpwood charcoals ‘will enhance your cook in a different way’. It also advocates ‘dirty cooking’ directly on the coals, such is the confidence in its purity and quality. It’s a versatile charcoal and, says Big Green Egg, brings well-rounded smokiness to a brisket, a roast chicken, or a whole side of salmon. I selected the oak and hickory flavour, having only used hickory before in my offset cooks. I went for a tri-tip of beef – good flavour and great heat release throughout, managed by controlling the airflow, with the coal responding well. I had also taken delivery of a big bag of ACH15 restaurant grade lumpwood and a box of Binchotan charcoal from Big K, burning well from the start and maintaining a great source of heat throughout. View fullsize View fullsize Big K dates back nearly 60 years when founder Theodoros Kleanthous immigrated to the UK from Cyprus, setting up his own restaurant in London. He could not find the right charcoal for his authentic Greek cooking, so brought it in from Cyprus. Binchotan charcoal is typically used in a Konro-style grill. I went with yakitori chicken skewers and also reverse seared some ribeye steaks on the Master-Touch, with the crust on the steaks from the intense sear to finish something to behold. Kamado Joe’s Big Block charcoal is big in size and flavour. The bigger blocks of this XL lumpwood were destined for my Country Fire Kitchen stand where, even open to unlimited oxygen, they produced a sustained level of heat and had a great burn time. Kamado Joe, purveyors of the iconic red ceramic grills, worked with ‘Argentinian charcoal masters’ to develop an exclusive blend of hardwoods. Such is the density they are known as axe breakers by the locals, with the natural lump charcoal burning long and clean. Black Dog Forestry, from Wiston in West Sussex, was, says director Alistair Sowter, “born from a love of the great outdoors and sustainable woodland management.” You had me at black dog Alistair, especially if a puppy! View fullsize View fullsize The Black Dog lumpwood charcoal, made in house, arrived in solid 3kg and 7.5kg bags with a lovely twine stitching. You instantly notice how clean the coals are – no smell, no residue, just carbon and ready to go. I actually used the bag as a firelighter and the coals were ready in under five minutes. I grilled some sea bass and tenderstem broccoli, with the Black Dog coals tickling the fillets and vegetables with heat and flavour, perfect for the delicate ingredients. I then went for some steak for extra protein, and potatoes for home fries the next day, making use of some of the residual heat. Let’s end with Weber, my first love and my first grill and a brand I still use today and at least three times a week. I was sent Weber’s regular briquettes, as well as coconut shell ones. The briquettes lend themselves to the longer cooks due to their uniform size and shape, ensuring a more guaranteed burn time and heat outlay. View fullsize View fullsize I used a classic snake method of arranging the briquettes part of the way round my kettle and lit one end with two chunks of smoking wood at the beginning of the snake. The coconut shell variety contains no wood, just carbonised coconut shells and tapioca starch. The briquettes were a solid performer on this longer cook, which helps to minimise the variables when fire cooking. It is important to pay as much attention to your fuel as you do to your food selection when prepping for a barbecue. A well-managed fire doesn’t need loads of fuel, so go easy with the initial pour; you can always shut down your grill by closing the vents and with quality charcoal you can save it for the next cook.
