Discover Solutions Success Pricing Resources Contact Get a Demo Login Blog Home Corporate Ladder Brewing Climbs to New Heights in Craft Beer Corporate Ladder Brewing Climbs to New Heights in Craft Beer By: Giovanni Albanese Published: January 30, 2024 Wearing a suit and grinding it out with a nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday schedule is only for some. Punching your timecard and answering to The Man for eight hours until the glorious moment you punch out for the day is daunting. Doing that day in and day out can certainly take a toll on the psyche and overall morale. Corporate Ladder Brewing asks the question: Why not stick it to The Man? The Palmetto, Florida-based brewery takes this quite literally, with their rags story turning to riches in just a few short years. We chatted with the co-founder of Corporate Ladder, one of our most successful Ollie partners, to hear their story of bucking the corporate grind and turning a passion for beer into a growing, award-winning brewery.

Δ What Is the Corporate Ladder Origin Story? Corporate Ladder Brewing Company Co-Founders Blake Kleppe (on the left) and James Herrholz (on the right) | Photography courtesy of Corporate Ladder Brewing Company Founded in the spring of 2018 by Blake Kleppe, Corporate Ladder represents Kleppe’s jump from corporate to community. “Corporate Ladder Brewing Company is the fire inside all of us yearning to break free from the norm, to chase your passion and abandon the nine to five,” the company’s website explains. “Each beer is dedicated to forgetting every cubicle you’ve ever sat in and to every boss who just didn’t quite get it.” In 2019, Co-Owner James Herrholz joined the culinary-inspired brewery. “We do a variety of different hazy IPAs using different hops, fruited sours , lagers, stouts ,” Herrholz says. “We do different beers across different styles while keeping the finger on the pulse of the market.” The brewery sits in a 2,400-square-foot building, which includes a taproom and seating in the front of the house, with the back of the house featuring a five-barrel, two-vessel hot side system, a canning line, a ten-barrel Brite, a five-barrel Brite, six ten-barrel fermenters, four five-barrel fermenters, and some cold room storage, Herrholz explains. Each beer is dedicated to forgetting every cubicle you’ve ever sat in and to every boss who just didn’t quite get it. Corporate Ladder Brewing Company - Blake Kleppe Recently, the company did a remodel. “We lost some seating but gained perceptive space,” Herrholz says, noting the taproom has forty-six seats and couches inside, as well as some outdoor seating. He says there are plans also to add a kitchen to the taproom. “If we can, we will. If not, we will look elsewhere to add one.” Return to top Where Does the Name ‘Corporate Ladder’ Come From? Photography courtesy of Corporate Ladder Brewing Company “It was an excuse for Blake to run away from the corporate world, where he did insurance and finance,” Herrholz says. In addition to the remodel at the Palmetto taproom, the company rebranded recently. “In the early days, the company was hyper-specific to Blake,” Herrholz says. “We changed the tagline [of the company] to be more encompassing.” We wanted to change the norm. Corporate Ladder Brewing Company - James Herrholz Herrholz adds, “Before the rebrand, the tagline was ‘Quit Work. Brew Beer.’ Now the tagline is ‘Defy the Grind. Be Your Own Boss.’” Herrholz says the new branding effort reflects Corporate Ladder’s goal to move away from the corporate world and to own your own socially responsible place. “Dream big, pursue passions, while avoiding poor business practices, bad management, poor pay,” Herrholz says. “We wanted to change the norm.” He adds, “We do that by enabling our team and our customers to see that through our lens with our beers.” The rebrand coincided with the company’s personnel growth. Herrholz explains how, in the early days, it was just himself and Kleppe doing all the work, and they were stretched thin, limiting themselves. In 2021, Corporate Ladder brought on a couple of integral parts—“cornerstone pieces,” as Herrholz describes—to the team from Urban South Brewing in Houston. Justin Slanina and Angela Slanina came as a team and essentially ran the back of the house in Florida. “We vibed with them a lot, and we knew we needed brewing talent to move this [company] forward,” Herrholz says. “We brought them on and gave them time to get acquainted with who we are and let them do what they want based on that.” Return to top What Is the Brewing Ethos of Corporate Ladder? Photography courtesy of Corporate Ladder Brewing Company “Creative is the biggest word for sure,” Herrholz says. “We’re also nostalgia-driven and make culinary-inspired beers. We hang our hat on emulating the desserts as best we can [in beer series like our most sought-after Dessert Station ]; cherry pie needs to taste like liquid cherry pie.” Herrholz says that the company also strives to make beers for everyone. “Beer is inclusive, and we do our best to accommodate that while being fun and creative and finding new ways to do it,” he says. Among those are beer-flavored beers, lagers, stouts, barrel-aged stouts, hoppy beers, and more. Corporate Ladder’s taproom has nineteen tap handles, and Herrholz explains how they shoot for a bunch of lagers—eight were on tap at the time of publication—as well as IPAs, stouts, and lagers, which ebb and flow with seasonality and events. They even have some nitro or beer gas faucets and side-pulls for Czech-style lagers. Return to top What Are Corporate Ladder’s Core and Hype Beers? Photography courtesy of Corporate Ladder Brewing Company Herrholz points to the brewery’s Dessert Station: Intangible as its top core beer. Inspired by a creamsicle, the 6.5% ABV gluten-free sour beer includes tangerine and vanilla. “It’s our most popular beer. We have made it the most of any of the fruited beer,” Herrholz says. “It’s a nice mix of sweet and acidity from the tangerine. Not super thick, which makes it more approachable.” It’s been really fun to bring those beers to a wide audience. Corporate Ladder Brewing Company - James Herrholz Another core beer is their Paperweight Pilsner . The 5.5% ABV house lager is virtually always on tap and in cans at the taproom. “It’s a neo-American pilsner,” Herrholz says. “We make it with modern hops, including Motueka and Hallertau Blanc.” Herrholz says the brewery’s hyper-beer nerds flock to their barrel-aged stouts. “Usually, they are culinary-inspired, but we do a cocktail-inspired Tiki series,” he says. “It’s been really fun to bring those beers to a wide audience.” The Tiki Sour series includes a Pina Colada , Blue Hawaiian , Zombie , and Hurricane , among many others. Return to top Which Beer Brings Corporate Ladder the Most Pride? Photography courtesy of Corporate Ladder Brewing Company Without hesitation, Herrholz says it’s Board Meeting , a 14% ABV pastry stout brewed in collaboration with Bottle Logic Brewing . “We finished it with toasted coconut and three different varieties of vanilla beans,” Herrholz says. “It is a really cool beer across the board.” No pun intended, of course! Initially aged in an Old Fitzgerald barrel for eighteen months, Board Meeting spent an additional thirteen months in a Stag barrel. “I love the blending process of barrel-aged beers, with different wood, different spirits,” says Herrholz. “The depth is unparalleled and lends a cool drinking experience.” Board Meeting won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival last year in the first-ever pastry/dessert category, which Herrholz says fits Corporate Ladder. “This was the height of dessert beer and barrel-aged beer,” he says. “Marrying the two with care and effort paid off.” Corporate Ladder also won two silver medals in 2019, one for Contains Chocolate in the Chocolate Beer category and another for Dessert Station Cherry Almond Cookie in the Field Beer category. Return to top What’s Next for Corporate Ladder? Photography courtesy of Corporate Ladder Brewing Company For 2024, Corporate Ladder plans to expand with a full production facility set to open in Walstonburg, NC, about an hour east of Raleigh. The new spot will house a three-vessel, twenty-barrel system with a 10,000-square-foot warehouse space. Ultimately, Herrholz says this will allow Corporate Ladder to expand its distribution into Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The Florida taproom will remain status quo, and the brewing will feature R&D operations, more or less. We want to establish ourselves in this region ... Corporate Ladder Brewing Company - James Herrholz “We are taking those [core] beers away from them to let them brew up new, innovative beers,” Herrholz says. Outside of the production facility, in the short term, Herrholz will focus on opening another taproom and kitchen in North Carolina—somewhere in the Raleigh/Durham triangle. “We want to establish ourselves in this region as we make our production home here and build [and] evolve on that,” Herrholz says. “We also are working with cool executive chefs to make food and cocktails that blend with what we do as a company, with that whole inclusivity and creativity as the mantra.” Return to top About The Author Giovanni Albanese Giovanni is a content writer for Next Glass, contributing to the Ollie blog.

Blake was driven by a desire to distance himself from subpar business practices and the corporate landscape. He harbored a vision centered around diversity of thought, collective success, and shared experiences, all channeled through the medium of beer. In March 2019, eventual co-owner James Herrholz joined the team, infusing the venture with his unwavering passion for bold flavors. With a focus on culinary and dessert-inspired beers, Herrholz's expertise introduced a captivating dimension to the company's offerings. By integrating inventive and unconventional ingredients, these unique brews not only expanded the brewery's appeal but also resonated with a diverse and discerning audience. In a significant expansion move, Corporate Ladder secured a production facility in Walstonburg, NC, in December of 2023. Boasting a spacious 10,000 sq foot warehouse and a 20-bbl 3-vessel hot side, among other assets, we’ve elevated our brewing capabilities to be able to distribute our sought-after beers to diverse markets, spanning North Carolina, South Carolina and, naturally, Florida. Dedicated to the belief that beer should be a universal pleasure, Corporate Ladder strives to cater to all tastes. Our mission is to provide a diverse array of options, ranging from meticulously crafted traditional lagers to gluten-free beers inspired by decadent desserts and contemporary hop-forward beverages. At Corporate Ladder, we ensure there's a perfect choice for every palate.

Who We Are When you merge the best content with the best facilitation, you get the best results. Results We’ve worked with some of the smartest organizations on the planet. Contact Us Interested?  Let’s set up time to talk it over. FAQs A quick jump to the brass tacks. Search Search Submit Get In Touch We create world-class learning and development experiences for today’s rising leaders. Agility Matters. Top talent is often told, “Be more strategic.”  The reality is, few organizations equip them with the skills to do so.  That’s where we come in. Companies fall into the same trap. They develop their senior leaders at the top and new hires at the bottom. But they miss the beating heart of the enterprise — the critical middle.  And if your organization underinvests in its rising stars, they will likely walk right out the door and find a place that will invest in them.  Especially in today’s job market. Our Leadership Academies are: Designed to develop key business partnering skills Evolving continuously to meet the challenges of today’s quick pace Led by instructors who have thousands of hours with aspiring leaders around the world Facilitated in-person or virtual, but always live What words would you use to describe the last training course you attended? Choose all that apply. Well look at you! Sounds like someone had a great training experience, so you’ll understand why we’re different. Let us tell you more. Hmmm… a mixed bag.

Strategy Stakeholder Influence Problem Solving Financial Analysis Data Analytics Team Leadership Communications Change Agility What We Do Using well-known brands, we make this sometimes theoretical topic approachable and relevant.  We teach how strategy is created but also – just as importantly – how to effectively execute it. Social science teaches us that we can learn to become more persuasive with our stakeholders. Good problem-solving begins with a good problem statement.  After that, there’s a tried and true way to think all the way through to the root cause of an issue. We demystify the finance-speak and help practitioners uncover how money moves through an organization and how to build a solid business case for their initiatives. Teams are awash in data.  We teach to thoughtfully develop a hypothesis way before diving into the deep end.  There are some common traps teams fall into when using data to make decisions. We present actionable research on how to engender the most from a team and gain their buy-in. We all give and receive information differently.  If I can learn to flex my communications, I can supercharge them so that they are best received by my various audiences.

      "text": "Corporate Ladder brings craft brewery trend to Palmetto News Sports Ticket Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals DINING Corporate Ladder brings craft brewery trend to Palmetto Jimmy Geurts jimmy.geurts@heraldtribune.com I recently wrote a guide to Sarasota-Manatee’s breweries as the craft beer trend continues to grow locally in popularity. Indeed, another brewery opened just days after I wrote it. Corporate Ladder Brewing Company at 4935 96th St. E. in Palmetto opened its doors at the end of May and held a grand opening on July 14. It’s Sarasota-Manatee’s 12th brewery, the sixth in Manatee County, and the first in Palmetto. Blake Kleppe and Krista Brooks serve as co-owners and head brewers. Formerly from New England and now residing in Parrish, Kleppe told me that he and Brooks home-brewed for several years before deciding to open the brewery. Kleppe said the name Corporate Ladder comes from jobs the two held before pursuing their passion of brewing full-time, with its logo proclaiming “Quit work. Brew beer.” He also wanted to create a craft beer-friendly hangout in the Palmetto area he now calls home. “Corporate Ladder exists because it’s a couple of us chasing the dream, chasing the passion,” Kleppe said. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. The atmosphere I visit early Saturday evening soon after the grand opening, and it looks like Kleppe’s already succeeded at his goal of creating a popular craft beer spot for Palmetto. My group of four was just able to snag a place to sit, and the bar was busy for my whole visit. Corporate Ladder’s interior design right now is simple and functional, with several tables, the bar and not much else. One of the tables held several board and card games, and I saw some customers bring a cornhole set outside to play with. There’s also picnic table seating outside nearby where the food truck was parked. As you increasingly see in breweries, the crowd was wide-ranging in ages and interests: craft beer aficionados getting growlers filled, young groups out socially for drinks and some families with kids who seemed to be there for the food truck more than anything else. The drinks Corporate Ladder’s beers can be served as half or full pours, with no flights yet when I visited. I opted for the half pours ($3 each) so I could sample more brews in my visit. Several of the beers sport business-themed names and multiple variations. For instance, there’s their Mergers & Acquisitions Berliner Weisse, which came in pineapple, cherry, mixed berry or peach and habanero treatments when I visited. I tried the last one, which provides an interesting blend of the Berliner’s sourness, the peach’s sweetness and the habanero’s spiciness. On the other hand, their Casual Friday witbier has an easygoing, approachable taste fitting its name. On the darker side, there was a tasty chocolate coconut doppelbock and a solid milk stout. Kleppe told me he plans to keep their beer options diverse, whether it’s hazy New England-style IPAs or lighter lagers. The food Like many breweries, Corporate Ladder plans to offer dining options from visiting food trucks and local restaurant partners. They already have the former, with food trucks visiting Thursday through Sunday. The food truck there when I visited was the Surly Mermaid from Tampa, offering shrimp po-boy and pulled pork sandwiches as well as conch fritters and a Fruity Pebbles-covered churro called a “unicorn horn.” I tried the veggie muffuletta ($9), a take on the New Orleans sandwich that replaces the Italian meats with portabella, eggplant, zucchini, squash and red peppers, but keeps the olive salad and seasoning. Next door to Corporate Ladder is TK Grill, a brick-and-mortar version of Bradenton area food truck the Traveling Kitchen that plans to open in early fall . The restaurant will feature favorite items from the food truck, including Cuban sandwiches with Latin-style smoked pulled pork. Kleppe said that once TK Grill opens, they plan a partnership where you can have food delivered to the brewery or bring beer over to the restaurant. In time, I could see the plaza becoming a spot that draws not just residents from Palmetto, but Sarasota-Manatee at large.
