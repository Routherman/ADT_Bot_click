While we have a number of exciting business and industrial success stories, it's hard to beat early morning fishing on Lake Okeechobee. Whether it's landing a trophy fish or just the relaxing view of a variety of Florida's wildlife in their natural habitat waking up to a cool sunrise breeze, you'll fall in love with Okeechobee.  In contrast, there's the excitement of a number of nationally sanctioned professional bass fishing tournaments. Okeechobee is known as the \"Speckled Perch Capital of the World\" so it is only fitting that we hold an annual event in honor of this title. The Speckled Perch Festival, sponsored by the Okeechobee Main Street , is our largest festival of the year and is held in March. Each year this downtown event attracts thousands of out of town visitors and locals alike. It's kicked off by a parade that wraps around Flagler Park. Hundreds of craft and food vendors are scattered about, the most popular being the Seminole booths with their colorful jackets and crafts for sale as well as their delicious pumpkin bread. There's also the Okeechobee Cattlemen's Rodeo and the Okeechobee County Fair going on at the Agri-Center. We have a vibrant business district, but as our Okeechobee Main Street logo states we have 'old values and new visions'.  On the 4th Saturday in July we have the Day of the Cowboy event, which includes a cattle drive through our town.  Yes, we do things like that in Okeechobee! Our location makes Okeechobee the Gateway to South Florida with convenient access to both coasts and all of Central Florida. ( Locate Okeechobee ) Commercial and industrial concerns have found that Okeechobee is the place you want to be and along with the Chamber of Commerce of Okeechobee County we've taken an aggressive attitude toward seeking new businesses in our two local Industrial Parks. We could go on about all the amenities we have to offer, but we want to invite you to visit our town and discover it for yourself.  We think you'll find that our community prides itself most on the hospitality of its residents.
