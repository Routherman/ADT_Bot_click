Fall is in the air and so is the 12th Annual Native Rhythms Festival honoring Native American Heritage Month. Adhering to social distancing standards, the Indian River Flute Circle and Native Heritage Gathering will host the event virtually this weekend, Nov. 14-15, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. As always, the festival is a family-friendly affair and free to the public. “We’re grateful to offer the event in 2020, and excited to showcase our performers on a more personal level, which is difficult to do on a live stage,” said Martha Pessaro, event chair, finance, and performer coordinator. Debuting this year are a series of videos called Backstage Passes in which headline performers will introduce themselves on an intimate level. Keep an eye out for familiar Grammy, Nammy (Native American Music awards) & ISM (Indian Summer Music Awards) winners, such as Shelley Morningsong & Fabian Fontonelle, Billy Whitefox, Ed Windancer, and Randy Granger. In addition, the live performances will take us to their neck of the woods as they transport us on a virtual trip across the United States from Zuni, New Mexico, through Iowa cornfields, and up through Maine. “The educational segments are excellent this year and each unit will remain on our YouTube channel after the event for educator classroom use,” Ms. Pessaro said. In order to retain the integrity of the judging process, the artisanal competitions are canceled for this year. However, you’ll be able to “walk” through Vendor Village in which talented craftspeople will provide videos of their booths and provide websites for purchasing their many Native American wares. Workshops and demonstrations will be exhibited online and will also remain available after the event for your continued viewing pleasure. A schedule of all performances & workshops will be provided for viewers and fans alike, and access will be made available on their website, Facebook page, and Youtube channel. There’s no reason to miss any of this year's fun. You can watch the live performances, and tune back in for workshops and educational segments, or vica-versa. “We learned a lot about hosting an online venture and are happy to have pulled it together. We’re having fun with all the new modules and are blessed to hold the event,” continued Ms. Pessaro. While they plan to return live at the Wickham Park Amphitheatre next year, “once it is safe to do so,” they also plan to include many of these new online modules in the future for a more complete and thorough experience.

      "text": "EventCrazy.com In 1991, a small group of people began a publication titled, The Special Events Directory. The premise was simple,  deliver accurate, compiled information about the events industry. It was a revolutionary tool for event professionals  such as event vendors, suppliers and service providers. It was over 800 pages of previously unavailable information that grew  into a new industry and it was produced by Events Media for over 10 years. The explosion of the Internet as the source of \"instant\" information was just beginning. After the early years of the printed version, the Special Events Directory evolved into an online presence under the name www.eventcrazy.com. In 1998, eventcrazy.com exploded onto the  Internet \"event\" landscape. We took our existing data and created a simple, revolutionary and easy to navigate search  system developed and created by our inhouse team. It was a breakthrough technology that could help people in the events industry such  as vendors, suppliers and venues. But it also was the #1 source for just anyone looking for places to go and things to do all over the  United States and Canada. Along with our own site, Events Media, the parent company of eventcrazy.com began licensing our information to the major online players; Lycos, Google, The Weather Channel, Microsoft, Hilton Hotels, Accuweather, Synacor and many, many more.  All of the movers and shakers at the infancy of the Internet were people that used the EventCrazy feed in their online sites. Many things have happened in the evolution and changing landscape of the Internet. We are proud of what we have  accomplished and of what we meant to the launch of the Internet for commercial purposes.  We delivered a remarkable product for years and we were one of the firsts of the firsts. Our legacy speaks for itself. Our trailblazing ideas helped, in some small way, to change the event landscape by delivering instant results for people  looking for something to do \"NOW\". So now the time has come for us to have our own personal \"events\". It is time for all of us to reap the benefits of our hard work of the last 34 years.  We sincerely thank all of our users as we announce our retirement. We are proud of what we began and of all the  wonderful event experiences we navigated our users to visit for their enjoyment. So few professions and websites can claim  that they have been responsible for creating fabulous memories and memorable experiences to last a lifetime. Thank you to all of our friends, we wish you health and happiness and a continued life of event experiences! Maria, Marshall, Brad, Jen, Doug and the entire EventCrazy team. EventCrazy and it's .com domain names are for sale. If interested, please contact us at info@eventcrazy.com"

There are many music festival companies on the market today. Why Choose Rhythms International? There are many reason but here are some of the most essential Education! Rhythms is not a competition based festival. It is a participation festival where everyone leaves a winner. The only reason that some of our judges will work exclusively for us is because we are devoted to musical education. We do not want to dishearten the growing musician and have them return home and drop music. Adjudication & Judges!

Rhythms has a policy of never canceling a festival due to lack of groups interested in a specific destination. Even if you are alone we do not CANCEL. Non-Competitive! Rhythms International is, above all else devoted to the highest quality of music education we are a NON-COMPETITIVE company based on group participation. All groups are rated against themselves and not compared to other groups within the festival. Our concept is to motivate every participant to want to continue their musical venture and improve through our educational process. There is no 1st or 2nd place. Everyone leaves a winner for having participated and done their best. Extras! Upon request we may also incorporate public performances at local schools, public areas, churches etc. This will help build up your group’s confidence and experience while playing in front of a live audience at your selected destination. Custom Music Festivals in Canada & USA How Does A Rhythms Music Festival Work? When you register for a Rhythms Festival you will register all of your various ensembles. Vocal groups, choirs, show choirs, color guards, orchestras, stage bands, senior and junior jazz bands, wind ensembles etc… We will also ask that you forward some information on the performing group itself and their director. Upon reception of your information we choose from our fine selection of adjudicators those best suited for each ensemble and schedule the judges for the event. You may register as many groups as you wish who will be traveling with you. Adjudication schedules are prepared according to the final itinerary we receive from your travel operator. They will plan with you to make sure that everything goes just right. We ask that you provide us with the stage set-up you require for your performance. Upon arrival at the destination you will be greeted by a Rhythms International Music Festivals Supervisor who will go over any last minute details for your performance. Adjudications are normally scheduled for the Saturday, Sunday or both depending on your ensemble(s). You will normally arrive at the festival venue one hour prior to your performance. The Rhythms International Music Festivals venue hosts will guide your group to the warm-up room. Your group will be left alone to prepare for the performance. When the time has come a Rhythms host will escort you to the stage which has been preset according to the plan you submitted. The Festivals Supervisor will introduce you to the judges for your performance. You will provide them with an original copy of your scores at this time. Back on stage, the manager will present your group and signal the beginning of the performance. You are asked to perform for a maximum of 30 minutes. When you are finished two of the three judges present will come on stage and conduct a clinic with you and your group for the rest of your hour. The director may stay with them if you so wish. When the hour is finished the judges then get together and finish their paperwork on your group while awaiting the arrival of the next group. These documents, tapes etc… are then put in an envelope which will be handed to you at the Rhythms International Music Festivals Awards Banquet on Sunday night along with your Rhythms International Music Festivals Participation Plaque. Please note that it is your choice whether your performance is rated or not. If you wish to be rated, a small engraved plaque with your rating will be given to you with the adjudication tapes and notes. It is designed to be placed upon your Rhythms International Music Festivals Participation Plaque should you decide to do so.

Photo courtesy of Lou Seiler Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save BREVARD COUNTY — The 13th annual Native Rhythms Festival returns to Wickham Park next month in celebration of Native American Heritage Month. The event is brought to the public by Indian River Flute Circle and Native Heritage Gathering, Inc. by showcasing world-class performers, specialty crafts and instruments, along with workshops. Mark your calendars, the three-day weekend begins Friday, Nov. 12 and runs through the 14th at Wickham Park, 2500 Parkway Drive, Melbourne. Entrance is free to all who attend. Native American Heritage Month is a time to celebrate rich and diverse cultures, traditions and histories, and to acknowledge the important contributions of Native people. “People enjoy coming to see the performers and the talented craftspeople,” said John Ellis, co-founder of Native Rhythms Festival. Attendees can join in a workshop for a small fee, which goes toward covering the cost of supplies. Workshops provide a exclusive opportunity to learn more about Native American culture from professionals. Activities include Basic Introduction to Native American Style Flute, Understanding Pow Wow Drumming, Making a Leather Pouch for Sacred Tobacco/Cedar/Sage, Making a Talking Stick and its Importance, Video Production, Reading Nakai Tablature, and more. “We’ll have a gentleman there named John Pasko who studied with one of the last of the World War II Navajo code talkers,” Mr. Ellis said. “He’ll do a presentation on what he’s learned from his friend about the code talkers and the whole history of that. He’s got some artifacts that were brought back from World War II.” The event financially supports Vision Maker Media, a nonprofit organization that shares Native stories with the world through support of the creation, promotion and distribution of Native media.
