Media Team Team Chrissy Wittmann Director of Winemaking, General Manager BIO × Chrissy Wittmann Chrissy Wittmann never intended to have a career in the wine industry. All she knew was that she wanted a life outside of her home town of Burbank, California, with its endless miles of concrete and urban sprawl. An avid participant in sports—softball, volleyball, basketball and some occasional skiing—Chrissy pursued a degree in Physical Education at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. In her freshman year, Chrissy rekindled her love of nature during biology field trips and changed her major to Ecology and Systematic Biology. With her B.S. Ecology and Systematic Biology degree, Chrissy began work at an independent environmental chemistry lab analyzing soil and waste water samples. Her first peek into the wine industry came when she filled in for a vacationing co-worker in the lab’s wine division. “I didn’t completely understand what I was doing at first,” recalls Chrissy, “in part because, at the time, I was a beer and ‘7 & 7’ kind of gal.” But her interest was piqued, two years later, she became a Wine Chemist at Meridian. After two years with Meridian, she was promoted to Laboratory Enologist. Realizing she needed further education, Chrissy returned to Cal Poly, where she earned an M. S. in Agriculture with a concentration in Food Science. She wrote her thesis, a dissertation on seed color and extractable tannin in Syrah during ripening, while she worked as the Lab Manager and Production Winemaker at Courtside Cellars. In 2005, Advance degree in hand, Chrissy became the Assistant Winemaker at Scheid Vineyards, where she hit the ground running.  “That first year was a huge harvest, at least for me, with 12,000 tons of grapes coming into a brand new facility in which new systems were being tested for the first time ever,” she recalls. Chrissy rose to all the challenges. Chrissy was thrilled when the Wild Horse Winery & Vineyards Assistant Winemaker position was available essentially ‘in her backyard.’ “You couldn’t live in San Luis Obispo without knowing and loving Wild Horse,” she says. “And it could not have been more fortuitous, since my husband and I had just welcomed the birth of our first son six months earlier.” Just one year later, in 2008, Chrissy’s dream of becoming a winemaker was realized when she was promoted to the position of Winemaker; and in 2013 she was promoted to Director of Winemaking at Wild Horse Winery & Vineyards. “I couldn’t be happier.” Chrissy continues. “When I was younger, I hated the idea of spending my life sitting behind a desk all day. I wanted to be where things were happening. I wanted to have an opportunity to be outside and I wanted to be challenged every day.  And I’ve got all that here.” When not busy at the winery, Chrissy enjoys spending time with her husband and two sons. Their family time includes trips to Zion or Yosemite National Parks, multiple Bruce Springsteen concerts and San Francisco Giants’ baseball games.

Brennan holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Political Science from Yale University. Deborah Brenner Founder & President, Women of the Vine & Spirits BIO × Deborah Brenner Deborah Brenner, Founder & President, Women of the Vine & Spirits Deborah Brenner graduated from the University of Delaware with degrees in English and Journalism, and was soon hired by a television and film technology company that required international travel to countries for which wine is a part of everyday life. After over 20 years in the male-dominated field of high-end technology and owning a marketing and public relations firm, Ms. Brenner discovered during a fortuitous trip to Napa and Sonoma that many women in the wine industry - like in her own industry - are under-recognized. Compelled to tell their stories, she authored a bestselling collection of profiles on women in the wine industry, Women of the Vine: Inside the World of Women Who Make, Taste and Enjoy Wine, which Wine Spectator named a Critical Read of 2007. Through the process of writing the book and championing its subjects, Ms. Brenner became inspired to enter the wine business herself, releasing wine from a first-of-its-kind collective of seven artisan women winemakers from Napa, Sonoma and Paso Robles. For the following seven years, Ms. Brenner learned the business inside and out, but but eventually saw that producing wine wasn't the most effective way to support and advance women's careers in the wine industry. Shuttering the brand, she returned to the drawing board. After one year of thought, research, and long conversations, Brenner organized a first-of-its-kind event: the inaugural Women of the Vine Global Symposium. The conference, first held in March of 2015, existed to support, educate, and connect women working in the alcohol beverage industry; registration sold out quickly to 500 women from five countries. Given the overwhelming response, Brenner and the Women of the Vine Advisory Board went to work developing a consortium that supports professionals in the alcohol beverage industry year-round. Thus emerged the Women of the Vine Alliance, a membership-based organization, anchored by the annual Symposium, whose mission is to empower and equip women worldwide to advance their careers in the alcohol beverage industry, fostering gender diversity and talent development across the industry at large. Ms. Brenner has received a Rising Star Award from Women for WineSense (2008), a New York Small Business Administration Women in Business Champion Of The Year (2009), a New York City National Association of Women Business Owners Signature Award (2010), the Lillian Vernon Award for Outstanding Community Service by the Women's Enterprise Development Center (2011), a NY Women in Communications Rising Star Award (2013), and the Rockland Business Women's Network Woman of the Year Award (2014). She is also a member of Senator Gillibrand's NY Agriculture Working Group. She resides in Rockland County, New York. Karena Breslin Vice President, Digital Marketing, Constellation Brands Inc.

Laure Colombo Winemaker, Vins Jean-Luc Colombo BIO × Laure Colombo Laure Colombo, Winemaker, Vins Jean-Luc Colombo (Rhone Valley, France) Only 30 years old and already a rising star of the Rhone Valley! Where does the fire and passion within her come from? When you meet Laure’s parents you understand that it is a typical trait of the Colombo family. Cornas is where she grew up. The vineyard was her playground. There she learned to love nature. She breathed in scents and aromas of all kinds, the very stuff that will bring any adult back to their childhood in a second. She first studied a master’s degree in business in Lille. Following graduation she worked for a few months in the USA (at Disney World for the Epcot Food & Wine Festival, at George Magazine and Wine & Spirit Magazine among others and as an aide-sommelier for Alain Ducasse at the Essex House). Her next step was to develop skills in marketing and communication with the prestigious Champagne houses of Dom Pérignon and Moët & Chandon and then with an Indian winery, Grover Vineyard, in New Delhi. She then returned to France, got a degree in viticulture in Bordeaux working part time at Château Haut Brion for one year, then followed up with a master’s degree in oenology in Montpellier and a few vintages on the Southern hemisphere. She became a winemaker and joined the family domain in 2010, now working as a viticulturist, oenologist, and brand ambassador all around the world. She’s also developing her own estate on Saint Péray’s heights. About Vins Jean-Luc Colombo Hailed as the winemaking wizard of the Rhône, founder Jean-Luc Colombo has achieved a high-profile international reputation for making innovative wines that are original, memorable and bursting with personality. Despite a resolute aversion to change in the Cornas region, Colombo has brazenly introduced innovative methods in his vineyards and throughout the production process based on a respect for nature and his fundamental belief that good wine is the culmination of three key elements: terroir, human endeavor and modern winemaking techniques. The result? A more accessible style of Rhône Valley wines, reflecting an exuberance of fruit and depth of expression and showcasing the full potential of the Syrah grape when grown in the unique terroir of Cornas. Through his intense dedication, Colombo has brought the wines of Cornas into the international limelight. The company now embraces wines representing major appellations of the Rhône Valley as well as the Languedoc and Roussillon regions of southern France. Colombo’s daughter, Laure, joined her father and mother as winemaker in 2010. The wines of Jean-Luc Colombo are imported to the US by Palm Bay International.

Gallo Winery BIO × Gina Gallo Gina Gallo: From Family Apprentice to Artisanal Winemaker The Gallo Signature Series is a collection of wines handcrafted by Gina Gallo, the acclaimed third-generation winemaker from one of America’s most historic winemaking families. In many ways, these wines are the culmination of Gina’s journey as a winemaker, from her days spent walking in the vineyards with her grandfather Julio, to her time in the cellar, honing her craft as an artisanal winemaker. A Winemaker’s Journey Gina’s journey as a winemaker began when she was just 10 years old, tending the gardens with her father and grandfather and picking fruits and vegetables that her mother and grandmother would turn into family meals.  One of eight brothers and sisters, Gina has fond memories of working alongside her family. She spent her high school summers working at the Gallo family’s winery, and she joined the Gallo sales team after earning her bachelor’s degree from Notre Dame de Namur University. It’s no surprise that Gina found her true calling as a winemaker, following in her grandfather’s footsteps. She studied winemaking at the University of California at Davis and later became an apprentice winemaker at the Gallo family’s experimental micro-winery in Modesto, CA. Under the tutelage of Julio Gallo and Marcello Monticelli, a 30-year veteran of the Gallo team, Gina flourished as a winemaker. Three years later, she completed her first full harvest in Sonoma County, working side by side with her brother, Matt.  He grew the grapes and she made the wine, in a partnership that has thrived for more than two decades. Nurturing a Personal Passion Today, as the winemaker behind the Gallo Signature Series, Gina is intimately engaged with these special wines from the Gallo family’s premier estate vineyards in Napa, Sonoma and Monterey counties. She carves out the specific blocks on her family’s most sought-after vineyards to hand craft limited batches of wine. Gina’s personal passion is behind each bottle of Gallo Signature Series wine, which is why her signature is printed on every label. “This endeavor has allowed me to follow a deep passion that was instilled in me by my grandfather Julio so many years ago: to craft wine with care, from start to finish,” explains Gina. “The Gallo Signature Series allows me to work with the best grapes from a handful of vineyard blocks on our incredible estate properties. I am able to stay close to the wines in the cellar, so that I can create something truly special. This is why I became a winemaker in the first place.” Danielle Frank National Accounts Director, Casinos, Moët Hennessy USA BIO × Danielle Frank Originally from New York, following graduating from the University of Wisconsin, Danielle immediately pursued a career in the film industry, something she always wanted to do.

Her California adventure began as a personal publicist representing some of the top talent in the entertainment industry however she decided to make a change to pursue her other passion of food & wine/spirits. She went from a VP at Miramax to starting at the bottom of the ranks to begin a new career in the wine & spirits industry, working for Bacardi USA. She worked for Bacardi USA for close to 10 years before joining Moet Hennessy USA just over a year ago to expand her portfolio of not only selling spirits but wine and champagne, as well.

Cristina Mariani-May Co-Chief Executive Officer, Banfi Vintners BIO × Cristina Mariani-May CRISTINA MARIANI-MAY \"We are selling not just wine, but a way of life. It’s about something slower, calmer, more in touch with family.” -- Cristina Mariani-May Cristina Mariani-May is the family proprietor of the internationally renowned Castello Banfi vineyard estate in Montalcino, Tuscany, and co-CEO of Banfi Vintners, a leading U.S. importer of fine wines. The youngest daughter of Banfi Chairman Emeritus, John F. Mariani, Jr., Ms. Mariani-May, together with her cousin James Mariani, represents the third generation of family leadership in the company founded by their grandfather, John Mariani, Sr. in 1919. Soon after completing her studies at  Georgetown University and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business, Mariani-May joined Banfi in 1993. Among the first of many forward-thinking initiatives introduced by Mariani-May was the creation of progressive new tracking and monitoring systems at Castello Banfi, designed to elevate performance and establish new goals in the fields of customer satisfaction, environmental responsibility and social responsibility. In 2006 those procedures paid off when Castello Banfi became the only winery in the world to achieve ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and SA 8000 certification acknowledging leadership in these areas. This accomplishment underlines the strategic long-term vision, coupled with an ability to execute, that characterize her management of Castello Banfi. A “pursuit of excellence” serves as a personal mantra for Mariani-May. It extends to every aspect of her work, in particular her family’s wines and nowhere more so than with the Brunellos for which Castello Banfi is renowned. Alone among producers of Brunello di Montalcino wines, Castello Banfi has conducted ground-breaking research aimed at defining and isolating the finest clones of the Sangiovese Grosso grape. Initiated in the early 1980s, the project moved into high gear after Mariani-May joined the company. From an original catalog of over 600 types, 15  have since been determined to possess the greater part of the grape’s inherent characteristics. Today Banfi has definitive results for six clones and research continues on the remaining nine. And like any good neighbor, Banfi has shared those results, as well as registering them in 1996 with the European Community. Of Italy’s 45 nationally approved clones for Sangiovese, six are from Castello Banfi. Enterprise and readiness to experiment also factor into Mariani-May’s leadership, as illustrated by the recent innovation of new hybrid fermentation tanks at Castello Banfi. Most winemakers are faced with a choice: ferment in wood for added richness and roundness, or use stainless steel for maximum freshness. Unwilling to sit back and accept the status quo, Mariani-May has been the guiding hand behind the development of new hybrid fermenters, comprising a unique combination of a steel base and head and a wood middle section. Seven years of trial and experiment preceded the launch of the new, patented 4,600 gallon tanks (1/3 steel, 2/3 wood), which combine the best of both materials, balancing the flavor and aeration supplied by oak with the temperature control, ease of use and hygiene offered by stainless steel. Inaugurated in September 2007, 24 composite fermenters at Castello Banfi are currently used in the production of the estate’s Brunellos, Tuscan cuvées and single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Marketing and promotion have always been strengths of the approachable and personable Mariani-May. In the course of her work Mariani-May travels extensively, visiting many of the 85 countries where Castello Banfi wines are sold. An engaging, charismatic speaker, she is a natural international ambassador for her family’s brand. Mariani-May’s goals also include transforming Montalcino into a destination for wine lovers and turning Castello Banfi into an international name in wine tourism. A project close to her heart is the supervision and development of Castello Banfi – Il Borgo, a 14-room luxury hotel nestled alongside the estate’s medieval castle walls. The hotel, which opened its doors to the public in 2007, represents the jewel in the crown of the Castello Banfi estate and a beacon of Tuscany hospitality. Mariani-May’s immediate family includes her husband, Marshall May, and their three young children. A hands-on mother, she divides her time between Montalcino and Long Island, NY, home to Banfi Vintners. An avid runner and swimmer, she freely admits that much of her best thinking comes during her early morning workouts. The virtues of self-discipline, determination and endurance demanded of a long-distance runner might equally well apply to a sustained and successful leadership role in business.

Margo Van Staaveren Winemaker & General Manager, Chateau St. Jean BIO × Margo Van Staaveren Margo Van Staaveren has celebrated more than 30 harvests at Chateau St. Jean. During her tenure with the winery, Margo has played a pivotal role in every facet of the winemaking process. As winemaker, she makes the final decisions involving blend and style to produce consistently high quality wines in the super premium and luxury category. That’s no small task considering Chateau St. Jean produces an extensive portfolio of Sonoma County wines as well as vineyard designated wines, limited-production Reserve wines, and the flagship Cinq Cépages Cabernet Sauvignon. Margo has been instrumental in the production of the Cinq Cépages since the premier 1990 vintage release. Margo is a firm believer that great wines are grown—a conviction she shares with the Chateau founders who led the way for Chateau St. Jean to become a pioneer of vineyard-designated wines in the early 1970s. To achieve Chateau St. Jean vineyard designation the grapes must consistently exhibit exceptional varietal character each year. The art of blending is the cornerstone of Margo’s winemaking philosophy. To her, one of the greatest accomplishments is to create a wine style or signature blend that carries from vintage to vintage while still capturing the uniqueness of that particular growing year. The Chateau St. Jean Sonoma County wines are appellation blends of a particular varietal. These wines give Margo the opportunity to blend together the distinct characteristics from each sub-appellation in an effort to make the best wine possible from that vintage. “I find that blended wines from the diverse Sonoma County region are even more explosive in their intensely forward fruit flavors,” Margo explains. One of the things she enjoys most about her job is putting together the final blend for the Reserve wines. “Since no two vintages are alike, it gives us the opportunity to carefully search for the vineyard lots that offer the biggest fruit expression and the ability to age in order to create a wine that truly captures the best of the vintage,” says Margo. The Reserve wines represent the most concentrated, distinctive and balanced wines made at Chateau St. Jean. Margo Van Staaveren graduated from the University of California at Davis in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science in Fermentation Science. Shortly after graduation, she joined Chateau St. Jean as a Laboratory Technician in 1980. By 1989, she had worked her way to being named Assistant Winemaker and later named Associate Winemaker. Margo was named Winemaker and General Manager for Chateau St. Jean in August of 2003, continuing a rich legacy of winemaking as the fourth winemaker in the winery’s history. In 2008 she was named “Winemaker of the Year” by Wine Enthusiast magazine.

Together with her brother Franco Allegrini, head winemaker for Allegrini Estates, Marilisa carries on the legacy of their father Giovanni, a visionary viticulturist in Valpolicella credited with revolutionizing Amarone and appassimento winemaking. Steeped in centuries of winegrowing expertise, the family is recognized for crafting the benchmark Amarone, pioneering a focus on single-vineyard sites, and consistently marrying tradition with innovation. Sharing the Legacy of Italian Wine with the World Marilisa was brought up in the vineyard by Giovanni, and was heavily influenced by his dedication to Italian winegrowing of the highest caliber. After studies at the University of Verona, Marilisa became Director of Sales and Marketing for Allegrini and began traveling throughout Italy and the world to share the story of her family’s heritage and wines. Her passion and ambassadorship helped cement the reputation of Amarone as one of the world’s finest wines and Allegrini as its top producer. Today, Marilisa is president of Amarone Families (Famiglie dell’Amarone d’Arte), and has been recognized as one of the top ambassadors for Valpolicella worldwide. Breaking new ground in Bolgheri. Bolgheri in Tuscany represented to Marilisa and the Allegrini family not only a beautiful new domain but also a promise to continue their exploration of what’s possible in Italian wine. So in 2002, Marilisa, Franco and their late brother Walter embarked on a new winegrowing journey in the region’s renowned coastal terroir, focused once again on the premise of developing extraordinary vineyard sites. The family’s Poggio al Tesoro estate and its wines have already received acclaim, thanks to the dedication, relentless pursuit of quality and respect for the land the family upholds in all of its endeavors. “Tradition is not immobility,” Marilisa says of the family’s Tuscan exploration. “When accompanied by true respect for a territory, there is always something to discover, to interpret, to see in a new light.” Celebrating Italian culture and hospitality. Marilisa and the Allegrini family channel their passion for hospitality at Verona’s Villa della Torre, their 16 th century renaissance palace, which was once home to visiting artists and bears a rich cultural past. Today, this world-class destination welcomes guests with the family’s phenomenal wines as well as dining experiences from a Michelin-starred chef. Every detail is thoughtfully anticipated, and the result is a distinctly Italian sense of welcome, grace and vivacity. “It is thrilling to us that the Villa della Torre’s façade, grand rooms, archways and gardens today recall their former 16th century grandeur—and thus reflect our commitment to honoring Italian culture,” says Marilisa. Whether she is sharing the story of Allegrini’s enduring success in the Veneto or introducing wines from the family’s latest chapter in Tuscany, Marilisa draws on her singular knowledge to inspire and inform.

Deborah Brenner Founder & CEO, Women of the Vine & Spirits and Diverse Powered Brands BIO × Deborah Brenner As a Social Entrepreneur, Deborah Brenner expounds beyond the entrepreneurial focus of growing a business and measures performance on the positive impact the business makes on society. She has manifested her vision with Women of the Vine & Spirits, and inspired people to support a movement in the alcohol beverage industry. She has presented a challenge that calls forth the best in people and brings them together around a shared sense of purpose, working with the power of intentionality and alignment with a higher purpose. Deborah Brenner graduated from the University of Delaware with degrees in English and Journalism, and was soon hired by a television and film technology company that required international travel to countries for whom wine is a part of everyday life. After over 20 years in the male-dominated field of high-end technology and owning a marketing and public relations firm, Deborah discovered during a fortuitous trip to Napa and Sonoma that many women in the wine industry – like her own – were under-recognized. Compelled to tell their stories, she authored a bestselling collection of profiles on women in the wine industry, Women of the Vine: Inside the World of Women Who Make, Taste and Enjoy Wine , which Wine Spectator named a Critical Read of 2007. Through the process of writing the book and championing its subjects, Deborah became inspired to enter the wine business herself, releasing wine from a first-of-its-kind collective of seven artisan women winemakers from Napa, Sonoma and Paso Robles. For the following seven years, Deborah learned the business inside and out. Ultimately, however, all the money, blood, sweat and (a lot) of tears could not foster women in the wine industry the way she had hoped, which led her to shut down the Women of the Vine wine brand and return to the drawing board. One year later, Deborah organized the inaugural Women of the Vine Global & Spirits Global Symposium, held in March of 2015, which quickly sold out to 500 women from five countries. Due to the overwhelming response, Deborah and the Women of the Vine & Spirits Advisory Board went to work developing a consortium that supports professionals in the alcohol beverage industry year-round. Thus, emerged Women of the Vine & Spirits, a membership-based organization, anchored by the annual Global Symposium, whose mission is to empower and equip women worldwide to advance their careers in the alcohol beverage industry, fostering gender diversity and talent development across the industry at large. Deborah belongs to the Culinary Institute of America’s Society of Fellows and has received a Rising Star Award from Women for WineSense (2008), a New York Small Business Administration Women in Business Champion Of The Year (2009), a New York City National Association of Women Business Owners Signature Award (2010), the Lillian Vernon Award for Outstanding Community Service by the Women's Enterprise Development Center (2011), a NY Women in Communications Rising Star Award (2013),  the Rockland Business Women's Network Woman of the Year Award (2014), the Rockland Business Women's Network Woman of the Year Award (2014), American Cancer Society Dr. Louis Berger Award (2017), Wine Enthusiast Wine Star Award Person of the Year Nominee (2017), Las Vegas Inc. “Woman to Watch” (2018), and Wine Enthusiast Wine Star Award “Social Visionary of the Year” Recipient (2018).

Brenae Royal Vineyard Manager, Monte Rosso Vineyard BIO × Brenae Royal Brenae Royal grew up in the town of Atwater, in California’s Central Valley. “I come from a family of teachers and doctors, so when I started raising pigs, my family thought, where did she fall off?” Brenae says, laughing. When asked about her first farming memories, she recalls picking weeds and planting flowers with her grandmother. “My grandmother has a ginormous garden.” As the Vineyard Manager for the 575-acre Monte Rosso Vineyard on the eastern hills of Sonoma Valley, one the most acclaimed winegrowing sites in California, Brenae might have her grandmother beat. Brenae put her passion to action at a young age, joining 4-H at 12 and becoming an officer in the Future Farmers of America when she was 17. The program took her all over California and immersed her in a world she knew she wanted to be a part of for the rest of her life. Brenae studied Crops and Horticulture Science at California State University, Chico and during her senior year, after developing a palate for bold red wines, decided to pursue a career in viticulture. She joined E. & J. Gallo Winery in 2013 as an Operations and Viticulture Intern and quickly established a relationship with an important mentor, winemaker Deborah Juergenson. “Deb started out as one of the first few women winemakers in a very male-dominated field. It’s been amazing to have her as a mentor, both professionally and personally,” Brenae says. “Viticulture is still very male-dominated, so to drive more inclusion and diversity is very much an uphill battle.” It’s a battle that Brenae has done anything but back down from. Since joining Gallo, Brenae has farmed Monte Rosso Vineyard with increasing levels of responsibility. In addition to her internship, Brenae also served as Viticulture Technician for 11 months before being named Vineyard Manager in 2015. Monte Rosso is home to some of the oldest producing grapevines in California and has garnered a near-mythic reputation among winemakers. “When I started, it was intimidating. Here I am as this 24-year-old coming to manage Monte Rosso, a world-renowned vineyard and one of the oldest in the state. It’s difficult and complex. Our vines range from four months old to over 130 years old, so it’s a lot to take on, but I love it,” she says. “We’ve brought a lot of technology and innovation to the vineyard, so much so that we can be farming up to three different wine styles within the same single block.” Mount Peak Winery, like Brenae, is singularly focused on expressing Monte Rosso’s uniqueness. “When our winemaker Mark Williams visits, it’s not uncommon to hop in my truck and then hike into his favorite blocks. It’s a hands-on approach to winemaking, and he’s very honored to work with the fruit.” When asked how Monte Rosso’s distinct terroir shows up in the bottle, Brenae quickly answers. “Acidity,” she declares, “and minerality and spice.” Part of the vineyard’s mystique is that its signature qualities seem impervious to producer and variety. “You can taste Monte Rosso wines blind and recognize them immediately,” she adds. Brenae is doing everything in her power to keep it that way. “My goal is always to preserve what is special about Monte Rosso,” she says. “Hopefully it will be producing for another 132 years.” Marbet Lewis Founding Partner and Managing Partner, Spiritus Law BIO × Marbet Lewis Marbet Lewis is a founding partner and managing partner at Spiritus Law.  She has focused her practice on the laws governing regulated products and the alcohol industry in the manufacture, importation, and sale of alcohol beverage products since 2004.

As a child, Danica Patrick tried a little bit of everything, from cheerleading to choir, T-ball, volleyball, basketball, track, tumbling and band. While she had a variety of interests, one thing stood out above the rest: her passion for racing. Patrick developed an interest in the sport after her parents bought her a go-kart when she was 10 years old. What began as a fun way for her family to spend more time together quickly blossomed into a career that would carry Patrick far from her childhood home in Roscoe, Illinois. After winning numerous regional and national go-kart titles, Patrick left the comfort of family and friends in the Midwest when she was just 16 years old to compete in the cutthroat world of European road racing. After racing at various levels in different racecars, Patrick burst onto the national scene in May 2005 when she stunned the world by leading 19 laps and finishing fourth in her first Indianapolis 500.

In February 2013, as Patrick transitioned to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, she made headlines around the world with her record-setting performance in the 55th Daytona 500 race at Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway. She became the first woman to win a NASCAR Cup Series pole when she set the fastest time in qualifying for the Daytona 500 and then finished in eighth place, the highest finishing position ever for a woman in the “Great American Race.” As Patrick’s NASCAR Cup Series career progressed, she continued to rewrite the history books. She broke the record for most top-10 finishes of any female in the NASCAR Cup Series in 2015 and holds the new mark with a total of seven top-10s to her credit. In May 2016, Danica became a three-time winner of the Monster Energy Fan Vote for the Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race. She is the lone repeat winner of the vote in the event’s history. In November 2017, Patrick announced that she would end her racing career with the “Danica Double” by competing in two marquee events that were cornerstones of her career: the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. As she closes out this part of her professional life, Patrick’s focus shifts to her next chapter as an entrepreneur and business owner. Patrick has already forged into new career territory. She launched a clothing line – Warrior by Danica Patrick – in 2017, authored the fitness book Pretty Intense and is the sole proprietor of a vineyard in California that produces Somnium Wine.

Cristina Mariani-May Co-Chief Executive Officer, Banfi Vintners BIO × Cristina Mariani-May CRISTINA MARIANI-MAY \"We are selling not just wine, but a way of life. It’s about something slower, calmer, more in touch with family.” -- Cristina Mariani-May Cristina Mariani-May is the family proprietor of the internationally renowned Castello Banfi vineyard estate in Montalcino, Tuscany, and co-CEO of Banfi Vintners, a leading U.S. importer of fine wines. The youngest daughter of Banfi Chairman Emeritus, John F. Mariani, Jr., Ms. Mariani-May, together with her cousin James Mariani, represents the third generation of family leadership in the company founded by their grandfather, John Mariani, Sr. in 1919. Soon after completing her studies at  Georgetown University and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business, Mariani-May joined Banfi in 1993. Among the first of many forward-thinking initiatives introduced by Mariani-May was the creation of progressive new tracking and monitoring systems at Castello Banfi, designed to elevate performance and establish new goals in the fields of customer satisfaction, environmental responsibility and social responsibility. In 2006 those procedures paid off when Castello Banfi became the only winery in the world to achieve ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and SA 8000 certification acknowledging leadership in these areas. This accomplishment underlines the strategic long-term vision, coupled with an ability to execute, that characterize her management of Castello Banfi. A “pursuit of excellence” serves as a personal mantra for Mariani-May. It extends to every aspect of her work, in particular her family’s wines and nowhere more so than with the Brunellos for which Castello Banfi is renowned. Alone among producers of Brunello di Montalcino wines, Castello Banfi has conducted ground-breaking research aimed at defining and isolating the finest clones of the Sangiovese Grosso grape. Initiated in the early 1980s, the project moved into high gear after Mariani-May joined the company. From an original catalog of over 600 types, 15  have since been determined to possess the greater part of the grape’s inherent characteristics. Today Banfi has definitive results for six clones and research continues on the remaining nine. And like any good neighbor, Banfi has shared those results, as well as registering them in 1996 with the European Community. Of Italy’s 45 nationally approved clones for Sangiovese, six are from Castello Banfi. Enterprise and readiness to experiment also factor into Mariani-May’s leadership, as illustrated by the recent innovation of new hybrid fermentation tanks at Castello Banfi. Most winemakers are faced with a choice: ferment in wood for added richness and roundness, or use stainless steel for maximum freshness. Unwilling to sit back and accept the status quo, Mariani-May has been the guiding hand behind the development of new hybrid fermenters, comprising a unique combination of a steel base and head and a wood middle section. Seven years of trial and experiment preceded the launch of the new, patented 4,600 gallon tanks (1/3 steel, 2/3 wood), which combine the best of both materials, balancing the flavor and aeration supplied by oak with the temperature control, ease of use and hygiene offered by stainless steel. Inaugurated in September 2007, 24 composite fermenters at Castello Banfi are currently used in the production of the estate’s Brunellos, Tuscan cuvées and single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Marketing and promotion have always been strengths of the approachable and personable Mariani-May. In the course of her work Mariani-May travels extensively, visiting many of the 85 countries where Castello Banfi wines are sold. An engaging, charismatic speaker, she is a natural international ambassador for her family’s brand. Mariani-May’s goals also include transforming Montalcino into a destination for wine lovers and turning Castello Banfi into an international name in wine tourism. A project close to her heart is the supervision and development of Castello Banfi – Il Borgo, a 14-room luxury hotel nestled alongside the estate’s medieval castle walls. The hotel, which opened its doors to the public in 2007, represents the jewel in the crown of the Castello Banfi estate and a beacon of Tuscany hospitality. Mariani-May’s immediate family includes her husband, Marshall May, and their three young children. A hands-on mother, she divides her time between Montalcino and Long Island, NY, home to Banfi Vintners. An avid runner and swimmer, she freely admits that much of her best thinking comes during her early morning workouts. The virtues of self-discipline, determination and endurance demanded of a long-distance runner might equally well apply to a sustained and successful leadership role in business.

Deborah Brenner Founder & CEO, Women of the Vine & Spirits BIO × Deborah Brenner Deborah Brenner graduated from the University of Delaware with degrees in English and Journalism, and was soon hired by a television and film technology company that required international travel to countries for whom wine is a part of everyday life. After over 20 years in the male-dominated field of high-end technology and owning a marketing and public relations firm, Ms. Brenner discovered during a fortuitous trip to Napa and Sonoma that many women in the wine industry – like her own – were under-recognized. Compelled to tell their stories, she authored a bestselling collection of profiles on women in the wine industry, Women of the Vine: Inside the World of Women Who Make, Taste and Enjoy Wine , which Wine Spectator named a Critical Read of 2007. Through the process of writing the book and championing its subjects, Ms. Brenner became inspired to enter the wine business herself, releasing wine from a first-of-its-kind collective of seven artisan women winemakers from Napa, Sonoma and Paso Robles. For the following seven years, Ms. Brenner learned the business inside and out. Ultimately, however, all the money, blood, sweat and (a lot) of tears could  not foster women in the wine industry the way Brenner had hoped, which led her to shut down the Women of the Vine wine brand and return to the drawing board. One year later, Brenner organized the inaugural Women of the Vine Global Symposium, held in March of 2015, which quickly sold out to 500 women from five countries. Due to the overwhelming response, Brenner and the Women of the Vine Advisory Board went to work developing a consortium that supports professionals in the alcohol beverage industry year-round. Thus emerged the Women of the Vine Alliance, a membership-based organization, anchored by the annual Symposium, whose mission is to empower and equip women worldwide to advance their careers in the alcohol beverage industry, fostering gender diversity and talent development across the industry at large. Ms. Brenner has received a Rising Star Award from Women for WineSense (2008), a New York Small Business Administration Women in Business Champion Of The Year (2009), a New York City National Association of Women Business Owners Signature Award (2010), the Lillian Vernon Award for Outstanding Community Service by the Women's Enterprise Development Center (2011), a NY Women in Communications Rising Star Award (2013), the Rockland Business Women's Network Woman of the Year Award (2014), American Cancer Society Dr. Louis Berger Award (2017), and Wine Enthusiast Wine Star Award Person of the Year Nominee (2017).

These two indulgences, when carefully selected, complement each other beautifully, enhancing flavors and providing a luxurious moment of relaxation. Whether you’re a seasoned aficionado or a newcomer to the world of cigars and fine wines, understanding their nuances will elevate your appreciation and selection process. Understanding Premium Cigars What Makes a Cigar Premium? A premium cigar is handcrafted from the finest tobacco leaves, often aged for several years to develop complex flavors. Unlike machine-made cigars, premium options do not contain additives or artificial flavoring. Cigar Shapes and Sizes: Finding Your Style Cigars come in different shapes and sizes, impacting the smoking experience: Parejos (Straight-sided cigars) – Includes Robusto, Churchill, and Lonsdale. Figurados (Shaped cigars) – Includes Torpedo, Perfecto, and Pyramid. Aging and Storing Premium Cigars Proper storage is crucial to maintain quality. A humidor keeps cigars at an optimal humidity (65-72%) and temperature (65-70°F) , ensuring flavors remain intact. At our cigar shop in Florida, we take great care to store our cigars in the best possible conditions. Florida’s naturally high humidity levels often range between 60-80%, which is already within the ideal range for cigar preservation. Because of this, we do not use additional humidification in our store, as excess moisture can lead to over-humidified cigars, which may burn unevenly or develop mold. However, we always recommend storing cigars in a properly maintained humidor at home, as air conditioning and environmental changes can impact their condition. What Defines a High-End Wine? The Impact of Terroir A wine’s quality depends on its terroir—the unique combination of soil, climate, and vineyard location that influences flavor and character. Best Wine Regions for Premium Selection Bordeaux (France) – Home to some of the world’s finest red blends. Napa Valley (USA) – Known for bold, high-quality Cabernet Sauvignon. Tuscany (Italy) – Famous for Sangiovese-based wines like Chianti and Brunello. Rioja (Spain) – Offers rich, oak-aged Tempranillo wines. Mendoza (Argentina) – A paradise for Malbec lovers. Pairing Cigars with Wine: A Refined Experience Best Cigar and Wine Pairings Full-bodied cigars pair well with bold reds like Cabernet Sauvignon. Mellow cigars match with aged whites such as Chardonnay. Sweet wines like Port complement dark, rich cigars beautifully. Tasting Techniques: How to Enjoy Cigars and Wines Together Cut and light the cigar properly to avoid bitterness. Sip wine slowly , allowing flavors to unfold. Pace yourself , alternating between cigar draws and wine sips. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How long do premium cigars last? When stored properly, they can last decades without losing flavor. What’s the best wine for a beginner? A smooth Merlot or Chardonnay is a great start. How do I store an expensive bottle of wine? Keep it in a wine cellar or temperature-controlled fridge . Conclusion Selecting the perfect premium cigar and high-end wine is an art that requires knowledge, patience, and experience. Whether you enjoy them individually or together, the right choices will elevate your appreciation and indulgence.
