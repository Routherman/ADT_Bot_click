What's the inclement weather policy At Nona Adventure Park, the safety of our guests is our top priority. We operate in all safe weather conditions and are committed to ensuring a fun and secure experience for everyone. Weather Interruptions: In the event of extreme winds or nearby lightning, certain park activities may be temporarily paused for safety. Our team continuously monitors weather conditions in real-time. Reopening Procedure: Attractions and rides will reopen as soon as conditions are deemed safe by our team. Updates will be communicated on-site and via our front desk. What shoes can I wear on the climbing tower? Closed toe laced sneakers are REQUIRED on the climbing tower. Is there a refund policy? Nona Adventure Park is an outdoor venue, and all park activities are subject to weather conditions. By purchasing admission, rentals, or event bookings, guests acknowledge and accept that outdoor operations may be temporarily interrupted or suspended due to inclement weather, including but not limited to lightning, high winds, heavy rain, or early park closure. General Policy As a general rule, Nona Adventure Park does not issue refunds for weather-related interruptions. However, for out-of-town guests, we offer the following structured exception: Full Refund: If the park is closed all day due to weather and no activities are available, guests will receive a full refund. 50% Refund: If weather results in less than 50% of the guest's scheduled activity time being available, a 50% refund may be issued. No Refund or Rain Check: If a guest chooses to leave before the midpoint of their scheduled visit, while the park remains open and is actively monitoring conditions to resume operations, no refund or rain check will be issued. We encourage all guests to remain on-site during temporary weather holds. Most interruptions are short-term, and our team is committed to resuming activities as soon as it is safe to do so. Leaving early does not entitle a guest to compensation unless the park is officially closed for the remainder of the day. To qualify for this exception, guests must: - Notify us at the time of booking that they are visiting from outside the local area. - Submit any refund request within 48 hours of their scheduled visit. Rain Checks Rain checks may be issued in other situations at the discretion of park management, subject to the following: Before Session Begins: If weather forces a closure before the start of a session, a rain check may be granted.
