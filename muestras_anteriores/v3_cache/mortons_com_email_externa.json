Learn More Student Success Stories My experience at Morton College taught me valuable skills that have helped me to provide services to the community and be the best healthcare provider I can be. I learned a lot in the physical therapist assistant program and have always felt supported by all the staff and faculty at Morton College. My education at Morton College has been invaluable and has ingrained confidence and strong leadership skills necessary for me to continue in my career. Michelle Diaz Associates in Applied Sciences Physical Therapist Assistant Class of 2019 Morton College has benefited me greatly through academics and athletics. Morton College prepared me to make the transition to the University of St. Francis and prepared me for life skills. If it wasn’t for the academic advisors, professors, athletic staff, coaches and student athletes who believed in me and helped me reach my goals and full potential, I wouldn’t be where I am today. Thank You Morton College! Matthew Shonder Associate in Arts Degree Class of 2019 As a first generation, undocumented student, college seemed so far fetched. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to succeed and would feel alone. However, my time at Morton College was one of the best of my lifetime. I met lifelong friends, connected with great mentors who genuinely cared about my success, discovered my passion for community and social justice. Attending Morton right out of high school was one of the best investments- time and money wise- I’ve ever made and would really encourage anyone to consider the value that community colleges hold. Morton College will always have a special place in my heart! Brenda Bedolla Associate of Arts Class of 2013 Since day one, Morton College offered me so many resources that helped me expand my education and leadership skills. Attending Morton College has been one of the best decisions I've made. All the staff and faculty I came across helped me one way or another so I can be able to find my passion and reach my goals. I am grateful for all opportunities and learning experiences I took with me. Morton College will always be a part of my success. Cristal Hernandez Associate in Arts Degree Class of 2020 Morton College is a great community college! As an international-student athlete Morton College provided a home away from home welcoming experience. The community of professional staff, support and my student athlete friendships are what made my experience most memorable. Morton College has absolutely everything you need but the most important part is to get out there and ask questions and ask for help. Stay humble and stay hungry. Patryk Kibler Associate in Science Class of 2020 When I first started at Morton College I was disappointed that I was not going to attend a four-year University as I had planned. With time I learned to love Morton College and appreciated the staff and faculty. My educational journey ended on a high note, Morton College really took care of me and my favorite part was enjoying all the free catered events hosted for students. The free breakfast and taquizas really hit the spot on finals week. Giselle Castaneda Associate in Arts Degree Class of 2019 Athletics JPAC Theatre Follow Us on Social 3801 S.
