But we can’t do it without YOU! History of the Pride Center On September 13th, 2000, the LGBTQ+ community came together and decided “the time is now” to establish a Community Center in North Central Florida. The community approved the bylaws, selected the name, and elected the first Board of Directors in February 2001. In April 2002, we opened the doors at our NW 6th St. Gainesville location. In October 2003, we expanded the facility and the hours of operation were increased from 4 to 6 days per week. In September 2007 the center moved into a larger facility at 3131 NW 13th St in Gainesville and services continued to expand. In January 2008 the center merged with Pride Celebration of Gainesville and began producing Gainesville Pride Days In 2013, with other groups, we helped pass the inclusion of LGBTQ+ protections in the Alachua County HRO. In 2015 we hosted the community celebrations when Florida and then the entire country achieved marriage equality. In 2018 we merged with the Gainesville Area AIDS Project and began providing direct services to people with HIV/AIDS. In 2019, we raised funds to pay for three rainbow crosswalks to be installed in downtown Gainesville through the city’s “Art in Crosswalks” program in time for National Coming Out Day in October.

Business/Organization Membership Levels Business/Organization Directory Donate Volunteer Programs Resources Audre Lorde Library Community Resources Online Health Resources Local Health Resources Transgender Resources State and National Resources Publications Pride Guide Calendar Programs Home Programs Gainesville Area AIDS Project (GAAP) The Gainesville Area AIDS Project (GAAP) is a vital program of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida, providing weekly lunches, personal hygiene products, and household supplies for our HIV/AIDS clients, who are often food- or housing-insecure. Services Distribution of food & essentials GAAP provides clients with a hot meal, fresh bread and pastries, and substantial bags of food from our food pantry, including dry, cold, and frozen foods on a weekly basis. Referrals are given for other HIV/AIDS healthcare and social services programs, as well. GAAP currently prepares and serves a to-go meal to 25-30 clients each Tuesday from 8:30am to 12pm at First United Methodist Church (419 NE 1st Street, Gainesville). Clients who feel well enough may enjoy the Tuesday meal as a sit-down lunch, an opportunity to socialize. GAAP also provides household cleaning supplies and toiletries that clients would not be able to obtain through SNAP or other publicly funded programs. On a rotating schedule, clients can pick up several months’ worth of these essentials during the Tuesday meal. Client enrollment Enrollment in our program is simple and is open to all people living with HIV/AIDS. Please bring your Letter of Eligibility or your case worker’s information to our distribution site at FUMC on Tuesdays between 8:30-11:30am. Please arrive at least 30 minutes prior to our noon closing time if you are a new client enrolling for the first time. On the first day of enrollment, clients will be provided with a hot meal, food pantry items, household cleaning supplies, and toiletries. History GAAP began in September of 1993 when about 25 Persons Living with AIDS (PLWAs), caregivers, and friends joined together to consider the unmet needs of PLWAs in the Gainesville area. Two factors quickly became apparent: people wanted a place where they could go for support and social activities, and they wanted to avoid the hassles of paperwork! By December of 1993, GAAP had begun a drop-in center at Trinity United Methodist Church, meeting on Tuesdays and Fridays, for brown bag lunches, games, and support from the “Mothers of GAAP”. In 2002, the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida (PCCNCF) invited GAAP to host its services at our center, and in 2018, GAAP became a program of PCCNCF. Due to PCCNCF’s move in the summer of 2023 to the Springhill area, we partnered with First United Methodist Church (FUMC) in downtown Gainesville to provide easier access for most of our clients, who often have limited transportation. FUMC also offers ample space to store the program’s pantry items, personal hygiene products, and household supplies, and to prepare and host the weekly lunches. We are thrilled that our new location in FUMC’s fellowship hall is bringing in new clients, increasing accessibility, and enabling us to reach new populations. How you can help Donate essential items Donations of the following new, unopened items may be dropped off at PCCNCF (3850 NW 83rd Street, 2nd Floor) Monday through Thursday from 9am to 8pm and Friday from 9am to 5pm. toilet paper laundry detergent bleach household cleaners dish detergent body wash deodorant shaving cream toothpaste toothbrushes razors menstrual products For any group interested in holding a drive to collect essentials, we will gladly provide bags with a list of all needed items. Please email your requested number of bags to gaap@gainesvillepride.org . Donate financially GAAP does not receive federal or state grants. We rely solely on the generosity of the community to be able to provide our services. All donations are tax-deductible. General GAAP donations Your donation will help increase our program’s outreach and support those living with HIV/AIDS: Expand the types and quantity of household and personal essentials provided Increase the number of clients served and the number of meals offered per week Provide outreach and program scope outside the Gainesville area into greater Alachua County and nearby rural counties Offer delivery options for homebound clients and those recently discharged from hospitalizations Purchase appropriate insulated food delivery containers to ensure meals are kept at required food-safe temperatures Reimburse volunteer drivers for mileage and gas Lunch sponsorship For $150, your donation will feed 30+ people!
