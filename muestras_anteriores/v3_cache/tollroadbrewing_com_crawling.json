JOIN NOW What Our Patrons Say \"We went here the first time on Saturday.  We just moved to the area and are getting acclimated to our new town.  We decided to stop by because we love beer and were excited to see a brewery.  We were greeted by a very nice server who asked if we wanted outdoor or indoor service.  We requested outdoor and were taken to an amazing rear patio area.  Plenty of seating, great atmosphere and the beer was good too. A little disappointed there wasn't any food but I am not sure of this is COVID related or they simply do not serve food.  The wait staff were all extremely friendly and we will definitely come back.\" Sam Newman - Local “Love King's Road! This is the first brewing company in Haddonfield and they have delicious beers on tap. Perfect spot for happy hour or to pick up a growler to go.” Ben H - Local \"This was our first visit to their new location. What a nice space! We tried three of their beers; Oktoberfest, Strata Sphere and El Dorado. All three were very enjoyable. Will definitely be back.\" Frank Clement - \"King's Road has been an incredible addition to the Haddonfield community - both in their original location and in their expanded new home.\" Timothy Koeth - Local \"A must stop if you're a beer lover. They always have a nice selection. The new location is beautiful with a large beer garden in the back.\" Laura Davidow - Local Nice brewery, with an old style ale house feel to it, with good beer and pleasant staff to boot. Located right in the heart of Haddonfield, I can't imagine it ever being uncrowded, but the folks in there aren't rowdy and getting served is a piece of cake.

A second brewery based in Ocoee is now coming to West Orange. Toll Road Brewing Company hopes to open their doors in mid-December. The brewery will be located on West McKey Street and operate Wednesday-Sunday. Toll Road Brewing Company’s three owners have 13 years of home-brewing experiences. They have used the last two years to fine-tune some of their favorite recipes and get feedback at beer festivals. The brewery is still in the build-out phase, but once completed, it should have a modern feel. Some of the design features include wooden accents and Edison bulb fixtures. There will also be windows in the taproom so customers can get a firsthand look at the brewing equipment in action. All beer, with the exception of ciders, will be brewed in-house. Some of the specific beers planned include a Citra Rye IPA, a pale ale and a peanut and chocolate porter. The Brewers’ plan is to have five or six core beers and rotate out three to four other experimental beers. The owners crafted the name of Toll Road Brewing company based on the fact that the 408, 429 and Florida’s turnpike all have Ocoee exits. They are just the latest in a wave of projects to come to the city’s downtown.

Pretty Welcoming... if we say so ourselves! We are getting ready! We needed to send over some pictures of the taproom to the LCB... Here is a sneak-preview with all \r\n                the nice cushions all in place and all the sawdust cleaned up. SOOO VERY CLOSE! Raise a Toast! The glasses arrived May 15, 2025. I could not resist taking a glamour shot in the beer garden. It was a nice day, and the hops was all green \r\n                and made a prefect background for the set. And before you all go asking, yes, we will have them for sale. Beer in the Back We also needed to show the beer garden for the LCB. Once we finished setting it up, we wanted to sit out there ourselves! HA! Top WAITING ON LICENSING Our Portfolio ! Toll Bridge's products are high quality, easy-drinking, and âFiendishly Good.â Our initial product\r\n          portfolio contains approximately fourteen (14) products, with the main focus on our Belgian styles. We are\r\n          currently developing a small portfolio of unique beers containing bread with freshly milled flours, our homage\r\n          to the importance of bread as both foodstuff and ancient brewing ingredient. We are also developing several non-alcoholic beverages as well for our non-drinking friends. Goldiélach Belgian-style Blond Belgian-style blonde ale with a low but pleasing hop bitterness and low malt aroma that has a spiced and\r\n            sometimes fruity ester character. It is medium in sweetness and not as bitter as its sibling. It is balanced\r\n            between light sweetness, spice, and low to medium fruity ester flavors. 7.0% ABV • 28 IBU Six Voies Abbey-style Single Abbey-style single. Its name is French, meaning âsix lanes.â The beer is a slightly sweet blonde ale, with\r\n            the typical fruitiness of Belgian yeast. Not-so-typical (but not IPA) hoppiness finishes this refreshingly\r\n            bright\r\n            Belgian-inspired Abbey-style single. 6.0% ABV • 40 IBU Dubbel Trubbel Belgian-style Dubbel with Bread Belgian-style dubbel with a malty sweetness and cocoa and caramel aromas and flavors. Its hop bitterness\r\n            is medium-low to medium. Yeast-generated fruity esters (especially banana) are balanced by extended lagering\r\n            times. Bread using freshly milled heirloom wheat contributes a unique spicy character and a smoother\r\n            mouthfeel. 8.3% ABV • 26 IBU Toll Bridge Brewing Tripel Belgian-style Tripel Belgian-style tripel with a mild spicy flavor and a yeast-driven complexity. This one is on the higher end\r\n            of the ABV spectrum, yet is very approachable to many different palates. 9.2% ABV • 39 IBU Biere de Saison l'Apricot Saison with Apricot [seasonal] Belgian-style saison with some yeast character and high carbonation, a slight Brettanomyces/lactic\r\n            character, and fruity aromas and flavors. Apricot puree is added to enhance the fruity characteristics of\r\n            the yeast. 5.8% ABV • 22 IBU Teuflisch Belgian-style Golden Strong Ale Belgian-style golden strong ale, the pilsner of Belgium. It has the\r\n            traditional characteristic spiciness from the Belgian yeast and a highly attenuated, dry finish. 9.5% ABV • 26 IBU Archangel Belgian-inspired IPA \"Belgian\" IPA with a heavenly taste, slightly aromatic and refreshingly fruity due to the use of four hop\r\n            varieties. The yeast lends a nice spiciness reminiscent of our Teuflisch Golden Strong Ale. 7% ABV • 61 IBU Jimmy Classic American Pilsner A delicious historical reproduction of the Classic American Pilsner, this pilsner has a beautiful, full,\r\n            golden color and a long-lasting, thick, creamy head. Its full flavor, with modest maltiness, is bolstered by\r\n            the subtle sweetness of corn. The beer's yeast character is balanced by a well-defined hop bitterness. It\r\n            has a\r\n            long, clean, subtly bitter finish. 5.5% ABV • 42 IBU Porter / Pumpernickel Porter Seasonal Porters A robust porter featuring a bitter and roasted malt flavor reminiscent of cocoa.\r\n            Its caramel and malty sweetness balances with the sharp bitterness of black malt. The hop\r\n            bitterness is evident and some diacetyl is present at very low levels. The twist? A seasonal âPumpernickel\r\n            Porterâ brewed with a Bavarian-style 100% rye bread made from freshly milled grain. 6.2% ABV • 40 IBU R'eyePA Flagship Rye IPA A Rye IPA, this beer is decidedly hoppy without being overly bitter. This is definitely a true Northwest\r\n            IPA with the addition of a significant amount of rye malt.\r\n            The balance is hop-forward, with a clean fermentation profile, dry finish, and clean, supporting malt\r\n            flavors, allowing a creative range of hop character to shine through. It is drier and spicier than\r\n            typical IPAs. 7.5% ABV • 88 IBU Hawai'IPA West Coast IPA Inspired by a brewery in Waimea, HI, and Kirkland, WA, this traditional West Coast IPA is characterized by\r\n            a\r\n            balanced floral, fruity hop character. The IPA is all about hop flavor, aroma and a moderate bitterness. 7.6% ABV • 67 IBU Schwarzbier German-Style Black Lager German-style Schwarzbier, or black lager. It is drier, darker and more roast-oriented than the dubbel. It\r\n            has a nice, surprisingly pale-colored foam head and a mild\r\n            roasted malt character without the associated bitterness. Its malt flavor and aroma is at low to medium\r\n            levels of sweetness. 4.5% ABV • 40 IBU Maibock Seasonal Also called a âhellerbockâ (meaning âlighter bockâ), this German-style Maibock\r\n            has a dominant malt-rich profile with lightly toasted and bready malt\r\n            character with a pleasant caramel finish. Watch for our roasted habanero-infused seasonal! 8.0% ABV • 41 IBU Eigenbier Scottish-style Wee-Heavy [seasonal] Strong Scotch Ale with fruity, malty aromas leading to plummy vanilla flavors,\r\n            finishing with a touch of oaky earthiness which nicely balances the dark malt nuttiness. One sip and you\r\n            will not want to share it! 9.0% ABV • 38 IBU Ginger Ale Flight or Pint This ginger ale \"flight\" features three different ginger syrups: fresh ginger, fresh galangal, and a\r\n            house blend. Blend your own or have a pint of the house blend. NON-AL Cream Ale Housemade Cream Soda One of our special housemade sodas, the first of many planned. NON-AL LETS GET IN TOUCH!
