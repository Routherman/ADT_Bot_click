The Flack family, who owned the club for over 20 years, selected Heritage as the buyer. This acquisition marks Heritage’s fourth property in the Greater Denver area, further strengthening its presence in Colorado. The other three properties in the area are The Golf Club at Bear Dance, Plum Creek Golf Club, and Colorado National Golf Club. “We’re excited to expand our presence in the Greater Denver area with the addition of Ptarmigan Country Club. Featuring a Jack Nicklaus Signature Course, this exceptional property enhances our growing portfolio,” said Scott McMartin, Chief Acquisitions Officer at Heritage Golf Group. “The Flack family has built an outstanding legacy over the past 20-plus years, and we are honoured to carry it forward and build upon their foundation.” Ptarmigan Country Club is a private, full-service golf and country club featuring a Jack Nicklaus Signature 18-hole golf course. Designed in 1979 to accentuate the dramatic Rocky Mountain landscape, the course offers a variety of challenges for golfers of all skill levels, with four sets of tee boxes, rolling topography, and 100 feet of elevation change. Other amenities include a two-level clubhouse with multiple dining areas, private event spaces, a fireside bar and lounge, an outdoor patio, and Men’s and Women’s locker rooms. Members also enjoy racquet sports such as pickleball and tennis, as well as a swimming pool. “It has been a pleasure working with Heritage Golf Group on the purchase of Ptarmigan Country Club. Heritage brings invaluable knowledge and resources that will further elevate this outstanding club. I’m excited to see the continued growth and success of the Ptarmigan family culture in the years ahead,” said Ryan Flack, previous owner of Ptarmigan Country Club. The Heritage team, with extensive proficiency in golf club operations, continues to elevate the member experience through transforming and improving amenities, operations, and programming at recently acquired clubs. The expanding network further enhances the value of Heritage Golf Group membership through the Heritage Plus Network — a reciprocal travel benefit that grants golf members access to other participating Heritage clubs.
