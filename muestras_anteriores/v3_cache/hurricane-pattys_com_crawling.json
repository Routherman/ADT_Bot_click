Shrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home. Hurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”. Here at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer award-winning cocktails , like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time. Join us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off. Oh! And, we hope you’re not afraid of ghosts—cause we’ve got one. Rumor has it, our restaurant is haunted. She’s a heartbroken woman still pining for her lover who never returned from sea. Can you hear her crying? Stop by and you may feel her sadness or even hear her slam the bathroom door...!

Inconsistencies may occur. ✖ The chances of would-be Storm Patty turning into a tropical event have increased in the last 24 hours. Since October 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has been monitoring an area in the southwestern Caribbean Sea for potential tropical development. The NHC said there is now a 60 percent chance the storm will develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming seven days— up from 50 percent in yesterday's update . The odds of the storm intensifying in the next 48 hours remains low for now at 30 percent, as per a 2:00 a.m. ET update. More From Newsweek Vault: 5 Steps to Build an Emergency Fund Today A tropical cyclone describes any storm above tropical depression strength, including tropical storms and hurricanes. For now, forecasters think there will be a tropical depression, with plenty of rainfall over Central American countries like Nicaragua and Honduras. \"A broad area of low pressure is likely to develop over the southwestern Caribbean Sea during the next day or so,\" the forecaster said. \"Gradual development is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression could form late this weekend or early next week while the system drifts generally northward or northwestward over the central or western Caribbean Sea.\" Seven-day tropical weather outlook from the National Hurricane Center. It has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm over the next seven days. Seven-day tropical weather outlook from the National Hurricane Center. It has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm over the next seven days. NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER Brian Tang, associate professor of atmospheric science at New York University, told Newsweek the storm doesn't appear to have the makings of a tropical cyclone at present. More From Newsweek Vault: Online Banks vs. Traditional Banks: Learn the Differences \"Thunderstorms associated with the tropical disturbance would need to consolidate more around the center of the disturbance,\" he said. \"A closed circulation would also need to form around the center. Once that happens, the tropical disturbance could further intensify into a tropical storm or hurricane.\" The NHC said that regardless of the extent of its development, for now local heavy rains \"are possible over portions of the adjacent land areas of the western Caribbean.\" Weather Channel meteorologist Danielle Banks said it is possible a \"tropical depression could form\" over the coming weekend or in the early part of next week as the system continues to travel north toward Cancun and western Cuba. She said the storm is \"definitely a concern\" as heavy rains \"could cause flooding in parts of Central America.\" More From Newsweek Vault: What Is an Emergency Fund? However, the NHC said on X, formerly Twitter , that the storm poses no threat to the U.S. within the seven-day period following October 28. There are two other areas currently under observation by NHC meteorologists, one in the northeastern Caribbean Sea and another in the North Atlantic Ocean. Both have low chances of development at this stage, ranging from 10 to 20 percent as of the 2:00 a.m. NHC update. In total, 15 named storms have formed throughout the current hurricane season, including 10 hurricanes. Five hurricanes have made landfall in the U.S.: Beryl, Francine, Debby, Helene and Milton.

Inconsistencies may occur. ✖ As the 2024 hurricane season draws to a close, one last storm might be growing in the Caribbean. The area of low pressure, located south of Cuba, currently has a 50 percent chance of reaching tropical cyclone strength in the coming seven days, according to National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts. This is an increase from the 40 percent likelihood at which the weather system has been classified all week, having increased from 30 percent on Sunday afternoon.

The Caribbean storm has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next seven days. More National Hurricane Center NHC / CSU/CIRA & NOAA Hurricane Patty tracker: Where is the storm headed? \"A broad area of low pressure is likely to develop over the southwestern Caribbean Sea during the next couple of days. Gradual development is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression could form over the weekend or early next week while the system drifts generally northward or northwestward over the central or western Caribbean Sea,\" the NHC said in a Tropical Weather Outlook. More From Newsweek Vault: Online Banks vs. Traditional Banks: Learn the Differences Tropical cyclone is a catch-all term for any storm at or above tropical depression strength, including tropical storms and hurricanes. When a storm reaches a sustained wind speed of up to 38 mph, it is classified as a tropical depression. At this point, the system is usually well-defined with organized thunderstorms, but lacks the high intensity of a stronger storm. If winds reach between 39 and 73 mph, it becomes a tropical storm, characterized by more intense organization, heavy rainfall, and strong winds, and is officially named. More From Newsweek Vault: What Is an Emergency Fund? At 74 mph or more, a storm is classified as a hurricane, which are rated from Category 1 to Category 5 based on their wind speeds. If this brewing storm in the Caribbean does eventually reach tropical storm strength, it would be named Tropical Storm Patty , and would be the 16th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. In the wake of Category 5 Hurricane Kristy, there are also two storms potentially forming in the Pacific, but these are less likely to achieve tropical cyclone strength than the Caribbean system. This 3-day #AirMass imagery from @NOAA ’s #GOESWest satellite shows #HurricaneKristy weaken and dissipate from a powerful hurricane in the Eastern Pacific. #TimelapseTuesday pic.twitter.com/AvS7GDwhqL — NOAA Satellites (@NOAASatellites) October 29, 2024 One of the systems is located in the Central East Pacific, and has a 10 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, and a 20 percent chance over the next 7 days. The NHC said: \"An area of low pressure located about 1,200 miles southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula continues to produce a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible during the next few days while the low moves slowly to the west-northwest. By the weekend, upper-level winds should become less conducive for development.\" The second potential storm, situated in the western East Pacific, is still just about going, with a near zero-percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone. \"A broad area of low pressure located about 1,800 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing limited showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are becoming increasingly unfavorable, and development is no longer anticipated,\" the NHC said. Where are the storms over the Atlantic? There are two other storms possibly growing in the Atlantic, one in the Northern Atlantic and another to the north of Puerto Rico. The North Atlantic system and the new Caribbean system both have a 10 percent chance of reaching tropical cyclone strength in the next 48 hours and also the next 7 days. Nov 1 8AM EDT: We continue to monitor multiple areas for tropical development. In particular an area in the SW Caribbean has a high (70%) chance of development, a broad area of low pressure is expected to develop and a tropical depression is likely to form late this weekend or… pic.twitter.com/LAcY7ybQz8 — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) November 1, 2024 When does hurricane season end? The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, while the Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 to November 30 in the Eastern Pacific and from June 1 to November 30 in the Central Pacific.
