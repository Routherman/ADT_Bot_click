Investing involves risk including loss of principal. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives. Some Funds may use leverage. If the securities decrease in value, a Fund that uses leverage may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. To the extent any Fund engages in short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. With the exception of the Wedgewood Fund and the RiverPark Floating Rate CMBS Fund, each Fund is \"diversified\", as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, default risk, and interest rate risk and may decline in value as interest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information may be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be obtained by clicking here or calling 1-888-564-4517.

Since then we’ve grown into a global movement, partnering with numerous park conservancies and completing countless park projects with habitat restoration emerging as our signature endeavor. Our vision is to live in harmony with our environments and create a world where we heal the parks and the parks also heal us in return. By Co-founder Keith Eshelman Read Full Story • 10 min read __________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________ Our Story From the Beginning 2014 - Parks Project is born Giveback: $1,209 During our time volunteering in the Santa Monica Mountains, we learned that environmental damage and a lack of funding had brought our parklands to the brink of crisis. Like in any tough situation, we decided to look for the helpers. What we found were unique projects that needed funding, tireless volunteers that needed support, and a global community of nature-lovers just waiting for a call to action. Out of our love for the Parks and our desire to see them flourish, Parks Project was born. 2015 - Parks Project gets rolling Giveback: $80,158 Operating out of garages, cars, and coffee shops, we made it to our first trade show, where we were lucky enough to be placed next to the coffee cart – people waiting in the line were forced to learn about us! 2016 - We buddy up with parks Giveback: $175,522 We became an official partner to the National Parks, hired four staff members, and built out all of the things we suddenly needed – accounting, HR, shipping, and all that fun stuff. 2017 - The team grows Giveback: $262,907 Our team expanded to a whopping nine people, which meant it was finally time for an office! Those new hires helped us build out our website, attract 100,000 Instagram followers, and all of the sudden, we couldn’t seem to keep our items on the shelf. 2018 - We partner with National Geographic and REI Giveback: $579,734 The momentum from the year before took us to a new level in 2018, thanks in part to awesome partnerships with National Geographic and REI. Two more team members meant we were on the move again, and with more focus on our online sales, we were able to give back over $500,000 to the parks – 100x what we gave back just three years before. 2019 - The Volunteer Alliance is born Giveback: $931,208 We didn’t rest on our laurels – we asked what more we could do. 2019 saw us launch our Volunteer Alliance to connect leaders and volunteers to host work days all over the country. We also started doing company volunteer trips to do more work ourselves, reconsidered our role and started focusing more on park news and stories, and launched awesome collaborations with Greta Van Fleet, Shepard Fairey, and much more! 2020 - Parks For All Giveback: $1,381,804 Like it was for so many people and companies, 2020 was a complicated one here at Parks Project. We left our office when the pandemic began and started working from home. For a team that so valued each other’s company, it was tough at first though it opened the opportunity to welcome new employees from all over the country to our team. In August, we surpassed our first million dollars donated to parks; before the end of the year, we added over $380,000 more to that contribution. 2021 - Our Year of Growth Giveback: $2,241,488 2021 was a milestone year at Parks Project. A little over a year after we celebrated $1,000,000 contributed to nonprofits on behalf of parks, we hit the $2,000,000 contributed mark! We also introduced a new collection of products designed for better enjoyment of the outdoors, including camp chairs and hammocks in three iconic all-over prints. We continued to collaborate with artists and lifestyle brands inspired by our mission. We reinstated the Volunteer Alliance and hosted clean-up programs from Los Angeles to New York. Finally, our team grew to 22 employees located across the country. 2022 - Partnerships and Clean Ups Giveback: $2,559,209 Did you know that our (and maybe your!) favorite Parks Project trail crew socks are now organic? More organic outcomes from 2022 include collabs with essential organizations like Outdoor Afro and the SF Park Alliance, and celebrating major moments like Yellowstone’s 150th anniversary as a national park. The team also volunteered at the annual Yosemite Facelift event - open to everyone! - and helped out in LA with the Tree People Coldwater Canyon cleanup. Thanks for being part of the Parks Project journey and helping us donate $2,559,209 back to the parks to leave it better than we found it. 2023 - Certifications & Sustainability Giveback: $2,620,578 Walking the park-championing walk is important for us as both a company and individuals at Parks Project, which is why achieving the B Corp Certification at the start of the year was a big deal. You can read more about what it means here. That set the tone for as we continued to roll out new collaborations with the Hawaiʻi Pacific Parks Association and feedback-based updates to some classics - like our boxy tees. Heading into our company retreat, we took a few days offline to bask in the sun at Sequoia National Park while helping to remove the invasive orchard grass that has taken root in Round Meadow. What’s next? Think more nature cleanup days with friends, more park partnerships, and bigger giveback goals to help preserve the places we love to wander. 2024 - Today Giveback: $2,742,706 It takes a community to make a difference, and as we reflect on 2024, we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished together—from clearing trails to nurturing young native plants. Looking ahead to 2025, we’re excited to invite you to set Leave It Better™ resolutions—small actions that make a big difference in protecting nature’s wild beauty. No matter how big or how small, together, we can make an impact for future park champions. 2024 at a glance: Removed 16,588 lbs of invasives. Maintained 2,500 feet of trail. Logged 956 volunteer hours. Hosted 16 volunteer days. Worked with 431 volunteers. Planted 1,850 native plants. Habitat & Wildlife Restoration National park ecosystems are often fragile and rely on diverse wildlife and native plants. Due to human impact, they are threatened in many of your parklands. Restoration projects help to undo past damage and prevent more from occurring in the future. Visitor Programs As visitation continues to grow in national parks around the country, it can take a toll on park infrastructure. Visitor programs are crucial for helping people experience and connect with the parklands in a non-invasive and sustainable manner. Advocacy & Education We aim to teach the world, whether local or international, about the importance of protecting parklands around the country. We think it's our responsibility to educate about parks and consistently advocate on their behalf—leading to a better future. Youth Initiatives Voices of the youth will impact the future of our parklands. Educating and inspiring the next generation of national park visitors, advocates, and guardians is crucial. Our goal is to give as many kids national park access as possible. Volunteering We live by our mission—putting people in parks to actively participate in projects is a year-round focus point. Whether it’s events in our backyard of the Santa Monica Mountains or across the country, we provide opportunities and support the efforts of people working to leave it better than they found it.
