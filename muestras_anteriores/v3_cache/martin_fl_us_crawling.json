Prev Next Martin County Fire Rescue By: Aja Dorsainvil Posted MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — An early morning fire has damaged a pavilion at Indian Riverside Park, Martin County Fire Rescue said. Crews said they responded to the fire just after midnight Monday at 1707 NE Indian River Drive in Jensen Beach. The fire appears to have started from an air handler in the attic, Martin County Fire Rescue said. Thankfully, sprinklers kept the blaze in check. However, there was major water damage throughout both floors. It’s unclear at this point when the pavilion will be able to reopen, crews said. Fire rescue said Martin County Parks and Recreation staff is currently contacting individuals based on the date of rental.

As you enter the park, you will notice the sculpture fountain of mother and calf dolphins leaping. The statue is by Geoffrey C. Smith and is called Life’s Journey. Walking Paths & Boardwalks Take a stroll along the 3/4-mile scenic walking path, which is popular with local residents. The pathway leads around a lake and down a hill to the river. The entire walk is lovely, as you pass many water birds that call the lake home. There is shade and benches to rest and watch the wildlife. White Ibis Egyptian Geese Family The river boardwalk is the nicest part- you walk elevated, looking out on the Indian River Lagoon. It makes an excellent location to view the sunrise over the Indian River Lagoon. Sunrise over the Lagoon The Mangrove Boardwalk starts in the rear of Captain Sewall’s house and extends for about a quarter of a mile into the mangroves. The walk leads you to a chick-ee hut at the end of the boardwalk. Look into the brackish water as you walk along to see fish, turtles, and wildlife. Mangroves help stabilize the coastline ecosystem and prevent erosion. Mangroves also provide natural infrastructure and protection to nearby populated areas by preventing erosion and absorbing storm surge impacts during extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Mangrove Boardwalk Fishing Indian Riverside Park has a 780-foot fishing pier where you can try your luck at catching a number of species, including snook, redfish, flounder, and pompano. Fish cleaning stations are installed on the pier. 780 Ft. Fishing Pier Beach A small beach access along the river is perfect for catching the sun or building a sandcastle. If you need a break from the sun, a nearby shade tree offers some relief. I nteractive Fountain Pack the kids and a picnic, bring some towels, and let them splash around in the fountain. It is the perfect thing to do on a hot summer day. Cooling off has never been so fun! The colorful interactive fountain at Indian RiverSide Park is open 7 days a week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Interactive Fountain The Francis Langford Dockside Pavilion If you are looking for the perfect place for special events, the two-story Frances Langford Dockside Pavilion could be your answer. The Pavilion has an air-conditioned banquet space, a kitchen, and a wrap-around balcony overlooking the Indian River Lagoon. More than 3800 square feet of space is available for birthday parties, weddings, reunions, and community events. Francis Langford was a resident of Jensen Beach. She was a singer and entertainer for more than two decades. She also made films and entertained the troops with Bob Hope. Francis Langford Dockside Pavilion T he Mansion at Tuckahoe For a more elegant setting, the Mansion at Tuckahoe offers waterfront views of the lagoon and includes some history. This historic site was once the home of a Coca-Cola heiress. This restored facility is a premier event venue and is available for weddings and special events. The Mansion at Tuckahoe Historic Captain Henry Sewall’s House This historic wooden Captain Henry Sewall’s House was built in 1889 and was home to local pioneer and developer Henry E. Sewall. The first Sewall’s Point post office was established in this home in 1891. It has had several owners throughout its history, including a bootlegger and a Naval officer during World War II. The last private owner offered the house to Martin County for preservation in 2006. It was moved and restored by 2012. It’s on the Martin County Register of Historic Landmarks. Treasure Coast Children’s Museum Indian Riverside Park is also home to the Treasure Coast Children’s Museum . The Children’s Museum of the Treasure Coast offers children and families a hands-on experience with educational programs, cultural experiences, and interactive activities. Children can pretend they are shopping in a grocery store or a firefighter, a train engineer, a doctor, a dentist, or a veterinarian. Children can see how the bones in their bodies move when they ride bicycles. To cap it all off, they have a pirate ship with shooting cannons. There is a wide range of parks located in Martin County. From the Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Hobe Sound to smaller parks such as Shepard’s Park in Stuart. Most promise relaxation and being as one with nature. Martin County is home to beaches, rivers, and natural habitats. Take some time and get out and enjoy nature. The Indian Riverside Park is at 707 NE Indian River Dr in Jensen Beach.
