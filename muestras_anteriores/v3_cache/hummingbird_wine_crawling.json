      "text": "Hummingbird Wine Bar brings new wine club, variety to Midtown News Sports Entertainment Opinion Email Us Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals MONEY Hummingbird Wine Bar brings new wine club, variety to Midtown TaMaryn Waters Tallahassee Democrat The opening for a new wine bar didn't go quite as planned, largely thanks to the pandemic of a century. However, even without a debut, wine at the Hummingbird Wine Bar is still flowing — just in its members' homes. The new Midtown attraction features a Wine Club where members sip selections that reach beyond readily available options in grocery stores, owner Greg Hajcak says. His vision is to create a cultural home for residents to appreciate and explore a range of wines. The Hummingbird will offer guided and blind tastings, among other things. Also, on the menu will be beer, cheese boards, salads and paninis. Hajcak says he'll work with guest chefs from local restaurants. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. It's located at 1216-4 N. Monroe St., in the same row of shops as Bruegger's Bagels. Hajcak says the grand opening date hasn’t been set. The tentative plan is to shoot for a gradual opening with members only and events, such as guided tastings, that can take place on the patio. That step could take place in late June or mid-July. Reduced seating inside could follow. However, the Wine Club, a member-based feature of the business, was part of the original plan and kicked off in May with about 55 members. This month, Hajcak says the Wine Club is projected to have about 80 members. “I think the reception has been super positive. We’ve had zero people drop out, which is amazing,” Hajcak said. “We’re pretty confident that people are excited about it and enjoying the wines that we are picking out for them.” He said the wine list is curated to be “exciting wines” some offerings on the wine rack could land in the “weird” category. Natural wines, for example, are growing in popularity in big cities and can be “a bit funkier than what people are used to,” Hajcak said. “Some of them can almost taste a little more like a sour beer,” he explained. “Another way that we mean that there is a lot of really amazing wine out there and different varietals than people are used to seeing in the grocery store that are fantastic.” Other offerings include a Pinot Grigio from Slovenia that fits the realm of orange wines, Hajcak said, adding orange wines are increasingly popular.  Another offering, a rose from Spain (100% Grenache), \"will knock your socks off,\" he said. Hajcak continued his wine tour with a mention of a Picpoul De Pinet from France (the Picpoul grape is lesser-known, but a very old French varietal). He said it would appeal to those who like a \"zippy fresh white wines with minerality, like an Albarino.\" \"In addition, we're bringing our members some really unique reds,\" he added. \"For instance, from Oregon, we're going to feature a 100% Gamay, and another that is 100% Graciano. \"These are both more typically 'old world' grapes that feature in French and Spanish wines, respectively, but are doing really well in hands of some outstanding wine makers in the Pacific Northwest. We're also delivering some classics, including a Nebbiolo from Italy and a Shiraz from Australia.\" Contact TaMaryn Waters at tlwaters@tallahassee.com or follow @TaMarynWaters on Twitter.

Is there a minimum month of commitment for a Hummingbird Wine Club membership? No, We want you to love it, if you don’t or if life changes, you can cancel at any time. The best way to cancel is to email or call us. We asked for a 48 notice prior to your billing date. When and where do I pick up my wines? All wine clubs are ready for pick up at the Hummingbird Wine Bar and Market, the third weke of each month. Our team will send you an email and reminder prior to pickup. Please bring your reusable bag each time. Do I automatically get charged every month (even if I don’t pick up)? Yes. Our system automatically charges every month on your renewal date. We may pause your subscription if your club is not picked up after 2 months and we cannot get in touch with you. Can I pause my subscription? Yes, you can pause each month. To reactivate simply email us. While your subscription is paused, you will not be eligible for wine club benefits such as discounts and exclusive events. What if I like a wine  in the club pack? Can I buy more of it? Well, some of our wine club wines are very limited so we may not have extra for sale, but if we do of course. Just ask. And remember as a wine club member you always receive 10% off on all wines. Is there a cutoff to purchase subscriptions for each month’s offerings? Yes, yes there is. Since we have to go and do the digging, the procuring, the packaging, and the rest of the humming birding, we need to have all subscription orders in prior to the 10th of each month. So, if you stumble across Hummingbird and order your subscription after the 10th of a particular month, you will be enrolled for the following month’s subscription box. Your initial payment will go towards the following month’s offerings and each subsequent charge will follow suit. What happens if I can’t pick up my wine? Members have 60 days from the start of pickups to get their wine. After 60 days they forfeit their ownership of the box. Members are not eligible for a refund on forfeited boxes. How do I cancel my membership? We’d be so sad to see you go, but if you must, memberships can be cancelled online or you can contact us at info@roundtowncollaborations or 770-703-2320.  Your membership must be cancelled 48 hours prior to the date of your recurring payment.
