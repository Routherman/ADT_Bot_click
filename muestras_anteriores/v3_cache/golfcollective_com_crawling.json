About Maxim Golf ABOUT MAXIM GOLF Our Story Maxim Golf Solutions was formed in 2011 by Bryan Minnis when several of his contemporaries in the Kansas City golf market sought his assistance to help increase their properties’ golf participation  At the time, Bryan served as the Director of Operations for Alvamar Country Club, a 36-hole Semi-Private operation located in Lawrence, KS. Bryan’s historical tenure as a golf and recreation operator was focused on all areas of club management with an emphasis in Sales and Marketing.  His work experience as a private and public golf club and recreation operator allowed him to better understand the importance of promoting club opportunities to the general public. Maxim’s first initiative was to create a membership experience that brought together several prominent daily fee golf properties in Kansas City. This process formed a membership program called “The Club Membership” which allowed members to join several clubs in the area through ONE membership program that shared the revenue of the membership sales across all participating properties. The strategy was a massive success, garnering thousands of members and achieving the goal of increased revenues and market share for the select number of participating clubs.  Soon after, Maxim Golf expanded the Club Membership to the Des Moines and St. Louis markets, thus growing the awareness of Maxim Golf’s potential to make positive impacts throughout multiple markets. Not long after, Maxim’s leadership was being sought after to help improve other areas of club operations and Maxim Golf Management was formed. Since that time, Maxim Golf has been involved in consulting, managing, and golf course acquisition work for properties across the United States, serving hundreds of clients.   In 2020 Maxim Golf purchased its first golf property ( Eagle Knoll Golf Club , Jefferson City, MO), adding it to its portfolio of managed clubs. Eagle Knoll, known as the “Golfing Gateway to the Ozarks”, became a proving ground for innovative ideas for club management and evidence that Maxim Golf was willing to put its money where its mouth is. The proven work showcases to other club owners that Maxim looks through the lens of club ownership just as its clients do. This acquisition also formed a bond with Eagle Knoll’s developer John Bode, a successful publishing magnate who became part of Maxim’s leadership team. In 2023, Maxim Golf purchased its second property, Dub’s Dread Golf Club (Kansas City, KS). Dub’s Dread is notable for once being the longest golf course in the world, adding some rich history to Maxim Golf’s portfolio of managed clubs.  Players such as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, and Ben Hogan walked the fairways a time ago, leaving a legacy that can’t otherwise be experienced in the Kansas City area. Today Maxim Golf strategically manages 18 properties across the Midwest and Mountain West and has a specialized interest in small-city municipal golf management paired with ownership in three properties. Maxim’s goal is to help properties in varying market sizes and geographical locations maximize their potential. Maxim is known for its outstanding agronomic practices as well as its unique ability to offer exceptional member and patron experiences. Our devotion to changing the future landscape of golf and recreation drives us to be the best for all current and future clubs.

Beautiful picture, bright, and shipped promptly! GMR 09/10/2025 BenQ AK700ST 4000 Lumens Short Throw 4K Laser Golf Simulator Projector Optoma ZW350ST WXGA Short Throw Laser Projector Great projector when space is limited. Light weight for ceiling installations. Ken 09/08/2025 Optoma ZW350ST WXGA Short Throw Laser Projector MLM2PRO great experience! Very happy with the MLM2Pro. Shipped fast, works great. Played a full 18 simulated round at home with my buddy the other day - was awesome! Zev Hattis 09/02/2025 Rapsodo MLM2PRO Launch Monitor, with FREE 45-Day Premium Software Membership Great for the Price - Really Good Tool for Improving Your Game! For the money, it's great stuff. Especially if you get the 10% off + free shipping deal. The thing that's kinda sucky is that you have to use iPad / iPhone -- it would be incredible if I could interface with a computer. My phone and ipad struggle to keep up, and if I want to connect to a tv I can't charge the device at the same time. It would be nice to have a computer for the graphics / speed improvement and so I could charge whilst playing on a tv. In terms of data / dispersion, ease to setup, etc. Incredible. Really good stuff. The. slow motion impact camera really helps build intuition about your missed shots and good shots alike. It's a great tool for improving. spencer spencer cochran 08/16/2025 Rapsodo MLM2PRO Launch Monitor, with FREE 45-Day Premium Software Membership Fast shipping, great communication. Craig 08/06/2025 Rapsodo MLM2PRO Launch Monitor, with FREE 45-Day Premium Software Membership I LOVE this launch monitor You will not be disappointed if you purchased this launch monitor. Installation was very easy, seems extremely accurate, and the fact that the accompany continuously is updating software and firmware is fantastic. Highly recommend. Tim Schulz 06/06/2025 ProTee VX Launch Monitor Easily the best golf net out there! I started out with a cheap net from Amazon, but the balls kept flying back out of it and I had to chase them down. Finally did some research and ended up with the Sprornia net, and boy am I glad I did! I can hit anything from wedge to driver and the balls stay in the net as intended. It is also much more sturdy than the old net. Can't recommend this net enough! Lee T 05/21/2025 Spornia SPG-7 Golf Practice Net - Standard Edition AK700ST from GSD Haven’t had a chance to set up the projector yet, but it came nicely packaged and GSD had the best price around! Sean Jones 05/11/2025 BenQ AK700ST 4000 Lumens Short Throw 4K Laser Golf Simulator Projector Great Mat I purchased a sim package that included the enclosure, screen, launch monitor, projector, and hitting mat.  After an hour of hitting on the mat, my wrists were killing me.  My wife also experienced pain in her arms when using that mat.  I did a lot of research and found the SIGPRO Softy golf mat.   It has a very soft replaceable hitting section in the mat. We can now hit off the mat as long as we want with no wrist or arm pain. Although pricey, I highly recommend this mat. CRAIG PILGRIM 04/28/2025 SIGPRO Softy Golf Mat The shipping was a little slow but Matt was was great at explaining to me what the problem was. Overall my experience was great. Mike 04/24/2025 BenQ LK936ST 5100 Lumens Short Throw 4K HDR Laser Golf Simulator Projector Great company to work with When I started building the sim, I decided to piece out all the components instead of the “sim in a box” option. The computer really is one of the most integral components, and SurfThing killed it. Awesome customer service and accurate shipping and tracking information. They even aided in setup and integration between the softwares. Highly recommended! Danny Morgan 04/22/2025 SurfThing SG2-4714 Golf Simulator Computer Projector is stellar! I love this projector. I was skeptical of the 1080p over the 4k projector but I have to say I am extremely satisfied.  Positioning a projector is an incredibly tedious process.  Not this one!  The one button auto fit takes all the stress out. Love it. I highly recommend! Chris Kassa 04/14/2025 BenQ AH700ST 4000 Lumens Short Throw 1080P Laser Golf Simulator Projector Absolutely exceeded my expectations! I was a bit nervous about transitioning from a Mevo+ to a camera-based system, but there was no need to worry—this setup is better than I imagined. It reads every shot accurately, even in low light, and putting performance is both reliable and precise. The connection between the launch monitor and computer is rock-solid with no interruptions. Hardware and software installation were quick and easy, and it integrates seamlessly with TGC 2019. Customer service from ProTee was prompt, helpful, and thorough. Highly recommended! Kevin 04/12/2025 ProTee VX Launch Monitor MLM2Pro The MLM2Pro gold simulator is awesome. I paired it with a spornia 8 net and set up in on one side in my backyard. Get a iPad stand as well to view your hits and stats.Golf simulators Direct was seamless to work with.
