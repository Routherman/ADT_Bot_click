      "text": "About Us - The Heroes Club Home Our Mission About US Our Members Events Contact Join Us ABout Us The Heroes Club is a non-profit, volunteer-based organization based in Carmel, Indiana with the goal of supporting the real-life heroes of public safety and law enforcement in our local area. We do this by providing an accidental death policy , mental health support , and equipment and training grants for local police, fire, and safety personnel. Our Mission Our History In 1996, a group of business executives and concerned citizens came together with a shared mission: to find a meaningful way to support public safety employees in times of need. This vision led to the incorporation of The Heroes Club as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in September of that year. From the beginning, our goal has been to show unwavering appreciation for the first responders who serve and protect Carmel and Clay Townships. One of our earliest and most impactful initiatives was establishing an accidental death policy to provide financial security to the families of officers who lose their lives in the line of duty. Initially set at $50,000, the policy was later expanded in response to the increased risks faced by public safety officers, particularly after 9/11. Thanks to the dedication of our members and generous donors, coverage has since grown to $400,000, ensuring greater protection for those who put their lives on the line for our community. Join Us 0 + Years Supporting Local Heroes 0 % Accidental Line of Duty Death Policy Increase Since Starting 0 + Current Local Members Why We Do It Our community’s first responders put their lives on the line everyday to protect us and our families. They also safeguard the places that enrich our lives and enhance our community, such as schools, churches, parks, community centers, and the many business places where we work and shop. If these public servants are killed in the line of duty their dependent spouses and children may require additional assistance. They deserve the same security their loved ones provide us.
