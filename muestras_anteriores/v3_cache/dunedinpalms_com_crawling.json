Close to the city centre including the octagon area with lots of eating places including Biggies pizza place. Another very nice receptionist on checkout who was very helpful about places to see.” Malcolm, Edinburgh “This was our first time to Dunedin. What made our experience so special was our customer service experience from the time we arrived and walked into the office and were greeted by a very pleasant young lady (Scottish accent), apologies for not taking note of your name. She was so helpful and pleasant. Also special thanks to Nandini Hela you couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful. Many thanks for the late check out and arranging our transfer to the airport. You made our stay so very pleasant and top marks to the owners for such a well appointed Motel. We have friends from Auckland travelling to your city soon and have recommended you.” Stotte, Auckland “I have been staying at this hotel frequently over the past few weeks and in summary – Staff are professional and attentive to guest needs – The units have all the amenities expected – The units have always been spotlessly clean – The motel is within minutes walk of the city centre and business district – The motel has excellent WiFi bandwidth. I have no reservations in recommending this motel to business and holiday travellers alike. On each visit I have been very comfortable in a spotlessly clean unit. All staff have provided nothing less than exceptionally good service and have always met my requests for dry cleaning services, etc., with no issues whatsoever. A well run and managed property.
