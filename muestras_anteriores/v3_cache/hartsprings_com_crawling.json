Hartsprings Foundation collects used, unwanted clothing and small household items and thanks to our partnership with Savers thrift stores, you can support Hartsprings Foundation by donating gently used clothing and small household items you no longer need at specified Savers locations. Savers purchases the donated goods from Hartsprings, providing us with revenue to continue our collection efforts and providing funding for our non-profit partners. To date, Hartsprings has generated millions of dollars in funding for these agencies. As of October 2023, our financial support has been dedicated to Big Brothers Big Sisters in Western Massachusetts and all of Connecticut. Big Brothers Big Sisters programs match local at-risk children with a volunteer Big Brothers or Big Sisters mentor through community-based and school-based programs. Research has found that Little Brothers and Sisters who participate are: 46% less likely to start using drugs 27% less likely to start drinking 52% less likely to skip a day of school More confident in their schoolwork Get along better with their families In addition, your donations to Hartsprings also help to protect and preserve our environment, keeping more than 5 million pounds of clothing and small household items out of local landfills each year. How you can help Schedule a donation pickup Drop off your donation Organize a neighborhood collection day Host a donation bin Place a collection box at your business Partners Copyright 2016 Hartsprings Foundation, 266 Cold Spring Ave., West Springfield, MA All Rights Reserved | Powered by alias | solutions Page load link Go to Top"

Super big sites, lot's of room to back up. Lots of shaded sites along the perimeter sites and very roomy. Backs up to woods. Full hookups were good, no issues.

I recommend site #03 Note: our GPS tried to take us down a small dirt road when we got close. I trusted the GPS more than the roadside sign pointing to the campground.

It is clean, the sites are relatively spacious, the campground is relatively small and if I had kids with me, I would pick sites in the middle of the campground instead of around the edge of the campground, as your campsite would back into the field and it becomes a really large playground for them. The springs itself is about a 5 - 10 min walk away and is paved.  Along the way, there are 4 other marked trails, which I gather from our walk is hardly used, as a good sections of these are overgrown, so you need to be looking for the trail blaze.

The campground checkin process was lengthy, with a long list of rules and an emphasis on the no alcohol limitation (not observed by everyone). The sites are large and spacious and each have an old picnic table and fire ring. There are a lot of ants everywhere, so keep that in mind and watch where you walk. There is a short trail that leads down to the springs, which are open an extra our earlier/later for the campground residents in addition to the normal 9:00am - 7:30pm. We enjoyed the quieter hours after everyone else had left and sometimes found ourselves completely alone in the spring. Keep in mind that the forested trail leading to the springs is loaded with mosquitoes and I wouldn't suggest doing it on foot (we biked several times and still got eaten alive). Another thing to keep in mind is that the spring will close often if the river level rises (after periods of heavy rain), in which case you can still visit other springs in the area that are not as close to the river. The AT&T cell reception was hit or miss and it was a struggle to work with the data connection. All in all we enjoyed our stay here and would come back again.

Park has potential but is not maintained very well, the pool was just emptied and repaired but still had leaves and scum on the water and was very high in. Chemicals. Asked staff if there was a spot to run my dog off leash, was told the ball diamond was a good place. I went to the ball diamond no one was around until the park manager drove his truck across the field between me and my dog. He told me that all dogs must be on a 6 foot leash. He was very aggressive and hostile. Went back to the park staff that said it was ok, they now changed their tune and said I must have misunderstood them. Funny this same staff member opened the gate for me and my dog. The bathrooms are mopped but not clean, the facilities are not maintained. When we were there the toilets were loose and it took two days to fix just one. Wifi is terrible and it shuts down every night around 9:30. My site has a load of stone dropped on a grass hill and that was considered a good base. The fire pit at the neighbours site it smoked us out when ever they had a fire! This park could be very nice under better management and if it was maintained properly. I will not stay here again left two weeks early on a one month stay with no refund!

We made a driving tour of the campground located here:  https://youtu.be/ftXgR7K8gPk. What a hidden gem! We booked Hart Springs because of its access to the natural spring, and we were overjoyed to find this amazing little park was more than we had hoped. Quiet, clean, and secure with so much space between sites. We thoroughly enjoyed the paved trail to the natural spring and the hiking trails on property. The camp hosts were very helpful, and the arrival/check-in process was super easy. Do pay attention to the route your GPS recommends you take. Our RV GPS tried to send us down a sand/dirt road right across from the country road the park is located on. Cell service was pretty spotty -- ATT seemed to be better than Verizon. Having a good wifi system in our rig helped overcome limited TV channels. The positives far outweigh any negatives here, though. We would definitely stay again! Pros: -- the amount of space between you and your neighbors is insane! -- 50 amp, full hook up (majority of the sites, can't confirm all of them) -- clean, quiet, and secure! -- easy online reservations -- paved walking/bicycle trail to the Hart Springs county park with an incredible natural spring and swimming area -- hiking trails (well-marked, well-maintained) -- amazing night sky views and owls galore! -- boardwalk along the Suwanee River -- helpful camp hosts -- able to receive packages at the campground Cons: -- Cell phone service is a bit of a challenge (Our Pepwave Max Transit Duo system worked well, as did our ATT Netgear Nighthawk), but our cell phones (Verizon) would lose service just outside of the park. -- Does require about a 15 minute drive to any restaurant or store ~Chris and Jody, Porter's Pilgrimage Access Location Cleanliness Site Quality Noise AT&T 5G Verizon 5G Chris and Jody would stay here again Helpful 0 This review is the opinion of a Campendium member and not of Campendium.com Bones 6 reviews “Nice place” Reviewed 11/27/2020 Days stayed: 3 Site Number: 69 Overall Rating It's a smaller park with one main shower area surrounded by a big common area in the middle with basket ball court, swings and shuffle board.

The bathrooms are ok. There is hot water and they are clean. There are two washers and two dryers that are in good working order. Site sizes very greatly. Site 69 is huge and pretty level. The spring (beautiful) and splash pad and bigger playground were a hit. The spring looked deceivingly uninviting compared to other springs we visited, but so glad we have it a chance. There are two deep spots. My one big disappointment is you cannot bicycle from campground to town with a kids trailer. The roadside is marked for bikes but overgrown in many spots.

All of those concerns went away once we got into the park. The sites were large with plenty of space in between. Our particular site could have fit a couple rigs in between us and the neighbors. Our site was relatively level side to side. It had a pretty big dip front to back. I noticed our neighbors had the tongue all the way to the ground on their travel trailer. We leveled out just fine on our site. The camp host was pleasant and gave us plenty of detail. We drove by the springs but didn’t get out and check it out. Too cold for us. I would definitely go back again if I’m trying to be in that part of the state.

This is a wonderful little campground, ran by the city/county.  The camp host (Kristy) is the sweetest person.  The property is very well maintained and the springs are beautiful.  It's not close to a lot (we go down to serve at a local horse rescue), but if you need to be in the area (or is you want to visit a park with springs)... this place is wonderful.  The Burger Spot in Bell had fantastic onion rings so, double bonus!  Property does have some big rig friendly sites and the road is easy to navigate.
