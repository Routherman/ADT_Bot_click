We are open at Cosmeston Lakes from Saturday 5th July 2025 7 days a week until 7th September. The weekend only for 13th & 14th September. Click book a splash to see times and availability. What about the wildlife at Cosmeston Lakes? A detailed ecological assessment, undertaken by local firm Acer Ecology, has confirmed that the seasonal Aqua Park at Cosmeston Lakes Country Park will have no significant negative impact on local birdlife or water vole populations. The Aqua Park will be situated away from sensitive bird nesting areas, further reducing any potential for disruption. The eastern lake, already supports a range of recreational activities such as paddleboarding, sailing, dog walking and scuba diving. The study shows that bird species in the area are already well adapted to this level of human activity. Many common bird species show high tolerance to disturbance and are unlikely to be affected by the seasonal operation of the inflatable water park, which are temporary structures. Extensive surveys and habitat assessments on water voles where carried out, which found that the area proposed for the Aqua Park has limited suitability for water voles. The park will be located on open shoreline lacking the vegetation that water voles rely on, and no signs of burrows or active vole presence were found in that specific zone. As such, the risk of harming water vole populations is considered negligible. The parks SSSI status is there because of one species of rare underwater plant, starry stonewart, which is only found in the western lake, the eastern lake is formally designated as suitable for recreational activity. The seasonal nature of the attraction, combined with safeguards, that the Aqua Park can operate safely and responsibly whilst maintaining the park’s wildlife conservation goals. What’s the water quality like at Cosmeston Lakes? Your safety is our top priority. The Aqua Park only opens when water quality meets recognised safety standards and conditions are safe for activities to take place. During the spring of 2025, a professional scuba diving team has surveyed the lakebed where the Aqua Park is located, in conjunction with a bathymetric depth survey, to confirm that there are no objects under the surface and that the water depth is suitable (3m – 12m). Our water samples are tested and analysed by Public Heath Wales at their UKAS-accredited laboratory. We take two samples at the same time and from the same location on the Aqua Park, which are tested side by side. This helps us identify any potential sampling or laboratory errors, as the two results should be very close to each other. For transparency, the graphs shown on our website display the average of the two results. Our closure policy is precautionary and always based on the worst result . We have been taking samples twice a week during the 2025 bathing season to ensure water quality remains safe. Two key indicators are tested: E. coli Intestinal Enterococci These bacteria occur naturally in the gut of humans and animals. Most strains are harmless, but high levels can indicate pollution and may pose a risk if swallowed. We follow guidance given directly to us by Swim England , who have stated that there should be no swimming when results are above the levels below. These are the same fail levels as World Aquatics and The Aqua Park Association, following national and international governing bodies 1,000 CFU/100ml for E. coli 400 CFU/100ml for Intestinal Enterococci Aqua Park Sessions may only resume once subsequent testing has shown results are below these thresholds .We also adopt many of the principles of the World Aquatics testing regime , alongside the requirements of our own industry body, the Aqua Park Association , which accredits Aqua Parks across the UK. These same standard levels are applied across the country to a wide range of open water recreational activities, from Aqua Parks to open water swimming and even designated inland bathing waters. The graphs show bacteria levels over time, measured in colony-forming units (CFU) per 100ml . The red line shows the Fail threshold. Beneath the red is considered Good Quality The green line shows the Excellent threshold. All our results from the 2025 bathing season are published here. To date, the water has consistently met the standards required for safe bathing. Where is Cosmeston Lakes Aqua Park?

So in 2014, the mid-town Water Works Park in Tampa was established and now the newly rejuvenated area gets ‘invaded’ all year round by both locals and visitors. KOMPAN had a really good track record, and besides having great designs, that was a plus for us to be able to have the whole package. Karla Price - Landscape Architect, City of Tampa 5 items Adventure awaits The park reflects the adventures of times long ago. A broad Corocord rope climbing frame is approachable from every angle and leads to a crow’s nest where today’s buccaneers can look out over the other features of the playground. Younger kids can play on the Elements tower and with bobbing and diving dolphins on the Ocean Seesaw. The park also has KOMPAN classics such as the Supernova carousel and the spinning Spica.

Additionally, bulk water is sold directly to the Summit Township Water Authority and Fairview Township Water Authority for distribution to their customers. The map below depicts the primary and bulk service supply areas of Erie Water Works. Download Map PDF Potable water is essential to economic growth and development. The City of Erie and many of its surrounding municipalities are fortunate to be located within the boundaries of the Great Lakes Drainage Basin (GLDB). Water within the basin replenishes Lake Erie’s water supply. In turn, the water from Lake Erie can be used as public water to areas located within the GLDB. The water from Lake Erie is protected from being diverted outside the GLDB by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 insuring an abundant supply of water for future generations. The Great Lakes Water Basin is depicted as the blue-shaded areas in the map below and exists as the potential expansion service area of Lake Erie water.
