Find your home Our Journey A 11-Year Legacy of Growth and Commitment In the ever-evolving landscape of the construction and property development industry, Imperial Homes has carved out a remarkable niche since 2013. Founded by Joe Dorrington, whose roots in construction run deep thanks to his father’s expertise in groundworks, the company began its journey with a single property earmarked for refurbishment. Little did they know that this initial venture would lay the groundwork for a thriving business. The Humble Beginnings Imperial Homes started with a vision: to transform properties and create beautiful living spaces. Joe, driven by a passion for construction and a commitment to quality, recognized the potential of that first property. With determination and hard work, the first new build site was established , comprising two homes that set the standard for the developments to come. This marked the beginning of a journey fuelled by ambition and a desire to make a difference in the community. Key Milestones in Growth As the years rolled on, Imperial Homes steadily gained momentum. By 2017, the company welcomed Richard Paine as a director. With his extensive background in fostering partnerships between developers and housing associations like Vivid, Richard brought a wealth of experience that proved invaluable. His insight into strategic collaborations not only expanded Imperial Homes’ reach but also enhanced its reputation as a trustworthy developer. In 2019, the company took another significant step forward with the addition of Ben Olds as Land Director. Ben’s expertise in securing prime land opportunities allowed Imperial Homes to build a robust land bank, enabling them to pursue stunning developments that resonate with both current market demands and community needs. His vision helped ensure that each new project aligned with the company’s commitment to quality and sustainability. A Trajectory of Growth With the leadership of Joe, Richard, and Ben, Imperial Homes has undergone remarkable growth over the past 11 years. The company has evolved from its modest beginnings into a respected player in the property development sector, known for its dedication to craftsmanship and community-oriented designs. Imperial Homes remains dedicated to preserving the charm and character of their smaller developments. Each project is approached with an understanding that homes are not just structures, but spaces where families create memories and communities thrive. This philosophy has guided the company’s efforts to develop properties that are both beautiful and functional, ensuring that they meet the needs of the people who will inhabit them. Looking Ahead As Imperial Homes continues to grow, the focus remains on building lasting relationships, both within the industry and with the communities they serve. The company is excited about the future, with plans to expand its portfolio while maintaining the integrity and craftsmanship that have become its hallmark.
