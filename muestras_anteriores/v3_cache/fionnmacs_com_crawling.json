The inspiration for this collection of pubs came from our founder’s trip to Ireland in the early 1990s. The unique culture and hospitality found in Irish pubs called “Craic” is the essence of Fionn’s. It’s about connecting with people, sharing a story and a laugh while listening to some live music over a perfectly poured pint and great food. Today’s Irish Pub, done right. Visit the website GREAT FOOD. GREAT FRIENDS. GREAT BEER. Good Served Here Relax you’re on pub time At our pub, we don’t separate what we believe from what we serve. We believe quality time should be spent over quality fare. Which is why we will always strive to satisfy your appetite for honest food and great company, while bringing you good times that happen for no reason – which is the best reason of all. Our food and beverage menu is inspired by the best Irish pubs there are. Mouth-watering comfort food for a great time with friends and family. For an optimal experience, our menu is to be shared and our large choice of cocktails and beers will not leave you without thirst! HOW TO BECOME A FRANCHISEE?
