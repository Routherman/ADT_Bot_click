BOOK NOW Flûte Bar Floating Bubbles BOOK NOW About Gallery Menus Restaurant Policies The world’s highest open-air champagne Bienvenue à Flute. The highest open-air champagne in the world, perched on a platform above Bangkok icons Sirocco and Sky. It’s the perfect vantage point to take in the magic and merriment of the whole sky-high scene, and experience some magic of your own. About Flute After a couple flutes of fine champagne, you might begin to feel like your platform in the sky is actually a stage, and perhaps you’re the star of the show. That’s how champagne this exquisite—this rare—can make you feel. Special. Elevated. Like somewhere along the way you must have done something very right, to end up here. With a living wall designed to evoke a vineyard—a vineyard in the sky, that is—Flute is a place to sip slowly and take it all in. These precious liquids are meant to be savoured—experienced fully. After all, some of these experiences will never be repeated. These exclusive bottles of bubbly feel like they should be in a museum—but instead, a fortunate few get to touch them. Consume them. Lucky you! Flute is the only place you’ll find them in Thailand. Also exclusive to The Dome: Exclusive House of Caviar including Caviar Service, Imperial Beluga, Beluga, Royal Oscietra and Oscietra, and premium oysters . With Flute, we invite you to live like a bon vivant, if only for the night.

Opens Closed Location: 20, Broadwick Street, W1F 8HT Budget: Type of night: Chatting and Drinking Type of venue: Wine Bar What they say: FlÃ»te was created by founder and owner Hervé Rousseau, in 1997. A native Parisian, Hervé was inspired by his experience in the wine industry to combine New Yorks unparalleled cocktail culture with a French attitude towards champagne, where no one waits for a special occasion to pop open a bottle of bubbly. With 15 years experience in working with champagne houses, Hervé is one of America's top ambassadors of French Champagne. Now branching out to London, FlÃ»te is due to open in December 2011 and will be an ideal place to take a date you're wishing to impress. What we say: Due to its strong international following and excellent reputation we're really excited for the opening of Flûte in London. With its great central location (just seconds away from Oxford Circus ) and its exquisite interior Flûte is going to be one of the most popular cocktail bars in London . The capital is certainly lacking in high-end, luxurious Champagne Bars but we're certain Flûte's opening will put a stop to that and turn in to a regular haunt amongst celebrities .
