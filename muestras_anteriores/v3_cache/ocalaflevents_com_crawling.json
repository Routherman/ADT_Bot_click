We have been building a tight-knit family held together by a culture of inclusivity. Our desire is to function as a beacon in the community and a home to people from all walks of life, where they can come together and enjoy themselves in each other's company. ​ Our kitchen aims to delight diners with a thoughtfully curated seasonal menu utilizing utmost creativity to perfectly mirror the art showcased throughout the visually-immersive space. Our team is focused on delivering an experience revolving around a seasonal menu and curated cocktails, all made from locally sourced ingredients. We keep an ear to the heartbeat of the city and bring artistic talent, both culinary and visual, within the walls of Fulton Market Kitchen. ​ Inspired by the 1980s NYC art scene and the Wynwood Walls in Miami, Fulton Market Kitchen offers guests the rare opportunity to enjoy dining, drinking, and the work of incredible artists in a single, truly unique setting.

Together they have developed an impressive spirit list that boasts over 650 bottles with a special focus on hand-selected barrels, limited allocations, and rare vintages. This eclectic compilation showcases all possible flavor profiles and is guaranteed to speak to every palate. The wine list highlights bottles by our favorite winemakers and regions, with unique yet approachable varietals, balanced between Old and New World sparkling, sherry, roses, whites and reds. To round off our beverage program, the team has provided a quirky selection of season-appropriate beers that are produced by leaders in the craft beer community. Our goal at Fulton Market Kitchen is to provide guests with a rustic yet refined dining experience and an extensive list of libations to keep you happy and coming back for more. \"12 Best-Looking New Restaurants Across the U.S.\" - Zagat Fulton Market Kitchen’s art collection is the result of a collaboration with numerous contributing artists, representing several artistic styles: Erni Vales, Erik DeBat, Franklin Riley, Dominic Sansone, CJ Hungerman, Christophe Gauspohl, Chadwick, Sarah Raskey, Alex Morales, and many more. We continuously strive to be a highly artist-friendly and collaborative channel for the vibrant local art community; to work together to exhibit, educate and sell their work. Throughout the year our Art Director Alexander Tsanov programs a variety of live painting sessions and gallery shows. Regularly we host our live painting sessions on a bi-weekly basis on Thursday nights. Artists join us for the evening and paint during the dinner service as the bar team offers up a cocktail specially designed to pair with their artwork. Gallery shows are held upstairs in our studio space where our guests are able to meet and mingle with the artist and get a sense of their work. Our goal is to provide the space and opportunity for developing artists to showcase their work to a public that is there to engage with it and to offer an insight on the process and work that normally goes unseen with art-making. Be sure to follow our social media channels for all news and updates on our art program. ​ For all other questions and enquiries please email alex@fultonmarkethospitality.com Harrison Steinbuch during his interactive painting session.
