We were first time visitors to this annual event, though I suspected my family would enjoy, as they had fun at Treasure Island’s Sanding Ovations. Turns out it was a hit, with a couple lessons learned in the process! Event runs until April 23rd. Visit Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival on the Weekday We visited on the weekend. Traffic was “literally crazy” in the words of my 7 year old, who currently prefixes most statements with “literally”. 🤷🏼‍♂️ If you can visit during the week, do that instead. Ride the free Park and Ride on the Weekend If you visit on the weekend, ride the free Park and Ride. It drops you off and picks up right outside the festival! No need to find a parking spot. Afterwards, as we sat on the cold bus (“literally freezing” per Colt), I told my wife this was one of my better recent decisions. You still sit in traffic, but I can’t even imagine trying to find parking in Clearwater Beach. It was bumper to bumper from 2 miles out. Decades Theme for Sand Sculptures is Great The “Decades, Blast from the past” theme of the sculpture festival was great. I especially enjoyed seeing my childhood represented with for instance E.T., Home Alone, Slash, Run DMC, Slash, Mario Brothers, Simpsons, Ghostbusters, MTV, The NeverEnding Story, and many more just in those couple decades alone. A trip down memory lane! The Sand Sculpture Festival Costs Money, but Worth It You need to pay $14 to see the sculptures. Ages 3 and under are free. The huge 21K sqft tent offered many more sculptures than another local sand sculpture festival, and includes themed music and lighting for the decades. Looks like it took someone a lot of work, plus proceeds benefit local charities per organizers. And you know what, some days, I’d simply pay for shade on the beach. 😅. Btw, that’s where Beachfront Bellhop comes in… Bring Towel or Seating, plus Sunblock Bring a towel or blanket and sunblock. Something to sit on didn’t cross our mind, but inevitably you’re going to end up on the beach itself. Especially if near sunset or you have children. The sculptures inspired Colt to want to build his own, so we ended up digging on the beach in our regular clothes, throwing a curveball to those playing “spot the tourist”. If you can, try to time your visit with the amazing daily sunset. Two birds, one trip. Wear Easy to Remove Shoes Wear shoes that are easy to remove. The sculptures are not built around sidewalks, you’re walking thru sand as you roam. 🏰 Much easier to walk barefoot in sand than with shoes. Figure You’ll Stay in Clearwater Beach for a While Don’t plan to just look at the sculptures and leave. It’s not going to happen. There’s much to do, even if you don’t buy a ticket to visit the actual sand sculpture tent. Sit on the beach, walk the pier, check out the street artists, grab food and drink from one of the many vendors (street corn!), and might as well check out nearby bar/restaurants just a few steps away. I mean, as long as you already have parking (or park and ride) why not. We ended up making an afternoon of it and arrived home well after dark. Hope you enjoy!

The Brief The Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival starts Friday, and 17 sculptors from all over the world are in Clearwater Beach preparing now. They’re building their creations over three weeks ahead of the festival’s 11th year. The theme this year is Dinoshores. The theme this year is Dinoshores. CLEARWATER BEACH, Fla. - The Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival, presented by Visit St. Pete Clearwater, starts Friday, and 17 sculptors from all over the world are in Clearwater Beach preparing now. \"We’re working with 1,000 tons of your beautiful beach sand here,\" sand sculptor Karen Fralich said. READ: Clearwater leaders delay vote on selling street to Church of Scientology The backstory: The sand, brought into the 24,000-square-foot exhibit straight from Clearwater Beach, acts as a symbol of how far the beach community has come. Six months ago, it seemed like the sand was everywhere but the beach. \"The back-to-back hurricanes, Helene and Milton, were devastating to Clearwater Beach,\" Lisa Chandler, the founder of the festival, said. \"We are so blessed that our city government, the City of Clearwater, was able to put Clearwater Beach back together in a remarkable amount of time, sifting the sand, cleaning the sand.\" \"The resiliency of this beach community to come together, the importance of tourism. It is our number one economic engine for this beach… everyone came together to bring the sand back to life,\" Chandler said. Follow FOX 13 on YouTube What they're saying: Now, sand sculptors are adding life to the sand in another way. They’re building their creations over three weeks ahead of the festival’s 11th year. The theme this year is Dinoshores. \"I’m addicted to sand sculpting,\" Fralich said. Fralich, who’s from Canada, has been sculpting sand for 31 years. This is her 10th year participating in the Sugar Sand Festival. \"Here in Clearwater, you have beautiful sand. It's very, very fine, powdery and fluffy, and when you add water to it, it packs really, really easily, and you can carve it,\" Fralich said. \"First you have to compact the sand with water. You can't just work with a soft, fluffy dry pile. It has to be compacted, and it has to be very, very wet. And that takes a lot of elbow grease, but luckily, we're all crazy. We love to shovel and pound sand and get really, really dirty, which we do. And after you compact it, then you can start carving it, and you have to start at the top and carve your way down. Otherwise, everything you carve would fall on what you've carved below.\" MORE: Could Pinellas County soon have a county mayor? Proposal would create new top office Dig deeper: They’ve expanded the exhibit this year to 24,000 square feet, and added an augmented reality portion, projecting images onto the sculptures to bring them to life. \"We have libraries of footage that we can put on to different types of things, and we also will go out and search for specific footage that we think or imagine might look good on here,\" Dave Gordon from Enlightened Monkey Arts, the company doing the augmented reality portion, said. When the festival ends, they move the sand back onto the beach. What To Know: The Festival also includes eight nights of Frenchy’s free beach concerts, fireworks, free sand sculpting classes and more. You can also park for free in downtown Clearwater and hop on the Jolley Trolley that will take you to the Festival for free. Tickets are $14 plus tax and kids three and under are free. There’s also a VIP option for $70 that includes dinner, drinks, a festival t-shirt, great seats for the concerts and entrance to the festival. It runs April 11 through April 27.

We enjoyed hosting family from out of town and playing tour guide. Busy week, but love calling the Tampa Bay Area home! Anyone ready for the weekend?! [raises hand excitedly] Couple Items: Today is opening day for the 2023 Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival, presented by Visit St. Pete/Clearwater. More on that below! The theme is Decades, as the sculptors take a trip back in time. LovingStPete started a new Facebook group to give YOU a forum to share your love of our area. Actually, any beachfront or waterfront area. Post a pic of your favorite beach, sandbar, waterway, boating area, etc. Tag the area/place when possible. We’re talking beautiful water and beach views from around the world. Inspiration to those who love to explore! Here’s the URL: https://www.facebook.com/groups/boatandbeach The Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival Onto the Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival, an event that “pays tribute to Tampa Bay’s two most valuable assets: our sugar sands and our sunsets!”. For the next 17 days, Clearwater Beach transforms to a world of sand sculpting. Aspects of the festival are free, though to access the 21,000 sqft tent of sand sculptures, you’ll need a ticket. The organizers mention the proceeds benefit charities around the Tampa Bay area and offset cost of the master sculptors who come from around the world. From a free perspective, you’ll be able to see the fireworks (every Saturday at 9:30pm), concerts, partake in the sand sculpting classes and more. Sugar Sand Fest Ticket Cost The tent’s entry cost is $14/person and free for ages 3 and under. VIP Lounge tickets are $70. Here’s the link for tickets: https://www.sugarsandfestival.com/p/tickets (all on-site ticket purchases are cashless payment options only). Note that if you’re military, police officer, firefighter, teacher or healthcare worker, you can purchase $10 tickets on “Frontline Fridays” April 7th, April 14th and April 21st. Free Classes to Learn Sand Sculpting Upon arrival, you’ll be transported to the world where the imaginations of skilled artists run wild. You can even participate in free classes to learn the skills necessary to build your own. I’m mentioning these classes near the top of the post, given the general “experiences” theme of LovingStPete. The classes are daily at 2pm, except on Saturdays, when it’s at 11am. Free Activities at the Sugar Sand Festival in Clearwater Beach Additionally, they offer other free activities for all ages, “including a children’s play area, street performers, artisans, live entertainment, fireworks, sand sculpting classes, speed sand demonstrations and the master sand sculpting competition”.  There’s also a cornhole tournament tomorrow (Saturday 4/8)! Ferris Wheel and Bounce Houses For a $7/person fee you can ride the Ferris wheel and for $3/person you’ll have access to the inflatables (ie bounce houses). There’s also $20 and $30 options for unlimited access, respectively. Give their Facebook page a follow if you’re curious on future days and events! For instance, per the event’s page, today alone has the following happening: “- Sugar Sand Festival hours 10 am – 10 pm – Souvenir Photo Hours: 10 am- 9:30 pm – College Wall Art Master Sand Sculpting Competition – Artisans and Street Performers – Ferris Wheel and Inflatables – FREE sand sculpting class 2 pm – Tropico Sand Bar 3 pm by Hyatt Regency Clearwater Beach Resort and Spa – Hooters Hangout Entertainment: 3-7 pm Brek Milo – BayStar Restaurant Group VIP Lounge Experience: 5pm – Frenchy’s Free Beach Concerts: 7:30 pm Shawn Scheller & The Contenders” Items Allowed: Blankets Low lying beach chairs Not Allowed: Pets – only service animals are permitted on the sand. Pets however are permitted on the sidewalks, so long as they are on a leash. Grills, hibachis, or open flames of any kind. Glass containers or bottles Tents, canopies or umbrellas The Sugar Sand Festival is Rain or Shine This is a Rain or Shine event, as the sculptures are under a large tent. High winds are evidently the bigger threat to these sand sculptures and could close the festival at times. Accessibility: We have 2 complimentary sand wheelchairs and 2 motorized SandHelpers available at the Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival. They are available on a first come, first serve basis with a photo i.d. and signed waiver. There is a hard surface leading from the public sidewalk to the entrance of the Sugar Sand Walk Exhibit where the sand wheelchairs will be located. Thank you so much to Fun Ride Rentals for your partnership! For more information on additional beach wheelchair rentals, please contact Fun Ride Rentals for rates at (727) 519-3008 and Sand Helper at 727-213-5700 or https://www.sandhelper.com/ Parking: Parking: Per the event organizers, “if you arrive early in the day parking is plentiful in one of the three parking garages. If you are planning on attending later in the afternoon, may we suggest using the FREE Park and Ride from downtown Clearwater or the water taxi.” Please visit their website and social media accounts for additional details.
