Write a review! camper-771832 “Owner Cancelled Confirmed reservation because they routinely overbook - Has happened to numerous people” noted 12/19/2022 I called this campground on December 10, 2022 and talked to owner Sean. We got a guaranteed reservation for Dec 29, 2022 - Jan 4, 2023. He gave me a confirmation number for my stay over the phone. When he started to end our conversation after the verbal confirmation number, I told him that he probably needs all my information (address, kind of coach, email address, etc.). He said he didn't need it. I wanted to give him my credit card so he could take a deposit/pay for the entire 6 night stay. He said they don't need that either. I was skeptical but he assured me several times that I was guaranteed a spot with that confirmation number. To be on the safe side, I called back on December 15 and talked to his office manager. I gave her my name and confirmation number and wanted to verify our stay and rate I was quoted. She confirmed to me that we were \"good to go\". Today, Dec 18, 2022, I received a call from the same office manager and she told me they were cancelling our reservation because they had no place to put us. I told her that Sean had given me a confirmation number on December 10 and that she had verified it herself on December 15. I also told her we had made plans to meet friends, bought tickets to go to a college bowl game, and I had verified twice in the past 8 days my confirmation number. She didn't care and her exact quote was, \"We are a campground and we can cancel reservations anytime we want\". WHAT?!?! When I asked to speak to owner Sean, she said he wasn't taking any phone calls and then rudely hung up on me. We have been camping for 5 years at multiple campgrounds and have never not had a confirmation number honored. There were 2 other campgrounds that had availabilities when I booked this campground on December 10, but today they are full. I don't know what we are going to do. I called office manager back again to ask how they could possibly not honor our confirmed reservation and she said they were calling several people with confirmed reservations and cancelling their reservations as well. She then hung up on me again. DO NOT EVER TRUST THIS CAMPGROUND!! Edit Note Delete Note Helpful 0 Be the first to add a video for International RV Park & Campground! Add Video!

Legend Reviewed Nov. 10, 2022 Not Quite The Epcot RV Experience I have to admit, with a name like International RV Park Campground, I was expecting, I don’t know, something much more like Epcot Center but for the RV’ing crowd, but there was no real cosmopolitan or multicultural experience (or foreign languages or exotic restaurants for that matter) to be had. That said, if you have an RV and are in town for Daytona Speedway or perhaps even the beaches (although for this latter attraction, I would submit that you are too far west), then International RV Park Campground provides super easy off-road access to a fairly spartan and incredibly quiet night underneath the stars (that is, if your RV has a moon roof). From an amenities standpoint, you’ll find nice flat, well-paved roads throughout the campground, full RV hook-ups (water, electric and sewage), where free WiFi is offered for your non-stop web surfing pleasure, an onsite mini-mart (say hi to Sean for me!), coin-operated washer and dryers, a fairly cool club house (where you can take over a table, throw down some cards and have a nice poker match), outdoor pavilions, sanitary dump station, scattered picnic tables, BBQ grills, propane gas refilling station, pin-coded bathhouse and restrooms (that are incredibly clean) and two different community pools with patio lounge furniture. Everywhere you go, pets are welcomed, so bring your furry friends! While International RV Park Campground isn’t the only campground in town or nearby, what distinguishes it from the others is that it has 2 different small lakes that really amp up the natural feel to the place. Plus, unlike many of the other campgrounds that are placed too close to I95 and I4 for my taste, in just a short time after exiting either highway, you really can get lost from all of the concrete jungle and feel as though you have truly escaped all the noise, traffic and congestion that is less than a mile away from this place. Add to this, the camping community that I discovered here is absolutely fantastic with staff that are incredibly welcoming and helpful. Insider’s tips? Here’s a few: (1) As nice of a roadside pit stop this might be, it is not a destination, so get in late, leave early, but make a reservation well in advance; (2) If you find yourself lucky enough to be here on the weekend, you’ll want to check out Daytona Flea & Farmers Market conveniently located down the street from where you are staying and right across the street from Daytona RV Speedway; (3) While you couldn’t find a place more heavily trafficked in the entire state of Florida, in just a short 20 minute drive further west, you can discover Tiger Bay State Forest, which has an amazing hiking trail called Buncombe Hill Trailhead that’s a nice distraction from this otherwise concrete jungle; and (4) Even though you are surrounded by a ton of franchise restaurant chain eateries like Cracker Barrel, BJ’s, Tijuana Flats and Waffle House, I highly recommend Double Barrel Grill, which functions as one part whiskey distillery and also operates a shooting range – my recco for this restaurant is the fried bologna slider - don’t knock it till you’ve tried it!

Ride safe and have a blast at Idaho Dunes RV! Meet the Team Mike McGroarty Owner Mike McGroarty has been an off-road, aviation, and outdoor enthusiast his entire life.  At the age of 15, Mike earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America and by that time had over 300 nights of wilderness camping experience.  His love for the outdoors turned into a passion for off-roading as soon as his first job earned him enough income to purchase his first sport ATV.  This first ATV started an addiction for rock crawling, trail riding and sand duning that still occupies 100% of Mike’s interest to this day. Garrett McGroarty Manager Garrett McGroarty was born into the “Idaho Dunes Way of Life”.  At 3 years old, Garrett started his off-road passion on a Kawasaki KFX 50.  Garrett has logged more trail miles between Idaho Dunes RV and West Yellowstone than anyone in the area.  At a young age, Garrett developed a passion for helicopters and aviation.  Before graduating from high school, Garrett earned both his private helicopter license (PPL-H) and commercial helicopter license (CPL-H).  With advanced pilot training from the best instructors in the industry at Helisafe in Southern California, Garrett has mastered the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopters flight systems and emergency procedures.
