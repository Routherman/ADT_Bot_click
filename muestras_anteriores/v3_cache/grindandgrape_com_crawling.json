Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Residents and business owners in Vero Beach are asking Grind & Grape to clean up the confetti they left in the streets from their New Year’s Eve party. “Maybe head out on the streets and clean the mess that you did? What a shame. If they can clean up NY Times Square, then surely you could clean up this mess. Our town has a hard enough time keeping it clean from others you being a business out on the island is no exception,” Tracy Lynn Johnson wrote on Grind + Grape’s Facebook page. As of January 2nd at 2:00 p.m., the NYE confetti can be seen on the sidewalks and street. A patron reported that they shot off the confetti and filled the establishment and public street on January 1st. However, they never cleaned it up. “Be responsible and clean the mess up properly,” Susan McGuigan said. The pictures showing some of the confetti were posted on social media Thursday. Confetti littered on streets in Vero Beach. “Why don’t you go outside and clean your mess after your done? Ridiculous, and it’s not safe. Y’all should get fined,” Heather Johnson said. “Hello, the street is still littered with the confetti you shot out all over it. Is it biodegradable? You are polluting our waters,” Leelee Havenlea wrote to Grind and Grape. “When are you going to clean up the streets? You made the mess, you should clean it up, don’t you agree,” Cassie Beddow wrote on Facebook. Last year, we published a Grind + Grape review showing that their New Year’s Eve ball was still up during the month of March. Following the review, some patrons were banned by the establishment after they shared our review on Facebook. FEATURED EVENTS To add your event, call 772-925-5221.

Try something else! about us Grind is a coffee company that lives in London. We’re on a mission to change the way we drink coffee for the better. Because with the amount of coffee we consume, we realised it would be nice to drink it with a clear conscience. And there’s nothing about our home-compostable pods that we feel guilty about. David Abrahamovitch, Founder & CEO. David is the founder & CEO of Grind. In 2011, alongside his friend Kaz James, he turned his father’s old mobile phone store in Shoreditch into a coffee shop called Shoreditch Grind. As it evolved, Shoreditch Grind became a “café by day and cocktail bar by night” and the first location became an East London institution. Over the last decade, Grind has grown to become the breakout coffee challenger brand in the UK, with fourteen locations across London, a thriving online business serving hundreds of thousands of customers around the world, and Grind coffee beans, coffee cans and coffee pods are available in most major UK grocers. Grind is also the global coffee supplier to Soho House, and is partnered with other best-in-class brands like Oatly and Brewdog. David’s vision is to grow Grind into the world's leading challenger coffee brand, encouraging people around the world to enjoy speciality coffee, sustainably. @davidabrahamovitch David is the founder & CEO of Grind.

We created the UK’s first home-compostable coffee pod. This was (and still is) a big deal. Unlike so many aluminium and plastic pods that dominate the market, ours are made from plants.

Like all the best things in life, we began in Shoreditch. That was back in 2011 when our founder, David, turned his father’s mobile phone store into the first Grind café—but think “coffee shop by day, cocktail bar by night” (primarily a homage to the holy grail of cocktails: the Espresso Martini). Now, we’re all over London with 14 sites and our very own roastery, and we put a decade’s worth of coffee knowledge into home-compostable pods.

A little about us: Two of our favorite things in life are traveling and spending time with friends, family, and meeting new people who become friends. We moved to Germany in August of 2021, and living abroad has certainly been an adventure. We started our website to share our stories with family and friends back home, and to have a travel diary with photos of our trips. Besides our collection of travel stories and tips , we have a page for foods of the world , which includes our culinary adventures and recipes we collect from around Europe. We also share some of our favorite books , both fiction and non-fiction, mostly around travel or food themes. Lastly, our page for living abroad includes local trips, international sporting events, and festivals around Germany. We love the feeling of home and fellowship that Irish Pubs all over the world offer. With this in mind, we try to style our stories to match the friendliness of the Irish, telling them as if we are sharing them with friends down at the pub . We hope that our site is either helpful, entertaining, or both. Cheers! We are so grateful for this opportunity to travel around Europe. Even the challenges of living in another country are an opportunity for growth. Sometimes we feel like we are semi-retired, because of the slower pace of life here. Often we dream of when we end this assignment and head back to the US. Buying a home after being an expat should be especially interesting. We’ll buy the first one that has air conditioning! Or a garbage disposal. For now, we’ll remember to appreciate where we are and what we have. Meanwhile, we may look at living in another country. Italy always seems appealing! But enough about us. 😊 Search by TOPIC International Sports Mini Adventures Albania Austria Belgium Croatia Czech Republic Denmark Egypt England Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Latvia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Norway Poland Portugal Romania Scotland Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland Tunisia Turkey The Grain and Grape provides travel photos, stories, and recommendations from around the world.
