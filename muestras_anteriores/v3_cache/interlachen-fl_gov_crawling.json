With warmer weather on the horizon, residents will be allowed to water twice a week  instead of once, but just because you can water twice a week doesn’t mean you should.  Pay attention to the weather and look for signs of a stressed lawn. Only water when  necessary to conserve resources and keep your landscape healthy. Public water supply is the District’s largest water use, consuming about 626 million gallons  per day— enough to fill nearly 949 Olympic-sized pools daily. Much of this water is  allocated to outdoor irrigation. Adjusting landscape watering not only conserves water but  also enhances lawn and plant health by reducing the risk of mold, fungus, weak roots,  weeds, and pests. General watering restriction guidelines: Homes with odd-numbered or no addresses: Wednesday and Saturday. • Homes with even-numbered addresses: Thursday and Sunday. Nonresidential properties: Tuesday and Friday. Watering hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. is prohibited to reduce evaporation and enhance  soil absorption. Watering time: Limited to one hour per zone. Coverage: These restrictions apply to all water sources, including private wells and  pumps, ground or surface water, and water from public and private utilities. It does  not apply to residents or businesses that use reclaimed water to irrigate. These restrictions will remain in effect until Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025. As temperatures rise and evaporation rates increase, the need for watering grows. Shifting  to twice-a-week watering helps balance this demand, keeping landscapes healthy without  wasting water resources. Conversely, during fall and winter, cooler temperatures and  frequent rainfall make less irrigation necessary, which is why the restrictions change to  once per week. The District’s watering restrictions are in place to help preserve the region’s water supply,  protect the ecosystem, and prevent overwatering, which can lead to runoff and wasted  resources. By adjusting irrigation schedules to the changing seasonal conditions and only  watering when necessary, both residents and businesses help reduce unnecessary strain  on local water reserves. “Water conservation is essential to ensuring a sustainable water supply for future  generations,” said St. Johns River Water Management District Water Conservation  Coordinator Kraig McLane. “By adhering to these seasonal restrictions, everyone plays a  crucial role in protecting our natural resources and maintaining a healthy environment.” For interview requests regarding watering restrictions, please contact Samantha Epstein at [email protected] . About the St. Johns River Water Management District St. Johns River Water Management District staff are committed to ensuring the sustainable use and  protection of water resources for the benefit of the people of the District and the state of Florida. The St.  Johns River Water Management District is one of five districts in Florida managing groundwater and surface  water supplies in the state. The District encompasses all or part of 18 northeast and east-central Florida  counties. District headquarters are in Palatka, and staff also are available to serve the public at service  centers in Apopka, Jacksonville and Palm Bay.

[2] From the time that the recall petition is approved for circulation, signatures must be collected within 30 days. The number of signatures required depends on the number of registered voters in the jurisdiction. A minimum of 50 signatures are required in jurisdictions with fewer than 500 registered voters. In jurisdictions with 500 to 24,999 registered voters, a minimum of 100 to 1,000 signatures are required, or 10% of registered voters, whichever is higher. In jurisdictions with 25,000 or more registered voters, the number of signatures required is 1,000 or 5% of registered voters, whichever is higher. [3] The officeholder then has a chance to file a defensive statement. In the second round of signature collection, organizers have 60 days to collect signatures equal to 15% of registered voters from the officeholder's district.

It developed as both a citrus growing center and a winter resort. When severe freezes in the 1890’s made it apparent that commercial citrus production was not economically viable, the town evolved into a retirement haven and later a bedroom community for Gainesville and Palatka. In the 1890s there were three hotels catering to the tourists that came to Interlachen. At a time when virtually all buildings here were wood and were illuminated with kerosene lamps and heated with wood burning stoves, fires were common. Two of the hotels burned to the ground around the turn of the century. Only the Lakeview House Hotel still stands. The Hotel Interlachen had 76 rooms and stood on Boyleston Street between Prospect Street and Tropic, (next to where the Lions Club is today). The block in front of the hotel was named Hotel Park and went all the way to Lake Chipco. It is now called Hastings Park It was a popular recreation area for adults with a tennis court and shuffleboard courts. Hastings Park is still in use today as a children’s playground and picnic area. The original Interlachen Town Hall was burned down in 1891 by cattlemen in a local dispute. The cattle at that time were free to roam wherever they wanted. Consequently they would get into the fruit trees and eat the oranges and leaves which frequently killed the trees. The cows were caught and put in the pound next to the Town Hall and the owners were charged a fee for their release, hence the dispute. The cattlemen’s intent was to burn the pound, but both the pound and the Town Hall were destroyed. A new Town Hall called Interlachen Hall was constructed in 1892 and housed an office, jail and a social room upstairs. After a new Town Hall opened in the Dickerman Building, Interlachen Hall became the library until the new library opened on CR 315 and Interlachen Hall became home to the Historical Society. The Society and the Town worked together to renovate Interlachen Hall. The renovation of Interlachen Hall was completed in 2003. The first floor currently houses the Interlachen Museum, which is operated by the Interlachen Historical Society and is open every Saturday, from 10 am to 2 pm. The upstairs is used as a community meeting hall. Anyone wishing to rent the hall may contact the Town Office at 386-684-3811.

One of the earliest settlers, George W. Hastings, had built a thriving rose nursery business between Lake Lagonda and Lake Chipco in the 1880s. The town became both a citrus growing center and a winter resort. By 1884, he had also built this hotel to accommodate the influx of visitors from the North. It was the first (and smallest) of 3 hotels that would be built in town and could accommodate 50 guests. In 1888, the community of Interlachen was incorporated. However local agriculture and the economy were heavily impacted by the freezes that would come just 10 years later in 1894 & 1895. New settlers from the North stopped coming and the trains through town became fewer and fewer. However, Hastings continued to successfully operate his nursery and feed store just in front of this hotel. But all of that changed in 1910. Virtually all the buildings in town were wood and illuminated with kerosene lamps. So when a fire broke out in Interlachen, it spread quickly, consuming most of the town, including Hastings Feed Store in front of this hotel. He subsequently relocated his business to Atlanta. The Lakeview Hotel was spared from the fire but the town’s other two hotels weren’t as fortunate. Below are photos of the two hotels that were lost in 1910. Hotel Interlachen The Hotel Interlachen had 76 rooms and stood on Boyleston Street between Prospect Street and Tropic, (next to where the Lions Club is today). The block in front of the hotel was named Hotel Park and went all the way to Lake Chipco.

Mollie was the hotel manager of the Lakeview Hotel and also served as Interlachen’s first librarian. This remaining example of hotel architecture from the time period is still in incredible condition for its age and is obviously maintained although it sits empty today. The detailed work on the trim, the simple yet grand lines of the roof, and the stunning red shade of paint make this place unique. It would be great to see it brought back to life.

Judi served on the Town’s Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBOA) from 2007-2010 In 2010, Judi got tired of sitting in the audience at Town Meetings and decided to run for the Council seat left open by a retiring member. She has been on the Council since that time, serving as Council Chairperson from 2011-2013,Vice-Chairperson for 2013-2014, Council Chairperson 2014-2015 and is currently Council Chairperson.
