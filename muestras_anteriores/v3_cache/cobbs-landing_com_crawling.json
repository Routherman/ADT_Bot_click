      "text": "Cobb's Landing in Fort Pierce City Marina features tiki bar atmosphere News Indian River Martin St. Lucie Sports Advertise Obits eNewspaper Legals DINING Restaurant review: Fort Pierce Cobb’s Landing, like dining in Key West Lucie Regensdorf Special to TCPalm FORT PIERCE — Here, on The Treasure Coast, we are fortunate to have some wonderful waterfront restaurants. A favorite among that cherished group is Cobb’s Landing. The restaurant is located on the Fort Pierce City Marina and has a Margaritaville-tiki-hut atmosphere that is both casual and inviting. There you can dine comfortably outdoors but be under cover from the heat of the sun and the rain of the summer afternoons. The restaurant also has outdoor tables marina-side. The tiki bar is very popular and every time I have visited, the stools are filled with happy patrons enjoying the mojito bar or the daily drink specials. When you walk in it’s as if you have stumbled onto Duval Street in Key West and ordered a Salty Dog. Live entertainment on the weekends completes the fun. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. We sat at a table in the corner and, partway through dinner, the window flaps were lowered to protect us from a torrential downpour. We stayed dry and comfortable and well-cared for by the staff. The menu is said to be “American cuisine and craft cocktails,” and who could argue with that? Starters include wings, fish dip, fried alligator — I was tempted but was vetoed — and blackened chicken quesadillas. Meals include tacos, burgers, salads, sandwiches, raw bar, fried fish platters, seafood gumbo, tuna poke bowl, tenderloin tips and veggie pastas, to name a few. If you have read any of my reviews, then you will not be surprised that one of the appetizers we ordered was crispy onion strings ($9). Sweet Vidalia onions were thinly sliced, breaded, fried crispy and served with tangy horseradish aioli. The onions were delicious. We also tried the crispy fried Asian calamari ($14). Tender calamari were served on a bed of mixed greens with Asian spices in a sweet chili vinaigrette garnished with sesame seeds. Being off to a good start, we went for the gold. Shrimp and grits ($22) was one diner’s choice. It is featured with a fried egg, but she opted out. The cheesy grits were creamy and rich, the shrimp tender and flavorful and the dish was chock full of sharp, smoky andouille sausage. The “Keys Disease” that afflicts folks in Florida’s southernmost region apparently led my husband to step out of his comfort zone and order a Figgy Burger ($16). I was somewhat concerned about him but our waitress, Taylor, reassured us it was a popular burger. His beef patty was cooked perfectly and topped with goat cheese, bacon and fig sauce. The combination of the tart and tangy goat cheese and the sweet fig jam was like a sunset on Mallory Square, both bizarre and delightful. Rajun Cajun pasta ($18) was another diner’s choice. Perfectly cooked bowtie pasta rocked strips of savory tasty, blackened chicken, chunks of smoky andouille sausage, creamy Cajun sauce and shaved parmesan cheese. I ordered the grilled salmon bowl ($24) because it had everything I loved. Sweet mango salsa and a piquant citrus aioli topped flaky fillets of salmon in a bowl full of white rice, spicy black beans and broccoli. With Key West on our mind, we shared the house-made Key lime pie ($9). A perfectly tart lime and creamy filling on a graham cracker crust with piped whipped cream and a raspberry drizzle and we were transformed. Dining at Cobb’s Landing will make you feel as if you have driven the Seven Mile Bridge to Key West. They offer waterfront dining, fun and engaging staff and a comfortable, open air and laid-back atmosphere. The food menu is seafood-centric but with plenty of options for landlubbers. And they offer drink specials and entertainment.

Both are successful businesses in their own right and feature fresh seafood, craft cocktails, live entertainment, and history. Drinking Buddies Interview How long have you been in the hospitality business? What is your background? “I have been in the hospitality business for 38 years. I started as a server at 20 and have worked every position in the industry, including Food Service Distribution, and have worked my way up to ownership.” Can you tell us the story about Cobb’s Landing? How did it get started? “I worked for the owners of TIki Bar & Restaurant in Fort Pierce, and in 2005, an opportunity to purchase the Cobb’s Landing restaurant came about. We opened the restaurant in January of 2006 and have been serving the Fort Pierce community since.” And what about Little Jim Bait & Tackle? “Little Jim Bait & Tackle is a historical icon of Fort Pierce, serving the Navy Seals back in WWII. The former owners were looking to retire and we were lucky enough to obtain the lease in 2019.” Can you tell us more about the menus at both locations? “We are constantly evolving with our menus to keep up with the changes and demands in today’s world. We try to know our customers and what they are looking for, which helps guide us.” “Cobb’s Landing features a variety of fresh seafood dishes, including tacos, entrees, a raw bar, and more.” Ahi Tuna Salad – Cobb’s Landing Coconut Shrimp – Cobb’s Landing “The menu at Little Jim is very casual, and we have items ranging from boiled peanuts to tacos and everything in between.  We also recently started our Breakfast on the weekends.” Pork Tacos – Little Jim Bait & Tackle What is your favorite menu item at each location? “At Cobb’s, my favorite has to be the Poke Bowl. At Little Jim, it’s definitely the Blackened Shrimp Tacos.” You have a nice selection of craft cocktails at each location. Can you tell us about the drink menu? “Our bar menus are so great!  We have a great infusion selection, along with our bourbon and tequilas. Our Craft Cocktails are collaborative between our bartenders, managers, and myself. We often try seasonal cocktails, too.” “At Little Jim, we have the ‘Lost in Paradise’ cocktail menu. It’s a collection of our customers’ favorite beverages like the Pullin Drag & Summergirl, which are both local charter boats that bring their clients to Little Jim. In addition, we have some longtime favorite creations like the Black Cherry Cooler.” There is also a variety of mocktails available. Is that something new that you are trying? “We added Mocktails a couple of years ago as the ” Taking a Break “movement from alcohol has become huge, and when you are the DD or choose not to drink, you still want to be able to have a cool beverage to sip on.” What is your go-to cocktail? “I’m a tequila girl, so my go-to is a Komos Rose Reposado on the rocks. But our Signature Pineapple Mojito is awesome. Little Jim’s Black Cherry Cooler is my favorite at that location, with the Pain Killer being a close second.” Has live entertainment always been a part of your hospitality business? “Yes, we have had live music for over 14 years. Over the last 2 years, we have incorporated it into a daily event.  Most of our acts are local or have local ties to the area. 95% are from Florida.” “We also have some amazing entertainment at Little Jim. We have music daily and twice a day on Saturdays & Sundays. Some of our favorites are Aquinas from Melbourne Beach and the Leafy Greens out of Jupiter. We also have our Own Live Bait (Will & Dave) from Ft Pierce. Our entertainment calendar is located on our website.” The Leafy Greens Band at Little Jim Bait & Tackle Can you tell us more about the Banquet Room for private events at Cobb’s Landing? “Our private room upstairs seats 65 with a full bar and restrooms. We are booked 75% of the year with weddings, rehearsal dinners, bridal & baby showers, business meetings, and birthday celebrations.” What about the actual bait and tackle aspect of Little Jim? I’m sure it is a popular spot for local fishermen and tourists before going out. “We have an array of Live Bait (Shrimp, Pin Fish, Pig Fish, croakers) along with frozen bait. We also carry everything you need to load up your tackle box if you forgot anything from hooks, Mono & fluorocarbon, rod & reel combos, and, of course, sunglasses and sunscreen because we always seem to forget that at home.” I saw there is a campaign to save Little Jim from redevelopment in the area. Can you tell us more about that and how people can help? “We are trying to get the site listed on the Historical registry.   It served as a guard shack for the Navy in the 40’s, and we believe the spot should always remain the same. People can vote on change.org .” How has Fintech helped with managing your alcohol program? “It has streamlined our invoices, especially with having them in a digital format and being able to track your credits and pricing to keep on top of today’s rising prices. I find the real-time banking activity and managing your credits the most useful because, in this business, every dollar counts in managing your cash flow and ensuring that you know what product is coming in and out of your store.” We thank Donna for her time and for the chance to speak about Cobb’s Landing and Little Jim Bait & Tackle.

The restaurant has three dining options. Besides indoor dining which lacks atmosphere, there is tiki dining undercover and outfitted with breezy fans as well as true outdoor dining where you can dine with your dog. I am all about al fresco dining, especially when the atmosphere is rustic and open, and the view is water with a lovely marina. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. As we perused the menu, a duo with guitars pleasantly strummed in the background. We shared the Garlic and Herb Wood Grilled Summer Artichokes ($14). We dipped the tender, lemony, pulpy artichokes in Cajun remoulade which was a spicy, pickle aioli. Our artichoke-authority-friends declared them to be the “best ever.” We also shared the Caribbean Chicken Wings ($14). The wings were grilled, not fried, so they were not greasy. The Caribbean spices infused the chicken with sweet flavor. The Island Aioli (which tasted like Chipotle Ranch) was a great accompaniment. The Bourbon Street Gumbo ($6 cup and $8 bowl) was nicely spicy with plentiful chunks of crab, shrimp, andouille sausage, okra, and the “Louisiana Holy Trinity” of onions, peppers and celery. My husband ordered the Southwest Steak Salad ($22). The beef tenderloin was medium rare, tender, and full of wood-grilled flavor. The greens were dressed with roasted corn and black bean salsa, fire roasted peppers, Cotjita cheese (a hard-Mexican cheese), and chili pepper ranch dressing. One friend chose the fresh catch of the day sandwich which was cobia ($24) caught in Jupiter. Fish is offered blackened, grilled, sautéed or fried. The generous piece of cobia was succulent, firm, and juicy. The other friend ordered the Artisan BLT ($14). Artisan is not a typical adjective used to describe a BLT. However, its use is proper for this well-crafted, hearty French toast version.The thickly sliced Parmesan and chive sour dough bread was dipped in a batter, griddled, and piled with avocado and apple-wood smoked bacon. The sandwich was a delicious sweet and savory creation. I ordered the Kennebunkport Surf & Turf Burger ($19). The butter poached and wood grilled Maine lobster claws plus a whipped goat cheese and mustard aioli sat on top of a thick, yummy, perfectly cooked burger. The lobster was decadent and rich. All sandwiches are served with crispy skinny herb and Parmesan fries, house potato chips or coleslaw. For dessert, we shared the Key Lime Pie ($8). The plate was decorated with icing and sugar crystals which made a beautiful presentation. The filling had a nice tangy flavor and texture, but the graham cracker crust was too thick in relation to the filling. Cobb’s Landing's food  is artisanal, creative, locally-sourced and fresh. Clearly, the chef enjoys the craft of originality in creating good food. Don’t worry if it’s one of those all too common rainy days. You can sit outside but undercover and enjoy one of their specialty drinks.
