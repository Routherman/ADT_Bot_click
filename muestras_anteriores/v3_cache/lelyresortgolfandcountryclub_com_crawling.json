Flamingo Island is an intriguing public course and the only Robert Trent Jones Sr. design in the area. Also a public course, the Mustang is a challenging Lee Trevino design, also the only one around. Lely is located on the Southeast side of Naples, and it is home to the Edison College Naples Campus. The third course, The Classics, is surrounded by beautiful subtropical woodlands. This 18-hole championship course features tree-lined fairways and gentle contours. Less formal than the other two courses, the natural setting of The Classics is as serene and peaceful. Gary Player designed this masterpiece to be the epitome of a club player’s golf course. It requires planning and strategy backed up by the solid golf skills that characterize a true club player. In addition to golf, homeowners have access to world-class amenities at the Players Club & Spa. Also, a 30,000 square foot clubhouse with multiple dining options from casual to formal. Additionally, members seeking outdoor activities will enjoy a large lagoon pool with a waterfall, 13 Har-Tru Tennis Courts, 4 Bocce Ball Courts and 2 Pickleball Courts. For those interested in wellness, there is a 6,000 square foot fitness center and spa offering a wide array of services.
