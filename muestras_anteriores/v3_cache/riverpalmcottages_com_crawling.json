Many of them have been part of our Staff for years. Most importantly, they share a love for ‘Camp’ Camp — and the collective ability to know just how to make sure you have the best time ever! meet our owners & directors Kerry Riffle (he/him; Owner/Director, Woodville, OH) was severely traumatized by five days at Camp Storer during his sixth-grade spring break. However, the memory of his hunky cabin counselor and his inexplicable desire to see the state of Maine prevailed when he saw an ad for the very first year of ‘Camp’ Camp in The Advocate back in 1997. Kerry has held various positions at Camp since then, including Theatre Instructor (1997-1998), Rainbow Group Leader (1997-2000), Staff Training Supervisor & Programming Coordinator (2000-2004), and Assistant Director for Operations (2005). A member of Camp’s Steering Committee from 1999-2005, he was asked by ‘Camp’ Camp’s founder Bill Cole to assume ownership of Camp in 2006. So, while his dream was always to have his own theatre company, Kerry nonetheless has happily spent the past 19 years the proud owner of a fabulous LGBTQ+ summer camp instead! Originally from northwest Ohio where he was also a theatre major at Bowling Green State University, Kerry moved to Chicago in 1988 to pursue a theatre career, relocating to Boston (meh) in 1999 and New York City (loved it!) in 2001. Hoping that living somewhere with a more reasonable cost of living would allow him to focus more on ‘Camp’ Camp after years of juggling full-time jobs with Camp responsibilities, he left New York in 2016. After an extended stay in both Maine and Ohio, a friend’s offer of a cheap place to live in Hollywood enticed him out to California in March of 2017, allowing him to spend the worst of the COVID pandemic in all that glorious Southern California sunshine. When family matters called in late 2021, he returned to the small Ohio town where he grew up, concurrently (and ironically) finding himself remotely employed by the very same Manhattan law firm where he had worked for most of his 15 years in New York City. Camp 2025 will mark his 26th season with ‘Camp’ Camp, after also designing/managing two years of virtual Camp programming in 2020 and 2021. (Stupid COVID.) His 28-year tenure at Camp gives him the dubious distinction of being the only person left who has experienced ‘Camp’ Camp every year since its inception in 1997. He has seen and heard a lot. A lot. Michelle Rediker (she/her; Associate Director, Boston, MA) thrived as a camper at Girl Scout Camp Natarswi, at the Southern Gate of Maine’s stunning Baxter State Park in the ’80’s. Though she heard about ‘Camp’ Camp in its earliest years, Michelle kept denying the longing in her heart to return summer camp. (One of her life’s biggest life regrets.) In the summer of 2009, Michelle finally decided to take the plunge — and she’s only missed one year of ‘Camp’ Camp since then! As a Camper her first two summers at Camp, Michelle spent so much time in the lake, Camp’s Waterfront Director decided she might as well just hire Michelle as a Lifeguard if she insisted on being there all the time anyway. And thus it began: Michelle was a full-time lifeguard on Camp’s Waterfront Staff from 2012 to 2016, then split her time between the waterfront and Rainbow Group Leader from 2017 to 2019. She “retired” from the Waterfront Staff in 2022, when she served as both a Rainbow Group Leader and their Team Leader before being invited to become Assistant Director for Camp 2023. Michelle’s career outside of Camp centers on fundraising. After graduating from the University of Maine, she worked at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, starting as the receptionist and moving up through the organization in a variety of positions — pretty much doing everything but litigation! In her last role at GLAD, she was responsible for their annual fundraising events. After realizing she didn’t quite possess the Fabulous Gene such a position required and instead preferred the data side of fundraising, she acquired her Client/Server Certificate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Michelle then began a short tour of Boston’s religious institutions, a funny thing for a social justice warrior atheist. Nonetheless, it stuck, and it’s been a match made in Heaven! When COVID-19 struck, Michelle – knowing the value of Camp as a community institution and being committed to Camp’s future – utilized her extensive fundraising background to organize a GoFundMe campaign that was instrumental in ‘Camp’ Camp surviving those uncertain days of no in-person Camp (translation: little revenue) but ongoing expenses. In her spare time, Michelle has mentored LGBTQ+ youth living in foster care and fights for Democracy. She loves to travel, especially if it gives her the chance to go diving. In 2014 for her sabbatical, she traveled to Thailand, where she perfected her SCUBA skills and worked on a reef restoration project. Michelle, her wife and adorable pup live surrounded by bucolic farm and conservation land near Boston. Betsy Orr (she/her; Owner/Purchasing & Inventory Manager, Portland, ME) is a wicked-local, lifelong resident of Maine and is uniquely qualified to be a long-term owner of ‘Camp’ Camp: until her move to Portland in 2013, she could see Camp from her house — although she did have to travel to Boston Pride to find out about it. Betsy first came to ‘Camp’ Camp as a Driver in 2003 and later became a Rainbow Group Leader. When Kerry asked her to become his business partner in 2009, she said “Yes!” before she really had time to consider what she was doing, and she served as Associate Director from 2009-2023 before assuming her current role in 2024. Camp 2025 will be Betsy’s 21st summer at ‘Camp’ Camp, and, while she has loved every minute of the journey thus far, she’s excited that her current role as Purchasing & Inventory Manager allows her to spend the week of Camp frolicking full-time with the other Campers. Having spent much of her youth at her grandmother’s camp, Betsy has always been well-equipped to spend her summers playing with a bunch of queers in the Maine woods. To know her is to know that she’s really just an overgrown kid. ‘Camp’ Camp founder Bill Cole gave her the nickname “Plays Well With Others,” which is a pretty accurate description, as her constant smile, quick wit, and colorful (ahem) language render her easily approachable at ‘Camp’ Camp. Betsy recently retired after many years of avoiding lesbian stereotypes as a PE and Health teacher, though she finds working with ‘Camp’ Campers to be oddly similar to working with the Middle School students she used to teach when ‘Camp’ Camp wasn’t in session. Betsy can always be heard before she is seen—which gives you ample notice to turn and run or to stop and talk. meet our executive staff Anne Diehl (she/her; Registrar/Executive Assistant, Washington, DC) never went to sleepaway camp as a kid, but always was fascinated with what it might be like, even as an adult, so after a rough year coming out, she jumped at the chance to attend ‘Camp’ Camp in 2019. Camp was everything she dreamed it would be and more — Anne loved the atmosphere and all the fun activities, like kayaking, Broadway dance, and stained glass, but was blown away by the community, as everyone she met was kind, friendly, and deeply supportive of her in her coming out experience. New friends also watched with knowing smiles as Anne fell for a fellow first-year Camper named Kate, who is now Anne’s wife (and Camp’s Dining Hall Manager). While Anne cannot guarantee that your future partner is waiting for you at ‘Camp’ Camp, she suggests you should probably come to Camp anyway, just in case. Anne loved being a full-time camper so much her first two summers, she decided to join the Staff as Executive Assistant for Camp’s 2023 season and then became Registrar as well in 2024. She also was a key member of the Transition Team that worked to move Camp to its new, current location in 2024. Anne loves working on the behind the scenes details and logistics of Camp, as, for her, it extends the excitement of ‘Camp’ Camp all year long. Outside of Camp, Anne works in mental health research, and her favorite activity is doing cozy craft projects while sitting next to Kate. They are currently crocheting a very ugly blanket together. Erich Nobis (he/him; Operations Manager; Armington, IL) marks his sixth season at Camp in 2025, though technically he should be a seventh year Camp veteran: he first attended Camp in 2017 as part of the Beverage and Maintenance & Logistics Teams, rejoining those teams again when he returned to Camp in 2019. (He strongly recommends to “never miss ‘Camp’ Camp for a boy!”) This summer will be Erich’s second consecutive season as Camp’s Operations Manager, after his initial stints on Camp’s Beverage and Maintenance & Logistics Teams, another year on the Maintenance & Logistics Team and as Assistant Evening Social Event Manager in 2022, and as Assistant Operations Manager in 2023. A life-long outdoorsman, Erich caught the camp bug as a kid hiking with his parents, later attending and counseling at performing arts summer camps in central Illinois. Erich has a background in maintenance and logistics operations and is currently a Technology Analyst in corporate event planning. On practically any decent weather day, you can find him escaping corporate life in his chicken coop, one of several garden beds, or hiking and foraging in the local nature area. Kat Torres Radisic ( they/them; Outreach Manager, Jamaica Plain, MA) initially won a free week at ‘Camp’ Camp as the winner of Camp’s 2023 Best Time Ever Giveaway. Now, they are preparing for their third year at ‘Camp’ Camp, serving their second year as both the Camp’s new Outreach Manager and a Rainbow Group Leader! Kat didn’t start their camp journey as a camper; instead, they jumped straight into action as a counselor and program director for four summers at a camp for people with disabilities in Wisconsin. Now that they’ve discovered a summer camp for LGBTQ+ adults, they are excited to encourage more queer individuals to embrace the ‘Camp’ Camp experience. Their primary goal is to bring greater age and gender diversity to Camp, making it an even more vibrant and inclusive community for everyone. When Kat isn’t busy advocating for accessible public transportation as a Community Organizer at a disability rights nonprofit, you can find them pursuing their granola-human dreams outdoors or enjoying live music. Fun fact: Kat’s favorite ‘Camp’ Camp activity is the morning silent disco. Just imagine starting your day with a dance party — what a way to set the tone for a fantastic day (whether you’re at Camp or not)! Kayla Pekkala (she/her; Social Media & e-Commerce Manager, Chicago, IL) grew up near Portland, Oregon and started attending camp at age 11. Each year she would count down the days until it started (to be honest that hasn’t changed at all: she still counts down the days until ‘Camp’ Camp, but like who doesn’t do that?!) attending as a camper, then a counselor-in-training, and ending as a counselor until she started college. Since graduating with her Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Art Institute of Portland, Kayla has spent the last 15 years in the design, marketing, social media, and e-commerce fields. She’s designed and developed toys & games that have been in several stores you’ve probably heard of, including Target, Costco, and Five Below, to name a few. Presently, she’s the owner and designer of Tiny Werewolves , a stationery and custom art business. However, as the years moved forward, Kayla has always felt there was something missing: the campfires and s’mores, the friendship bracelets, the late-late-late-night laughs, feeling like you just belong somewhere… and then after nearly two decades she (finally!) discovered ‘Camp’ Camp, attending as a Camper during Camp’s 2023 season. Once Kayla arrived, in true extrovert fashion, she wasted no time getting to know fellow Campers, both new and returning, and knew immediately she wanted to be more involved! She’s very excited to bring her vast creative background, knowledge, and experience to Camp’s Executive Staff for the second year in a row with great hopes that her fresh perspectives and ideas will help ‘Camp’ Camp continue to grow and thrive in the years to come. Back home in Chicago, where Kayla lives with her wife (whom you’ll never see at Camp, as it’s just not her thing) and their two adopted scruffy pups, Tater Tot (“Tate”) and Casserole (“Cassie”), she is known as the ‘mom friend’, as she’s always prepared for everything with the schedule and snacks in hand. She also gives great pep talks if you’re in need of some good vibes! Kevin Joest (he/him; Staffing Manager/Beverage Manager, Louisville, KY) is a musician/composer, woodworker, knitter, poet, cook, amateur mixologist, and dreamer. He grew up in Kentucky, which he feels is a good place to be from, and recently returned to his native Louisville, after stints in Nashville, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Growing up, he never really went to summer camp, but his family went camping and sailing often, so he’s no stranger to the woods and what can happen in them. Now a city boy, he spends his days woodworking for a custom cabinetry company and his nights making board games and other wood art, composing music, knitting hats & scarves, cooking food, and traveling. Having spent many years waiting tables, bartending, and smiling at folks over great food and cocktails, Kevin was excited to put all that experience to use as part of the Camp Staff  when he was initially hired back in 2017 as Camp’s first-ever Beverage Manager. Having exceeded Kerry & Betsy’s expectations for the position during his first three years, he (and his position) became a member of Camp’s Executive Staff beginning in 2022. Kevin will be serving as Camp’s new Staffing Manager for the 2025 season, switching gears for the week of Camp when he’ll continuing to manage Camp’s Beverage Team, leading the charge to help keep Campers hydrated during the day and feeling good at night. At Camp, if he’s not kayaking on the pond or sliding down the water slide, you’ll usually find him behind the bar or in his short shorts filling up coolers in the beautiful Maine sun. Richard Harmer (he/him; Transportation Manager, Sainte-Julienne, QC) currently teaches English and Business Communication in his adopted province of Quebec. A California native, he fell in love with the camp experience when he was 10 and attended Camp Bluff Lake in the mountains of Southern California. In order to go to subsequent YMCA camps, he sold candied peanuts door to door. He also attended religious-oriented camps where he performed in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . As soon as he found out about ‘Camp’ Camp in 2012, he couldn’t wait to attend. He first attended Camp as a Camper in 2013, then joined the Staff as a Driver when he next attended Camp in 2015. Richard continued as a Driver until 2019 when he first assumed his current role of Transportation Manager, tackling the tricky logistics around getting all Campers & Staff safely to and from Camp from the Portland’s airport and bus/train stations. When not huddled over his computer at Camp figuring out which Camper needs to be on which van, he enjoys making tie-die shirts each year, as well as attending cooking classes and meditation sessions. Sometimes called “Daddy Richard,” “Banana Richard” (don’t ask), or even “Sh!t Richard” (you can ask about that one), you’ll surely get to know him at least a little bit at Camp. Robin Benton (she/her; Risk Manager, Jamaica Plain, MA) , an EMT, RN, and Professor of Aquatic Management at Salem State University in Massachusetts, has been providing aquatic and safety training to camps, schools, and recreation programs from Pennsylvania to Alaska for more than 25 years. She originally served as Hiking Instructor at ‘Camp’ Camp when she first attended in 2006, later moving into Risk Management and serving in her current position as Lead Risk Manager since 2009.  An author, nationally recognized speaker, and expert witness, Robin has held numerous leadership positions with the National Recreation & Park Association, the National Conference on Race & Ethnicity in Higher Education, Swingtime Boston, and other agencies. An avid outdoor and motorcycle enthusiast, Robin has ridden and camped through much of North America, so, while many people consider ‘Camp’ Camp to be on the rustic side, it always feels like a spa vacation to her! Basically, Robin is just a Camper with a day job. Her other passions include gardening, ballroom dance, and fostering dogs. Scott Surette (he/him; Camp Store Manager, St. Petersburg, FL ) was referred to ‘Camp’ Camp by a close friend, initially attending as a Camper in 2013 and 2014. His 17 years of experience in retail management came in handy when he was asked to serve as Interim Camp Store Manager in 2015, his first year as part of the Camp Staff. He’s worked as a Camp Store Assistant almost every year since then (2017 was sadly a Camp-free year for Scott), returning as Camp Store Manager again in 2022. Although Scott never went to summer camp as a kid, he always enjoyed camping with friends as a teen in his native New Hampshire. Like many of our Campers, Scott says it’s the great people he continues to meet at ‘Camp’ Camp that has kept him coming back for so many years. Currently a contact lens fitting consultant, Scott has also served on several committees for non-profits over the years, including MoveOn.org and The Southern New Hampshire HIV/AIDS Task Force. In his spare time, he enjoys attending concerts and writing and is planning to publish his first book this year. Bill Cole (he/him; Founder, Colrain, MA) started ‘Camp’ Camp a couple of months after he came out at age 49 in 1996. His goal was to create a safe place for gay and lesbian adults (he didn’t know then about bisexual, transgender, and queer people, so other letters were added later) to enjoy the out-of-doors and a variety of activities just like the summer camps he wanted to like, but was never comfortable in, when he was a kid himself. He wanted to give people the luxury of time and the chance to get beyond first appearances to the possibility of real friendship.  The first year of ‘Camp’ Camp in 1997, 88 people attended — this in the days before most people had email and Facebook’s founder was in high school — and about two-thirds of them were part of the Camp staff! In 2006, Kerry and Susan “Clink” Clinkenbeard took over — with Betsy subsequently replacing Clink as Associate Director in 2009. Bill feels that founders may be overrated and says, “It takes a different skill set, but not a lesser skill set to continue to foster and grow a business. [Kerry, Clink, and Betsy] deserve enormous credit for all [they] have done to keep Camp thriving. I admire [them all] very much.” socialize Bluesky Email Facebook Instagram YouTube buzz The people and the activities were the best. Everyone was so friendly and open. I just met some amazing people… Jordan B. (he/him), Halifax, W. Yorkshire, UK Camp has changed the way I feel about myself.

Anne D. (she/her), Washington, DC ‘Camp’ Camp has woken up the joys of living, of experiencing life, of socializing with people, all sorts of innocence lost with age and work… Kat L.

(he/him), North Easton, MA I return to Camp because it’s a week I can recharge, cut off, and be in a puddle of love for the week. Richard H. (he/him), Sainte-Julienne, QC This place changed my life.

(he/him), Los Angeles, CA I didn’t think I’d get such a substantial emotional return on this investment but this space has really helped me learn to love myself more. Olivia R. (she/her), Lancaster, PA I love ‘Camp’ Camp! The people, the beautiful place, the amazing sense of community, the fun activities, it’s all a wonderful mix that creates one of the best vacations I’ve ever had. Elaine B. (she/her), Oakland, CA I’ve traveled a lot, and I’ve never found another place as warm and welcoming as ‘Camp’ Camp; not even close! David P. (he/him), Camillus, NY For the first time in my 44 years, I found a place, a people, where I belong. … I march to a different drum. But at ‘Camp’ Camp, EVERYONE does. We are all beautiful, loving misfits, and I was seen, truly seen, for the first time ever. You can go your whole life without ever finding that. Aletha G. (she/her), Colonial Beach, VA …I gained a community of loving, caring, generous people to share the rest of the journey with.  The comradery, the laughs, the tears… I could never have predicted or expected to be loved and accepted without condition.

(she/her), Ann Arbor, MI The summer camp experience itself was everything I hoped it would be, and the people were beyond my wildest expectations. I have never felt so free. B B. (they/them), Gallatin Gateway, MT Ever since I set foot at Camp in 2023, I knew this was going to be home for me.

(they/them), East Boston, MA I was really able to just relax and be social when I wanted to and be in solitude when I needed. No pressure to do anything. All the smiles and hellos and laughing. Something I miss in everyday life. Rick R. (he/him), Sacramento, CA This is the most incredible creation of community and culture I believe exists on this planet, and that’s not just for queer people.  I can’t imagine cultivating this type of non-judgmental, loving and edifying space anywhere else. Chris D. (he/him), Arlington, MA Camp simply recenters me. Makes me remember what’s important in life. Doug S. (he/him), Arleta, CA Camp has become a yearly necessity, like taxes but far more pleasurable! Thom H. (he/him), Salem, MA I have never experienced such a sense of community, support, love, candor, and friendship. The queer community and the larger world can be devastatingly brutal at times especially for those of us who already suffer from a lack of confidence or self-worth. I will be forever grateful for finding my kind. Sean B. (he/him), Reisterstown, MD It truly is an incredible week: a time to connect with old friends, to make new ones, and to take a breath and go with the flow. A choose your own adventure! Dustin F.

(she/her), Mashpee, MA …as an adult man living my truth without the fear of judgment was the best thing I’ve ever experienced. Jeffrey W. (he/him), Sparks, NV I’m close to my biological family but Campers are my chosen family, however odd and quirky. Every year I look forward to my annual family reunion. But what is becoming more important for me is how Camp gives space to all those loving, odd, quirky folks who find their way to Camp and are finally able to be in such a loving, fun-loving, accepting space. Ann G. (she/her), Topsham, ME It’s one of the few places I feel most seen for who I am and valued for it in a way I don’t feel valued for it in the world all the time. It lifts me up for the rest of the year. Jon M. (he/him), Brooklyn, NY All the evening activities were outstanding. So much fun! Glynn G.

(he/him), Washington, DC It is a week where your face hurts when you leave because you laughed and smiled so much.

(she/her), Birdsboro, PA I had a truly life-changing time at Camp last year. The warmth, friendliness, and complete lack of cliqueishness was incredible and addictive. Zach B.

Finley W. (they/them), Yorktown, VA I loved having an immediate and deep connection to all Campers, and the sense of family that was ever-present.

Jason S. (he/him), Brooklyn, NY I really found incredible friendships this year. Almost as soon as Camp started, I found a really solid group of new friends in my cabin that felt like I’d known them forever (in addition to my friends from last year!) We laughed, cried, danced, jammed, explored, shared secrets, and supported each other unconditionally throughout the week. My heart felt so full. I can’t wait to see them again next year! Amber B. (she/her), Lexington, KY … I truly feel wanted & like I am part of this family. Camp has enveloped me in love and shows me that I am valuable just as I am – no strings attached. Collette B.

I’ve never felt so self-confident in my entire life, because the openness of the Campers was so absolute. Kevin J. (he/him), Louisville, KY … I truly feel wanted & like I am part of this family. Camp has enveloped me in love and shows me that I am valuable just as I am – no strings attached. Collette B. (she/her), Waxhaw, NC …I gained a community of loving, caring, generous people to share the rest of the journey with.  The comradery, the laughs, the tears… I could never have predicted or expected to be loved and accepted without condition. Angela F. (she/her), Phoenix, AZ Totally fabulous. …The spirit of Camp is so joyful and fun and silly and accepting all at once. Daphne B. (she/her), Mashpee, MA It’s one of the few places I feel most seen for who I am and valued for it in a way I don’t feel valued for it in the world all the time. It lifts me up for the rest of the year. Jon M. (he/him), Brooklyn, NY It is a week where your face hurts when you leave because you laughed and smiled so much. It is a week that invigorates you and makes you want to carry the acceptance, happiness, honesty and caring to those in our outside worlds.  … I always leave ‘Camp’ Camp feeling like there is hope that the world can become a better place… Mary Ellen M. (she/her), Birdsboro, PA Camp has become a yearly necessity, like taxes but far more pleasurable! Thom H. (he/him), Salem, MA For the first time in my 44 years, I found a place, a people, where I belong. … I march to a different drum. But at ‘Camp’ Camp, EVERYONE does. We are all beautiful, loving misfits, and I was seen, truly seen, for the first time ever. You can go your whole life without ever finding that. Aletha G. (she/her), Colonial Beach, VA I fell in love with the whole ‘Camp’ Camp community, my new queer family. Noam A.
