Barista Parlor owner and founder Andy Mumma, Isle of Printing founder Bryce McCloud and longtime Husk Nashville bar manager Mike Wolf have taken over the former Bar Luca space, to create a neo-tiki bar with a \"Jetsons\" meets \"Polynesian Pop\" vibe. The bar itself is trimmed out in bamboo, but the giant robot hovering over it and the sci-fi theming may scare away those looking for a more traditional tiki space. Still, Chopper has a serious rum collection at hand and their cocktails look to be on-point. Details Type Bar & Restaurant Phone (615) 348-8156 Address Nashville, Tennessee, United States Closed?

Started with their Mai-Tai which was very good, then had the Tiger Milk off the holiday menu which was delicious!  Took a break and got some Burria Tacos from the food truck outside, then finished up with a Bot Barrel and a Dopamine cocktail.  Not a bad drink in the bunch.  All were very good, but my favorites were probably the Tiger Milk and the Dopamine. The Tiki Barber – 8 Mar 2024 Great spot. Max was bartending both Friday and Sunday when we went ( he's a phenomenal bartender) cocktails were great, decor was cool and we meet up with local Tennessee Tikiphiles for a friend's birthday. It was a great trip/experience Cape FM – 6 Sept 2019 I like the Robot Tiki concept.  When I went in 2019 it was quiet and pretty empty.  I went back in 2023 and it was crowded and tough to get a seat with a popular food truck outside. Drinks I had in 2019:\n1) Jet Pilot - great taste overall, not strong, cinnamon very pleasant, nice clean finish\n2) Robo Zombie - bright, also not strong, pleasing tabithablanken – 3 Apr 2022 Went right after I dropped my stuff off at the Gaylord Hotel for my Nashville vacation during QuadA. I was really impressed with how long the fires remained lit in the drinks. Unfortunately their spring seasonal menu was too intriguing and I ordered four, plus the bartenders did shots with me. This did not end well later at the hotel. But at the time it was amazing. They had a drink with a garam masala or something similar that was one of the most interesting tiki drinks I've ever had. I got the little head mug and dropped it at the hotel atrium trying to take a selfie with a waterfall. It now sits in the Enchanted Tibby Room as a reminder of the dangers that these drinks hold. TikiDeathMetal – Date: Unknown Interesting take on a tiki bar. The drinks were strong and the decor was enjoyable. The taco truck out front was a nice touch. DeltaTikiphile – 13 July 2025 Is Chopper a Tiki Bar??  I'm still not 100% sure, but they have some of the best Tiki drinks I've had anywhere.  Their Mai Tai (always a good starting point) is better than on point.  Their addition of Creole Shrubb in lieu of Curacao really makes it a Mai Tai that tastes like it should - but somehow better.  To top it off, it's served in a robot \"rum barrel\" that I took home with me to add to my burgeoning collection.  Their \"Fountain of Muses\" is a cachaca, rum, & sherry concoction served up in a coupe that looks and tastes like Tiki perfection.  I wanted to taste my way through the menu, but I'll have to do that on another visit.  It's a great pseudo-tiki bar, filled with the best Tiki drinks - but the \"escapism\" escaped when the robots came in.  Chopper gets bonus points for actually serving drinks in branded mugs and glassware - a feat that fewer Tiki bars are attempting these days - and Chopper prints it right on the menu: \"these glasses/mugs are for sale, but if you steal them we will charge your card $100 ea.\"  Good for them. Chopper is a GREAT bar, and is probably a great Tiki bar, but my gatekeeping instincts cringe at the liberties they have taken.  It is said that the lighting makes it better at night.  I'd like to see that for myself, as we were there during the day.  They have huge garage doors (that they open during fair weather) that flood daylight into the space during the day.  This is another cringe point for the Delta Tikiphile. Anyway, don't let my lukewarm review keep you away.  Their cocktails rival the best I've had at Smuggler's Cove, Secret Island, and 4 Kahunas, but I just wish they'd sprinkle in a little more escapism into their robot mix. DRock – Date: Unknown Awesome Mai tai. Mexican food was served from food  truck outside. Different robot tiki atmosphere.
