Both the North and South course proudly hold a Golf Digest 4 ½-star ranking. The spectacular layout of both courses and the  grandfather oak trees lead you to believe the courses have been here for decades. Rated #16 Best in the State of Florida, Lake Jovita truly is unique. The South course, designed by PGA Tour star Tom Lehman, boasts the largest elevation change of any hole in Florida (hole #11). The course features tight fairways lined with majestic oak trees and many natural water hazards. Due to the South course's challenging play and natural beauty, it has hosted The PGA Tour Qualifying School since 2000. In addition, each year the South course is a US Open and US Women's Open qualifying site and is also home to the University of South Florida Division One Spring Invitational. The North course is the perfect complement to its sister South course. Designed by renowned golf course architect, Kurt Sandness, the North course has a longer layout that features bunker-lined, undulating fairways surrounded by natural Florida fauna and wildlife. It is ranked as the 16th best course in Florida by Golfweek magazine. The North course is a favorite host\nsite to several Florida State Golf Association championships.

From the Editor In 2021, Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak were named joint leads of JPMorgan's consumer operations, which accounts for nearly 40% of the company's profits. Lake first joined JPMorgan in 1999. She served as the Chief Financial Officer from 2013-2019 and the CEO of Consumer Lending from 2019 to 2021. Piepszak started at bank in 1994. She was its CFO from 2019 to 2021 and before that served as the CEO of Card Services, CEO of Business Banking and CFO for Mortgage Banking.

Both the North and South course proudly hold a Golf Digest 4 ½-star ranking. The spectacular layout of both courses and the  grandfather oak trees lead you to believe the courses have been here for decades. Rated #16 Best in the State of Florida, Lake Jovita truly is unique. The South course, designed by PGA Tour star Tom Lehman, boasts the largest elevation change of any hole in Florida (hole #11). The course features tight fairways lined with majestic oak trees and many natural water hazards. Due to the South course's challenging play and natural beauty, it has hosted The PGA Tour Qualifying School since 2000. In addition, each year the South course is a US Open and US Women's Open qualifying site and is also home to the University of South Florida Division One Spring Invitational. The North course is the perfect complement to its sister South course. Designed by renowned golf course architect, Kurt Sandness, the North course has a longer layout that features bunker-lined, undulating fairways surrounded by natural Florida fauna and wildlife. It is ranked as the 16th best course in Florida by Golfweek magazine. The North course is a favorite host\nsite to several Florida State Golf Association championships.

Both the North and South course proudly hold a Golf Digest 4 ½-star ranking. The spectacular layout of both courses and the grandfather oak trees lead you to believe the courses have been here for decades. Rated #16 Best in the State of Florida, Lake Jovita truly is unique. The South course, designed by PGA Tour star Tom Lehman, boasts the largest elevation change of any hole in Florida (hole #11). The course features tight fairways lined with majestic oak trees and many natural water hazards. Due to the South course's challenging play and natural beauty, it has hosted The PGA Tour Qualifying School since 2000. In addition, each year the South course is a US Open and US Women's Open qualifying site and is also home to the University of South Florida Division One Spring Invitational. The North course is the perfect complement to its sister South course. Designed by renowned golf course architect, Kurt Sandness, the North course has a longer layout that features bunker-lined, undulating fairways surrounded by natural Florida fauna and wildlife. It is ranked as the 16th best course in Florida by Golfweek magazine. The North course is a favorite host site to several Florida State Golf Association championships.
