Here are our memories of our first food jobs. By Bon Appétit May 2, 2014 Associate restaurant editor Julia Kramer, back in her scoop shop days. Julia Kramer Perhaps it comes as no surprise that a lot of our staff started their careers by working as dishwashers, bread delivery guys, waitresses, or beach-shack burger flippers . We've known the full range of the hospitality industry and have seen some crazy stuff go down in the back of the house. And we're grateful for that experience—it informs our writing still. From our editor-in-chief to our test kitchen editors, check out our memories of our first food jobs, below. “ I was a dishwasher at Swensen's ice cream in Mazza Gallerie mall in Washington, DC, when I was 16. Weirdly, I kind of loved it. I had the dishwasher room to myself and I could play whatever music I wanted. Just outside the room was a giant pile of bacon that the cooks would use for BLTs and club sandwiches, so I always had a snack at arm's reach. Unlimited sundaes. And really cute waitresses. Basically, everything a teenage boy could want.” — Adam Rapoport, editor-in-chief “For my college summers I was a 'Bread Guy.' That meant that I woke up at 3am, drove to the Country Kitchen Bread terminal, and loaded a (literal) ton of bread onto my truck to deliver to stores and lobster shacks on the Maine coast. That lobster roll you ate on vacation? I delivered the hot dog bun that kept it all together, along with countless loaves of squishy white bread (we used to see how small you could compress a loaf—anything larger than a baseball and you weren't really trying), hamburger buns, and ‘Texas Toast.’ I still get flashbacks to the overpowering scent of yeast in the trucks whenever I walk into a bakery. The upsides of the job: it paid a lot. The downside? Getting up at 3am. Not fun.” — Scott DeSimon, deputy editor Sophomore year of high school, I was in a phase of my life during which my primary interests were listening to live Phish and trying to not get questioned by the police while \"chilling\" around a bonfire on the freezing Lake Michigan beach. Also my most frequently used word at the time was \"chilling.\" So when Ben & Jerry's opened in my suburb, I obviously wanted to work there. Before my first day of training, I wrote each Ben & Jerry's flavor on a flashcard and memorized each one's ingredients. After two weeks, almost every other kid who'd been hired with me either quit or was fired, and the owners promoted me to Assistant Manager. (I was 15.) I was sure then that working at Ben & Jerry's was the best job I would ever have, and more than a decade later, I was right. —Julia Kramer, associate restaurant editor “When I was 15, I worked at Jamba Juice (store #28 Canoga Park, sup!). My favorite part was that I worked with all my best friends and made enough money to buy gas for my crappy car. My least favorite part was having to yell at customers as they walked in. 'Welcome to Jamba...' someone would call, then the rest of us would have to shout 'JUICE!' and, Jesus, was it embarrassing. If we didn't, we got reprimanded. There were also the cheers for when people ordered their smoothies, but I blocked all that out.” —Alison Roman, senior associate food editor “ I drove an ice cream truck in suburban Chicago . Not only did I improve my change-making skills and the ability to drive on the right-hand side, I became a demographics master, figuring out which neighborhoods had the most generous moms (I wore my Mount Holyoke T-shirt to reassure them), targeting Little League games, etc. Too bad I ate all my profits in bomb pops and WWF bars.” —Christine Muhlke, executive editor “A friend and I were early entrepreneurs on Fishers Island, NY. We picked mussels from the rocks on the beaches & sold them from a plastic baby pool every afternoon in her front yard when we were 10 years old.” —Alex Pollack, photo director “One summer during college, I waitressed at a small chain called Steak & Brew in Riverside, CT . One time, I left my badge at home and had to borrow one from a guy who was going off-duty. His name was Courtney. This could very well have launched the name 'Courtney' as a girl's name—everyone commented on how incredibly cool and unusual my name was. Now, there are girl Courtneys everywhere.” —Chris Penberthy, research director “ I was a soda jerk at an ice cream parlor when I was 16 . It was the greatest job in the world—I was doling out little bits of happiness all day long! We had a bunch of regulars, all of whom were characters, but my favorite was this guy who used to come in, order a malted, and tell me wild tales of being in the secret service. He was Joe-ordinary looking, and I thought he was just another guy talking crazy. Until Ronald Reagan came to town for the Special Olympics: Standing behind Reagan was the malted guy, wearing G-man shades and holding one scary looking rifle. I never doubted him again!” —Greg Ferro, managing editor “Every summer during college I would return home to Oakland and work as a hostess at À Côté restaurant . Doing those summers I learned how to say naughty things in Spanish, saber Champagne bottles, and ate my weight in pommes frites . The chef and kitchen staff would call me pitufina which is the Spanish word for smurfette. I consider the staff from those summers family, and it's great to see how my connection to the restaurant world still creates opportunities for us to cross paths.” —Lilli Sherman, public relations “ I was a back-waiter at Commander’s Palace in New Orleans right after I graduated college. I wore a getup which consisted of giant men’s tuxedo pants & giant matching vest. My skills at power-walking through a crowd and folding cloth napkins into tiny fans have served me well through the years.” —Alicia Brooks, BonAppetit.com art director “ It was a catch-all position at a local country club . I was 15 and it was my first job job ever. I started on a Sunday and the manager asked me to come in at 12pm. I spent the day taking orders, serving food to members, clearing tables, and bussing back in the kitchen. 8pm rolled around and I asked the manager when she thought my shift would end (I needed to tell my mom when to pick me up!) She said, \"when the work is done.\" Before I knew it it was 10pm, I was tired and kind of traumatized. So I went back to the manager, handed in my shirt, and told her I wouldn't be returning.” —Joanna Sciarrino, assistant editor “ I was a prep cook at Justin's in Rehobeth, Maryland the summer of my 16th year. The entire kitchen staff was Spanish-speaking (and so was I), so they quickly made me the manager of the prep staff. It was amazing. I learned how to mince garlic and chop onions like a pro.” —Cristina Martinez, production director “My first food job was my first job, ever. I was 16, and it was the best (the only) retirement home in town. I was a dietary aide, which really just means 'waitress without tips .' I dove in with gumption, doing not just my side work, but everyone else’s, too (I just really loved setting tables). Even though we were serving glorified cafeteria food (and yep, sometimes puréeing it in a blender), I kind of loved getting the residents excited about what we had to offer. I also taught a dance-based exercise class for the seniors, but that’s a story for another time.” —Rochelle Bilow, writer, BonAppetit.com “The summer I turned 15 was a big one. I traveled by myself for the first time, to the University of Texas at Austin, to attend a 10-day classical piano performance workshop. When I flew home to New Jersey, my parents were waiting for me at the airport. Their big news at the gate? They had bought Oriental Yum Yum, our family friends' Chinese restaurant! Yum Yum did a brisk lunch business, but it was also open for dinner. A couple of evenings, I served as a hostess, seating guests . I remember wearing a pastel floral-print Laura Ashley dress (with the matching sash, of course). That job was short-lived, though, since I needed to focus on preparing for piano competitions while finishing up high school.” —Faye Chiu, assistant managing editor “First I was a bar back at a place called Nacho Mamas in Baltimore . It was the worst and I lasted like 5 1/2 weeks—but these two things I learned: 1) if you bang the garbage bag at the end of the alley so the rats scurry away before you have to walk down, they will eventually learn that this means food and just sit there and wait for you to serve them. 2) Don't say \"sorry\" when squeezing by somebody in a crowded bar (or train, grocery aisle, what have you). No need to apologize, just say 'excuse me' or 'pardon me.' Shortly thereafter I posted up as a server at Loco Hombre, also in Baltimore, where I was very likely the most inefficient employee they ever met. I would get distracted and chit chat with the guests rather than take orders and stuff. What can I say? I like to connect.\" —Dawn Perry, senior food editor “I was 19, and it was the summer after my freshman year at college. I worked in a national park concession stand in Stinson Beach, California . I fried burgers, fries, chicken burgers, and corn dogs. It was this really crazy mix of Sysco and Wonder Bread products, and then extraordinary produce and dairy from local farms. So while we had frozen fries, the side salads featured the most beautiful vegetables, and all our cheese was Cowgirl Creamery . I drove in every day from San Francisco on Highway 1 (a very,very curvy road), and started prep at 8 a.m. We opened at 11 and closed at 5. We catered mostly to the local surfers, and on any given weekday, I could be found catching a tan in my cut-offs and bikini top, checking out the waves in between lunch and post-surf rush. WHAT A DREAM.\" —Alfia Muzio, test kitchen contributor \" I was 15 years old, working as a waitress at an IHOP in suburban Atlanta . Like all jobs I worked before the age of 23, I only took it because a guy I liked worked there. He was great, but it was awful. Over the course of my six-month employment, all of the following happened: (1) A short-order cook was arrested for possession of marijuana after accidentally dropping weed in the pancake batter; (2) my manager was exported for being an illegal alien; (3) a hot-tempered line cook quit in the middle of a slammed brunch shift, shouting \"F*ck all 'y'all motherf*ckers!\" to everyone in the restaurant as he stormed out the door; (4) a waiter more than three times my age tried to grope me in the break room; (5) I was once left a $40 tip on a glass of milk, which the guest asked that I \"microwave until scalding\"; and (6) we ran out of pancake batter. On a Sunday morning. At the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES. I've never worked in a restaurant since.” —Ashlea Halpern, special projects editor “ I was 15 and Coldstone Creamery was all the rage so of course I wanted to work there ! The hiring process was more like an audition—we had to sing, dance and show everyone how \"quirky\" we could be. There were about 50 of us auditioning and in the end, only eight of us were picked. Working there, I gained an insane amount of arm muscle (the ice cream wasn't originally as creamy as they led everyone to believe!) and had to get on top of the counter to dance and sing every time someone left us a tip. One time, this guy left me a $500 tip which I sadly had to split with all the people working that day! I think I lasted three months before I moved onto to work at a ski shop (in Miami!).” —Elizabeth Jaime, photo assistant “In college, I worked catering jobs for the university as a server . It involved wearing black slacks (that I had to borrow from a friend—I definitely owned nothing fancier than denim) and a horrible maroon button-down that was three sizes too big. I remember very little about the job itself, but very much about the way that stiff, oversized shirt looked tucked into my (friend's) pants.” —Meryl Rothstein, senior editor “ I was holiday temporary help at Sherry Lehman from Thanksgiving to Christmas . An interesting and international group of us spent two days training, then we headed to the floor where we'd make wine recommendations. It was fun and back in the day when Sherry Lehman had the pulley system, so you would speak with the customer about which wine they would like and then send the request down and the wine would come up on the pulley.” —Frederika Brookfield, executive director, PR & Events Explore Bon Appétit Our Team People Read More Culture Why Restaurant Workers Are Trading Late Nights for Morning Runs By Sam Stone Culture From Courtside to Couch, Food Is Part of the Game By Jamila Robinson Restaurants These New Restaurants Are Waking Up the Breakfast Menu By Bon Appétit Staff & Contributors Cooking Tomatoes and Dumplings and More Recipes We Made This Week By The Bon Appétit Staff Shopping I Tried AG1’s New Formula—Here’s What You Should Know By Alaina Chou Cooking Our Ultimate Late Summer Pie Cooking Italian Grinder Salad and More Recipes We Made This Week By The Bon Appétit Staff Shopping Everything BA Editors Tried, Tasted, and Loved in August By Alaina Chou Cooking The Sky-High Salad Our Restaurant Editor Eats at Home By Elazar Sontag Shopping How Does a Meal Kit Menu Get Made?

By Kate Kassin September 14, 2022 Collage by Bon Appétit / Getty When Amanda Shulman worked as a cook at restaurants like Vetri Cucina in Philadelphia and Osteria della Brughiera in Bergamo, Italy, she rarely had a night off. “There was not much flexibility,” she says. “You’re open when you’re open and you work around the restaurant schedule.” So when Shulman opened Her Place , one of Bon Appétit’s 50 Best New Restaurants of 2022 , she didn’t want her staff to have that same experience. The Philadelphia restaurant, which turns out French and Italian cooking with Jewish flair, is closed on weekends. The small team writes the month’s schedule together, and if there are conflicting major life events, the schedule is adjusted. After a pandemic brought into sharp focus the thanklessness of working in restaurants, and the often fraught relationship between customer and staff, some new restaurants have started doing things differently. Whether by reducing hours, paring down menus, or attempting to shift the transactional nature of customer-staff relationships, restaurants are reimagining their approach. They’re insisting that their staff comes first. Instead of paying the price for these changes, restaurants like Good Good Culture Club in San Francisco and Lasita in Los Angeles have long queues for reservations and lines out the door. They’re proof that putting staff first can make the experience better for everyone. “I’d rather us be able to dictate our own role and be able to have a little more work-life balance,” says Shulman. Reservations for a table at her restaurant disappear within hours of being posted online. Focusing on staff starts with pay, according to the owners of Oakland’s Daytrip, one of Bon Appétit’s 10 Best New Restaurants of 2022. Stella Dennig and Finn Stern opened their restaurant with an equal tip pool based on a 20% service fee, significantly higher-than-average pay starting at $25 per hour, and health care benefits, funded by raising menu prices by 5% across the board. “There’s this extraordinary lack of fundamental dignity to the way work is treated in this industry,” Justine Hwang, a server at Daytrip, told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2021. “We have to live in the world that we live in, and I think the service fee and being transparent is the best we can do.” While restaurants across the country struggled in late 2021 to hire employees due to a nationwide labor shortage, Daytrip received more applications than it could handle—in a single week. “We knew if we couldn’t make a restaurant work with these things in place, it wasn’t worth it.” “You have to start from a point of paying people enough,” Dennig says. “Decisions like that are what grounded us before we opened. We knew if we couldn’t make a restaurant work with these things in place, it wasn’t worth it.” Like at Her Place, Daytrip has remained flexible with its hours. The restaurant was originally open until 10 p.m. on weekends, but shifted to a shorter workday based on staff input that a six-hour service was taxing on weekend nights. Now, the restaurant closes at 9:30 p.m. on weekends. The owners relied on team input in their decision to give all staff two weeks of vacation too: one between Christmas and New Year’s and one during the summer. “It’s not just better for them. It’s also better for us,” Dennig says. “We’ll have greater longevity if people are getting what they need—we’ve had extremely little turnover.” At Her Place, Shulman is trying to build an ecosystem that prioritizes the personal lives and schedules of her staff. There’s a staff-wide vacation every quarter. Shulman recalls that in her years as a cook, she never took paid time off. At Her Place, she says, “You always have a vacation to look forward to.” Some restaurants are also shortening their menus to ease workloads for their staff. Bird Pizzeria in Charlotte, North Carolina, serves a tight menu of plain, white, and vegan pies with assorted toppings and kale caesar salad. The restaurant opens at 4 p.m. and remains open until 8 p.m., but on busy days, you could show up at 5:30 p.m. only to discover the last pies have already been snatched up. While restaurants across the country struggled in late 2021 to hire employees, Daytrip received more applications than it could handle—in a single week. Husband-wife duo and owners Kerrel and Nkem Thompson know that more pizza would mean more money and more customers served—but keeping the bandwidth of their very small team and very small space in mind, they’ve decided to keep it simple. The limitations of a 500-square-foot kitchen and a four-person staff (themselves included) determines their output, as does the Thompsons’ dedication to being parents . “We wanted a comfortable space for the kids, instead of separating the idea of work and family life,” says Nkem. Even before the pandemic, the team at Lasa, a restaurant in Los Angeles’s Chinatown that was known for its Filipino tasting menu, envisioned opening a more casual rotisserie and natural wine bar. But the pandemic pushed co-owners Chase Valencia, Steff Barros Valencia, and chef-owner Nico de Leon to do it sooner, and they opened Lasita, one of Bon Appétit’s 50 Best New Restaurants of 2022, in the same space. Lasa’s hyper-seasonal menu created an environment where the kitchen was constantly creating new dishes and the front-of-house staff needed to memorize and explain every technique. In contrast, Lasita’s pared down service and simplified menu—with dishes like chicken inasal and pork belly lechón—has eased the strain on staff. “It allows us to have a better work-life balance,” De Leon says, “as opposed to breaking our backs to run this six-course menu.” While shortened menus and more flexible hours have a clear upside for staff, there’s another but less widely beloved shift that’s making work more sustainable for some front-of-house staff. The little scannable squares of paper known as QR code menus are perhaps the most disliked evolution in recent restaurant culture. But by some restaurant owners and staff, the QR codes aren’t seen simply as a way to automate the jobs of front-of-house workers. Instead, they serve to make interactions between staff and customers feel less transactional. “We wanted a comfortable space for the kids, instead of separating the idea of work and family life.” At Good Good Culture Club in San Francisco, one of Bon Appétit’s 50 Best New Restaurants of 2022, QR codes are at the center of every table. At Los Angeles’s Yangban Society , one of Bon Appétit’s 10 Best New Restaurants of 2022, you’ll order at the restaurant’s deli counter, but once you’re sitting at a table, you can add to your meal using a QR code menu. This avoids repeat visits to the counter and helps team members in the large restaurant space figure out which tables to send food to. And while Korean restaurant 8282 in New York hasn’t opted for a full no-contact system, scanning a QR code menu on your phone before ordering from a front-of-house worker streamlines the experience. Good Good Culture Club sees QR codes as a way to free up staff to interact with guests , while eliminating the stress of order mistakes—whether missing a modification, letting an allergy slip by, or forgetting to add on a side dish. With QR code ordering, tickets go directly to the restaurant’s point-of-sale system and on to the kitchen. “Servers can actually be more in contact with the table and guide them along,” says Good Good Culture Club co-owner Jeff Hanak. This efficiency in the ordering process goes hand in hand with a shorter dinner service, which lasts just four hours each night. Good Good Culture Club server Nora Barber doesn’t see QR codes as just another step in automating what would otherwise be a human interaction. Instead, Barber says relationships with customers are actually stronger now. “Using the QR system allows us as staff more time to be able to interact with the guests and have real conversations.” Kate Kassin writes about the latest restaurant openings and snacks we’re obsessed with and helps oversee projects like Best New Restaurants from conception to execution.
