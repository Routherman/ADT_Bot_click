You're under enough pressure without having to spend time searching online for the latest brand guidelines and assets for every platform. We've been there - we know it can be a pain! That's why we've created this resource with every key social media logo and icon in one handy place. Below are the latest official logos, icons, and brand guidelines for each platform. Plus, a quick guide to using the text versions of the icons so that you can copy and paste them into your docs: Table of Contents Standard brand guidelines for platforms The official social media logos Using text-based icons and glyps Standard brand guidelines for platforms Before using social media logos and icons, it is essential to follow the official brand guidelines set by each platform. These rules help maintain brand consistency and ensure compliance with their policies. Key guidelines for using social media logos and icons 1. Use only approved logo assets Each platform provid es official logo files that must be used as they are. Avoid: Creating custom versions of social media logos. Modifying colours, shapes, or adding effects. Using outdated or unofficial icons. 📌 Tip: Download the latest approved logo files directly from the platform’s brand resources page. 2. Use the correct colour variations Each social media platform has a distinct brand colour that must be used correctly. For example: X (Twitter) Blue differs from LinkedIn Blue and Facebook Blue. Instagram’s gradient has specific colour ratios that should not be altered. 📌 Tip: Always check the platform’s brand guidelines for the latest colour codes before using their logo. 3. Maintain clear space around the logo To ensure vis ibility, each platform requires a minimum clear space around its logo. This prevents clutter and maintains readability. Do not overlap the logo with text or images. Leave sufficient padding to separate it from other elements. 📌 Tip: Refer to each platform’s clear space requirements in their official guidelines. 4. Keep the correct shape and proportions when resizing Do not stretch, skew, or distort social media logos when resizing. Maintain the original aspect ratio to preserve brand integrity. Use \"Shift\" while resizing in design software to scale proportionally. Do not shrink below the minimum size recommended by the platform. 📌 Tip: If you need a smaller version, download the pre-approved icon sizes from the official brand assets page. 5. Acceptable ways to display social media icons There are two recommended ways to present social media icons in marketing materials: 1. With a call-to-action → Use individual platform icons alongside a direct action. Example: \"Follow us on Instagram\" or \"Add us on Snapchat.\" 2. Grouped side-by-side → Display multiple icons together to represent general social media presence. Example: A \"Follow us on social media\" section on a website or footer. 📌 Tip: Always ensure your brand remains the focus —social media icons should be secondary to your content. The official social media logos Let's take a look at the specific details for each social media network and the way each platform advises to use its logo and icon: Table of Contents Facebook logo & guidelines Instagram logo & guidelines X (Twitter) logo & guidelines LinkedIn logo & guidelines Pinterest logo & guidelines YouTube logo & guidelines Snapchat logo & guidelines TikTok logo & guidelines Threads logo & guidelines Bluesky logo & guidelines Facebook logo & guidelines Official logo - The Facebook 'f' logo is one of the most recognisable icons in the world. It was slightly redesigned in late 2019, taking a round shape, a brighter blue colour, and a centred icon. [Official logo - 512px, download png ] Colour options - You can only use the logo either in blue on a white or light-coloured background and the white version on a dark-coloured background. Interestingly, the official logo pack includes the black and grey versions of the Facebook logo. Facebook is also quite particular about how you can use their logo and fabricating materials or changing the colours of the logo is not allowed. >> Check out the full Facebook brand resources & guidelines . Instagram logo & guidelines Official logo - Instagram calls its logo the Glyph icon: [Official logo 120px, download png ] Colour options - You can change the glyph to a solid colour, although Instagram recommends keeping it black, white, or grey when placing it alongside other logos. [Official logo 120px, download png ] Meta-owned Instagram revealed a new visual identity in May 2022, comprising of a brand-new bespoke typeface and a brighter logo. Perhaps the most notable change is the new wordmark rendered in the 'Instagram Sans' typeface. Please note: Only use the App Icon with the rainbow-coloured background when you're referring to the mobile app. For example, when you're showing it on a device or you're encouraging people to download the Instagram app. Minimum clear space and size - The minimum clear space around the glyph icon is one half of the glyph’s size on all sides. And the minimum size permitted is 29x29 pixels. You also need to make sure that you follow the same spacing rules when adding text or your brand name alongside the Instagram logo. >> Check out the full Instagram brand guidelines. X (Twitter) logo & guidelines Official logo - The X (Twitter) logo is the infamous bird, merrily tweeting away: [Official logo - 120px, download png ] Colour options - Official guidelines say you should only use the logo in X (Twitter) black or white. If you're using any type of image manipulation service , you need to make sure that the logo is not altered or modified in any way, which includes animating the logo or surrounding it with additional elements. X's brand toolkit includes other categories as well. If you'd like to create a graphic that demonstrates that you have an X (Twitter) account, you should use their logo handle lockups, which are quite different from their logo partnership lockups that you would use to show your partnership with X. Logo handle lockup Logo partnership lockup Finally, and this could really come in handy, X has created post templates that you should use when you want to share a post. Their branding guidelines urge us to always use real posts and not alter or modify them in any way (not even with spell check). >> Check out the full X (Twitter) brand guidelines LinkedIn logo & guidelines Official logo - The LinkedIn logo is available as a full word or just the 'in' icon (also referred to as the 'in' bug) , both with the ® mark icon: LinkedIn Logo with ® symbol , download png 'in' Icon with ® symbol , download png Colour options - Previously, the LinkedIn logo was three colours: black, blue, and white. As part of the rebrand in 2019, the logo was simplified to just one colour, embracing simplicity and increasing readability. In addition to the updated logo, LinkedIn also presented their new brand system highlighting their passion for the community, which they express through illustrations and a warmer colour palette. While the default LinkedIn logo is blue, the black or white version can be used where the layouts are black and white only. It's also allowed to use the white logo on dark backgrounds so that it's easier to see. Minimum size - The minimum size of the logo and the 'in' icon is 21px on the screen. The correct height for the full LinkedIn logo is always measured by the height of the 'in' icon. As with other platforms, you need to make sure that the logo is spaced out correctly when you're changing its size or placing it next to other elements. What's unique about LinkedIn is their use of the ® mark which needs to be added to all logos, unless it's too small to see. >> Check out the full LinkedIn brand guidelines . Pinterest logo & guidelines Official logo - The Pinterest logo is the scripted letter 'P': [Official logo 120px, download png ] While Pinterest is quite happy for you to use their logo (or badge as they describe it) in tandem with the URL of your Pinterest profile, they're not happy for you to use their wordmark. In other words, don't use the long version which used to be popular: Colour options - When using the logo, always use the official Pinterest red colour. There are no alternative or reverse colour options. Language - You also need to be careful about any text you place alongside the Pinterest logo: Acceptable phrases: Popular on Pinterest, Find us on Pinterest, Follow us on Pinterest, Visit us, Find more ideas on Pinterest, Get inspired on Pinterest. Unacceptable phrases: Trending on Pinterest, Trending Pins. If you intend to create a call-to-action, you need to make sure that the text is in proportion to the Pinterest badge, your own logo is larger, and you include your Pinterest profile URL. >> Check out the full Pinterest brand guidelines . YouTube logo & guidelines Official logo - The YouTube logo comprises of the wordmark and the icon with the triangle, but you can use the icon on its own if you wish: Official YouTube logo (400 pixels) , download png YouTube logo (120 pixels) , download png Colour options - YouTube has several colour combinations that use the three brand colours: YouTube red, almost black, and white. To ensure the correct use of different colours, here are the key guidelines: Use the full-colour logos (with white or dark text) on solid backgrounds. Use the full-colour logo (with white or dark text) on busier, colourful backgrounds. Use the monochrome logo (white or black) if the background colour makes the icon hard to see. Minimum clear space and size - The logo or icon should never appear smaller than 24 dp in height. As with other networks, YouTube advises against altering its recognisable logo in any way: >> Check out the full YouTube brand guidelines . Snapchat logo & guidelines Official logo - The official Snapchat logo is the infamous Ghost mark: [Official logo 120px, download png ] Colour options - There are three acceptable ways and colours in which to use the Snapchat logo: [Yellow Background - App icon – | Monochrome – Black Background | Monochrome – White Background] Minimum clear space and size - The minimum size of the logo for digital applications is 45 pixels wide, and for print applications, it's 0.4\" (10mm) wide. The minimum clear space around the ghost mark is equivalent to one-third of the width of the ghost mark: Please note: Similar to Instagram, the icon with the yellow background can only be used when referring to the mobile app, not the platform itself. Snapcodes were introduced to make it easy for users to add others as friends and follow their Story. These can be customised as long as all Snapcode guidelines are followed, for example, not removing the frame, not tampering with the ghost-to-frame proportions, or inverting the colours. >> Check out the full Snapchat brand guidelines . TikTok logo & guidelines Official logo - The official TikTok logo is an edgy music note: [Official logo 600 px, download png ] According to their blog, the inspiration behind the TikTok logo was rooted in how the app had created a virtual stage for so many creators worldwide. Colour options - the logo has two variations: a white music note with an electronic wave effect in bright colours on a black background, or a black music note with the wave effect. And while TikTok has extensive guidelines on their advertising policies for ad creatives , there's not much said about the use of their logo. If you do happen to use it in your presentations or marketing, follow similar guidelines to other platforms - don't change colours and make sure to space it out properly. Editor's note: We're aware that the app is under a lot of pressure at the time of this update, including a potential ban in the US. However, its impact is hard to ignore, so we wanted to include it. After all, there are ways in which TikTok can be used for business , even if it's just using its video editing features! Threads logo & guidelines In Mosseri's words : The Threads logo, in Instagram Sans, is inspired by the @ sign, which stands for someone's username, the individual, and voice . It was designed by @rourkery, @jezburrows, and others. It's a single unbroken line, inspired by the loop seen in the app when a thread is started. Source: Instagram's brand resouces Instagram states that a minimum amount of clear space must surround the Threads icon. To determine the clear space needed, note the icon's width and divide by 4. They additionally created a lock-up version of the logo: icon + Threads. If you intend to use Threads assets in broadcast, radio, out-of-home advertising, or print larger than 8.5 x 11 inches (A4 size), you must seek permission. Submissions should be in English and include a mock-up of your intended use of the Threads logo. For further details, please visit the Instagram brand page. Get your Threads logo pack here. Bluesky logo & guidelines Bluesky logo represents a butterfly, a symbol of change and transformation. Source Bluesky, a direct response to X (Twitter), still hasn't published the official guidelines on how to properly use their logo assets, so we encourage you to reach out directly to their team for more information. Here's what we know so far: Their colour pallet consists of Azure Radiance (#01a6ff), Big Stone (#182d40), and Onahau (#cce6ff). Their icon is in the form of an azure butterfly. We've seen it as a standalone icon and in the icon + Bluesky version. Using text-based icons and glyphs Occasionally, the logo won't do as an image file, and you need it in a text-based format, e.g. to use on a website instead. These icons are sometimes referred to as glyphs and are usually available online. If you're looking to use these copy-and-paste icons in your marketing, remember that: you'll need to install the correct font on your computer and/or software if the user who's engaging with your content doesn't have the font installed (or it's incorrectly installed on the platform), all they will see are squares like this:  which is less than ideal. Here are some websites our team has found the most reliable with their icon library and toolkit: FontAwesome Flaticon's free Social Media Icons It's worth mentioning that while using third-party libraries for logos and icons can be useful, there's always a small risk that they may not be accurate or are too customised based on the library style. Whenever in doubt, refer back to the official brand guidelines set by social media networks, and you'll be fine. Over to you You should now be well-prepared to use social media icons and logos in your marketing, presentations, and, potentially, even your social media proposal for your clients. We hope you found this resource useful. Please feel free to let us know if we missed any important social media logos, icons, or brand guidelines that you'd like us to include in the future iteration of this resource.
