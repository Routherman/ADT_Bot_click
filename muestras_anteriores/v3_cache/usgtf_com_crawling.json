This method has become a very popular way of learning by colleges and learning institutions worldwide. One of the advantages of taking the online certification course is that it allows you the opportunity to review and understand the information at your own pace. Additionally, for many individuals online courses are convenient, offer flexibility and have cost-saving benefits. This online course qualifies you to effectively teach beginning to intermediate golfers. An associate member is one who successfully completes the online teaching curriculum, or one who successfully completes the teaching curriculum at an on-site certification course who did not successfully pass the playing ability test. Please note : It is not necessary to become an Associate member prior to becoming a Certified Golf Teaching Professional ® . The Associate certification course is provided as an option to make it more convenient to progress in the industry comfortably at your own pace. For more information or to register for the Associate online course, please click here . Certified Golf Teaching Professional – On-Site Course Many individuals prefer to attend the USGTF full certification course in person. These four-day, Monday through Thursday courses are held in various locations throughout the nation. The examining staff is there to share with you their lifetime knowledge of teaching and playing the game. They are also cognizant of not simply lecturing to you all week. Each day, individuals have the opportunity to practice teach with their fellow students. Furthermore, all participants have a chance to hit plenty of balls, as well as to become familiar with the golf course for the final day playing ability test. This on-site course qualifies you to effectively teach all levels of golfers. A Certified Golf Teaching Professional ® is one who attends an on-site certification course and successfully completes the teaching curriculum, verbal teaching test, and playing ability test, or one who successfully completes the online teaching curriculum as well as the verbal teaching test and playing ability test at an on-site certification course. For more information and a complete schedule of these on-site courses, please click here . Master Golf Teaching Professional – On-Site Course This on-site course reflects the highest standard of golf teaching certification. A Master Golf Teaching Professional ® is one who attends the three-day on-site course and successfully completes a verbal presentation on a written thesis, shotmaking demonstration, and written teaching test. To become a Master Golf Teaching Professional, one must be a Certified Golf Teaching Professional® in good standing for a minimum of 12 straight months. For more information and a schedule of the on-site Master certification courses, please click here . Certified Professional Golf Coach – Online Course There has always seemed to be some confusion in the difference between a Golf Teacher and a Golf Coach. As such, former-USGTF President Geoff Bryant asked our technical committee to clearly define the function of both roles. So here is their answer! A golf teacher helps recreational golfers, and a golf coach helps those who compete at the game. Are there similarities? Yes! Both are great ambassadors to the game of golf. Both need to play golf at a high level themselves. Mainly, the golf coach also must be well versed in subjects like fitness and nutrition, golf psychology, mental toughness and confidence. It’s the level and element of competition that separates them. For more information or to register for the Golf Coach online course, please click here . Certified Golf Club Manager – Online Course Golf Management can prove to be a very rewarding career. In the United States alone, there are 17,000 golf courses, and with golf becoming more of a global game, many certified golf club managers are finding employment outside of the United States as well. Additionally, current golf club managers are purchasing our material to refresh their knowledge on various subjects. This online course — created by golf club managers who specialize in all subjects — trains and certifies golf club managers by offering instructional videos on every aspect of the profession. This commonsense approach to learning is popular because so many of our participants already have a wealth of knowledge from other areas of life and business. These individuals do not require lengthy college courses or apprenticeship programs that generally last for years.

This common-sense approach to learning is popular because so many of our participants already have a wealth of knowledge from other areas of life and business. These individuals do not require lengthy college courses or apprenticeship programs that generally last for years. Golf Management can prove to be a very rewarding career. In the United States alone, there are 17,000 golf courses, and with golf becoming more of a global game, many certified golf club managers are finding employment outside of the United States as well. Additionally, current golf club managers are purchasing our material to refresh their knowledge on various subjects. Our Educational Staff The USGTF has taken advantage of the incredible talent within our organization, and in doing so, we provide education through online video lessons from currently employed specialists in golf club management. Our colleagues are open and thoughtful people who share their personal knowledge and years of experience in golf management. The Golf Management Industry Golf management is a huge industry. There are over 35 thousand golf courses worldwide that all require competent, service-oriented individuals to manage facilities. Furthermore, golf management is not restricted to golf courses alone. Popular national and international golf resorts require well-trained individuals who understand the importance of profit and loss. Just as important in their own right are golf teaching professionals. These people are the true ambassadors of the game, and their skills are essential to the growth of golf. They have the unique opportunity to mend a fragile ego or enhance a family vacation. In fact, many golf teaching professionals eventually enter into the field of golf management as a natural evolution through their performance, effort, and maturity. Professional golf management is also the key to the thousands of golf retail stores throughout the world. Marketing skills, knowledge of product and display techniques, properly discounting and timely sales, certain computer skills, as well as the age-old art of selling, are required. Further included in the industry are golf driving ranges, golf manufacturers and their representatives, the many golf trade shows, and the very lucrative golf travel industry. With regard to all of these segments of the 65 billion dollar golf industry, employers are more inclined to hire personable individuals with a professional golf management certification. The following topics are covered in the online course Pro Shop Merchandising All About Agronomy All About Employee Theft Tracking Golf Club Revenue Customer Relations Policies and Procedures Managing a Golf Course on a Strict Budget Introduction to Accounting The Professional – A Collection of stories and anecdotes from the golf service industry to provoke thought and action The Quest for Excellence This online course requires the successful completion of a 50-question, multiple-choice test Online Certification Course – $395.00 Certified Golf Club Manager® is a service mark of the United States Golf Teachers Federation and is our unique brand that represents the very best in golf club management.

February 21, 2019 admin-2 By: Kenneth Weaver When you consider the vast array of Social Media Platforms it can be a daunting task trying to decide exactly where your Social Media presence would be best suited. First you need to take a close look at your reasons for having a social media presence. Here are a few of the primary reasons why you need a social presence. Establish credibility with new clients/prospects Networking with consumers & Industry leaders Increase business leads/sales Boost SEO for your business website Competitive advantage SMM Drives targeted traffic to your website Helps you build relationships with your audience Which Social Platform/s should I use? That can vary depending on the focus of your business as well as the time and energy you have available to maintain your social presence. If your time and resources are limited you should have at the least have a Professional Facebook “Business Page ” regardless of your business focus. For Golf teaching and coaching professionals: Facebook : Your home base for social media marketing. This is also the best platform for paid/targeted marketing in your geographical region through Facebook ad campaigns. Note: 68% of Americans are on Facebook! Linkedin: Your personal professional page to help establish your credibility and network. Linkedin also offers professional business pages that can be very effective, especially if you already have a professional following. Instagram: Popular platform to share images/videos such as golf tips, feature students, feature teams…) all posts can be easily shared on your Facebook business page. Creating posts for Instagram (IG) is quite easy and time efficient with the added benefit that when you post on IG your post can also roll over to your FB page (one post covers two sites). Your IG posts can also be easily shared on Twitter! If you have the time/resources to take things a step further: Twitter: The top social platform to reach out and interact with others of similar interest. You choose who you follow and engage. The more active you are the higher level of engagement and exposure you will receive. You can easily share images/articles from your website to Twitter with “call to action” links back to your desired landing page/s. If you have products or merchandise that you are selling/promoting: Pinterest: This is by far the best social platform to promote products/merchandise for sale. The “pins” are easy to create can direct traffic back to your website or specifically your online marketplace. With Pinterest you set up “boards” covering various topics related to your business or niche. The boards attract followers and in turn the followers see and can click on your pins that display your products/merchandise. The only reason I placed Facebook ahead of Linkedin is that Facebook provides more options for business in regard to targeted marketing and is a more effective platform for building and directing a large audience (68% of Americans are on FB) to your website. That being said having a Linkedin profile and business page is easy to maintain once it is set up. Facebook requires more input to build your following and engagement but is more effective overall. Summary Regardless which Social platform/s you choose it is vital that you set up profiles that are “Professional” in appearance and a bio that is well written with a clear message stating what you have to offer perspective clients/customers. Another vital element is “engagement” with your following. Unless you are a major celebrity most people won’t engage with you unless you interact back with them. Show them that you care and are interested in what they are posting. Be responsive and reply to comments that followers leave on your timeline. Take a few minutes three or four times a week and cruise your “home feed” and like/comment on your followers content. This more often than not brings them back to your content! As the title implies these are “Social” platforms and social implies that there is two way communication. In Social Media marketing (SMM) it is important to remember that your followers (prospects) don’t want to be constantly pitched to – they want honest informative/entertaining engagement. You have to provide them something of value. This can be by the way of entertaining images/videos, education (golf tips) a bit of humor goes a long way! If you want people to follow you, it is vital to present them a unique path filled with value that’s interesting to them! Note: This is the second in a series of social Media marketing articles.

Whether you are employed by a local golf club or driving range, or you are an independent contractor whose main source of income is from instruction, having a social media presence is important. More and more people today are using social media platforms to search for all types of services they want to hire someone for, including golf instruction. What Exactly is Social Media? Social media can be defined as different types of electronic communication that allows people to create online communities to share ideas, information, personal content, videos, etc. Typically, most social media services are accessed via a desktop or laptop computer. However, with the invention of smartphones and tablets, more and more users are finding it easier to access these social media platforms “on the go” instead of sitting behind a desk in a more traditional setting. Also, with millions of people on various social media platforms at any point in time, it can be seen as very attractive for business owners who are trying to promote a product or service. How is Social Media Used Today? Social media today is used by individuals and businesses alike to share ideas, photos, videos, experiences, etc. There is almost nothing that can’t be shared via some type of social media site. Most social media sites today will allow you to set up a profile or a social media account for free. This is one reason why social media is so attractive for businesses today, because for the most part it doesn’t cost anything. Sure, there are promotions or paid advertisements that you can run and will be an expense to your business, but we will discuss this more in a little bit. Setting up a social media profile is also something which requires almost no technological experience or ability. Just about anyone can visit one of many social medial websites, click on “create a profile,” and the site will walk you through everything that you need to do in order to set up a profile on that site. If you are setting up a business profile, there are standard questions that will be asked, including your business contact info, location, what type of a business are you, etc. Fill in the info, upload a photo or two and you now have a social media profile on that site. As golf professionals, social media and technology are something that we should all be very involved with. I remember when I first started teaching golf professionally and visited local driving ranges on a busy evening. Instructors were known to “walk the line,” which meant walking up and down the driving range or the tee line and offering free tips or passing out business cards to anyone who may have seemed like they were struggling that day. This may have been something that worked years ago to gain students, and to be perfectly honest with you it maybe something that works today. It’s not a practice that I have done lately and I don’t know of many instructors who have. These days, when someone is looking for something or needs to know how to perform a certain task, they are told to “Google it.” When someone determines that they are in need of golf instruction, what are they most likely to do? If they aren’t a member at a local course where an instructor is based, or they don’t know an instructor personally, they are going to grab their smart phone or tablet and they are going to search for “golf instructors in my area” or “golf instructors near me.”This is where the first and most important social media platform comes into play. Do You Have Your Own Website? Having a website for your business is very important and it is something different from some of the social media examples I gave above. Usually, there is a cost involved in having a website, either in the website construction or the hosting of the site. You can spend the money and have someone design your website for you professionally, or you can attempt to design it yourself. The first thing that you will need to do is to purchase a website domain and hosting. I purchased my website domain, http://www.jimlabudagolf.com , and I have to pay annual hosting costs for this. Hosting a website is basically the space, or “land,” where your website will be. If you don’t pay the annual hosting cost, people will not be able to find your website online. Once you purchase your domain name and pay for your website to be hosted, it’s time to design your website. Designing a website seems like it can be intimidating, but it can become a fairly simple process. Many companies today offer domain names, website hosting and design services. There are many different templates you can choose from, depending on what you want your website to look like and the “theme” that you want your site to have. If you don’t have any experience writing HTML code to build a website from scratch, then I would recommend using one of the companies that offer domain names, hosting and website design. Personally, I use GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com) for my domain and hosting services. I then used one of their templates to design and customize my website with different pictures, various information and different tabs detailing different services that I offer. Once your website is designed and live on the internet, people can put your site address in their search bar and find you. But if no one knows that you have a website, how can they find out about you and the types of services that you offer? As golf professionals, there are many things we can include on a website. You can have a page that tells potential students more about yourself, lesson rates, where your lessons are usually given, any certifications you may have, etc. I use my website to try and tell potential students why they should come take a golf lesson from me and how I can help their game. You can post videos, testimonials from past students, pictures of you giving a lesson, etc. The opportunities are endless, but one of the main things a website should do is have a place where people can enter an email address and become part of your email list. This is great way for you to build your email and customer list. Why Do I Need to Use Email Marketing? Let’s face it. Everyone these days has an email address, and we are all getting bombarded with emails from companies that we have done business with in the past, and even some spam email from companies that we may have never done business with. Sure, you may open some of the emails that you receive and read them, but most of them you may not. So, why should we use email marketing as golf professionals? Because email marketing is a great way to stay in contact with not only your current students, but also with potential future students. It helps your students remember that you want to be the only golf instructor that they ever turn to for assistance and also keeps reminding your potential students that “I am here to help in case you need me.” A well-crafted email can be one of the most powerful marketing tools that a golf professional can have. Your email can contain a recap from the previous week’s PGA or LPGA Tour event, golf tips, product reviews, lesson and clinic information, or share some news about yourself and your business. During the golf season, I try to send out at least two emails a week to my email list. I try to change up what I provide everyone in my email, but I have sent out golf tips via video I posted on my website and YouTube, golf fitness videos, clinic and lesson information, and even professional swing analyses I have completed. So, how does sending emails to potential students help me? Let’s say you have a student that is struggling with distance. You give them lessons, see something in their swing that you can change, and by the end of the lesson you have them hitting the golf ball 15 yards farther. You can tell this story to everyone on your email list about how you helped a student pick up 15 additional yards in one lesson! All it takes is for one person on your email list that also wants more distance to say, hey, if it worked for that other person, maybe it will work for me. Now your email marketing has converted someone on your email list, a potential student, to a current student. They visited your website, entered their email address, and you have now converted that student into a sale and a paying customer. How do we get people to visit our website and sign up for our email list? This is where social media marketing comes in. Your website will be your main online presence, and the various social media platforms will be how you drive people to your website. What Social Media Platforms Can I Use? Today there are so many different social media platforms available that it would take me all day to go through them. Most individuals have at least one profile set up on social media, and some probably have multiple accounts. I’ll touch on some of the most popular platforms now and how they can be beneficial to a golf professional. Facebook Facebook is probably one of the most popular social media networking sites today. It’s an easy way to communicate with family and friends nearby and across the world. You can post pictures, articles, videos and numerous other things. Businesses can use Facebook to advertise to potential customers by posting anything that may relate to the goods or services that they are trying to promote. As a golf professional, I created a Facebook page called Jim LaBuda Golf to try and advertise my instruction services to potential customers. People will follow my Facebook page, and then they can “share” anything that I post to their friends. This is a great way to basically advertise for free. People can share the golf tips that I post on Facebook with the people that they are Facebook friends with, and hopefully will introduce new potential customers to the services that I have to offer. They visit my website to learn more about me and what I have to offer, and can even sign up to be on my email list. Then, when they are in need of a service that I can offer them in the future, hopefully they will remember me and contact me. Businesses that have Facebook profiles can also purchase paid advertisements. The business will determine where they want to target their customers (either locally or nationwide), who they want their potential customers to be, and how long of a period of time they want this ad to run. Then, based on the potential customer that the business defined, Facebook will run the ad for that business in the potential customer’s Facebook news feed. They will use the information that the business provided them, along with each individual’s Facebook profile, pages that they currently follow, and potential interests to determine who to show the ad to. Then, the person who sees this ad can determine whether or not they want to click on the ad to find out more information about what is being advertised. I have personally run Facebook ads to promote clinics that I was hosting and didn’t have anyone sign up for the clinics. However, I did have people who saw my ad on Facebook go to my website and sign up for my email list, so in that respect, running the ad was a success. Twitter Twitter is an online social media and networking site. People can write short messages called “tweets” and post pictures and short videos. People can use Twitter to follow companies or products that they are interested in and can then see when someone posts a tweet. Twitter is a good social networking site for someone who wants to scan through their feed quickly and not sit and read anything. You can scan through your tweets and only read the ones that you are interested in reading. One of the downfalls to Twitter, however, is that reading a tweet can be confusing. Since you have a limited number of characters in your tweet, you must get creative in how you are trying to get your point across. Sometimes the result of the limited characters tweet can be very clever; other times it can get very confusing. People who follow you on Twitter can see your tweets and then re-tweet what you post so that the people who follow them can see what they re-tweeted. They can also “like” your tweets which their followers can also see. I like to use Twitter to post links to the emails I send out to my email list. Most of the time I just tweet something like, “Checkout my latest newsletter,” along with a link to where someone can access this newsletter. Then, I hope that my followers will click on the link, check out what I have to say in my newsletter or email campaign, and then re-tweet it to their followers. Once they do that, there are an endless number of people who can see what you have to offer based on how many people tweet and re-tweet what you have to say. LinkedIn LinkedIn is basically a social media networking site for professionals. The LinkedIn courtesy is to not post anything personal on the site, but to have more professional or business-related posts. LinkedIn is considered to be the high-tech equivalent of attending your local Chamber of Commerce networking event. It’s a place to discuss business ideas, exchange business cards and talk a little bit about what you do. I don’t believe LinkedIn is a social media platform where you will find new golf students or promote your instruction services. However, if you are looking for a new professional opportunity, or if you are looking for new employment, then having a presence on LinkedIn will be beneficial. It’s always a good idea to connect with similar professionals in your industry. You never know when you may need to contact someone for a professional service, and you never know when someone may need to contact you. Instagram Instagram is another social media platform that offers free photo and video sharing. It is similar to other social media platforms where you follow other accounts of interest, and the posts that they create show up in your Instagram feed. Instagram is similar to Facebook but has a greater emphasis on mobile photo and video sharing. Therefore, Instagram is an extremely popular social media platform with the 18-29 year-old crowd. Instagram is a great way to post pictures and videos, but the videos shouldn’t be more than about 60 seconds long. So, if you post a video on Instagram, can you tell someone how to cure their slice in 60 seconds? You may be able to, but don’t forget the main purpose of using social media. You want to give someone an idea of how you can fix their slice on Instagram, but you really want to send them to your website and sign up for your email list to get the full story. I’ve personally started using Instagram more to post pictures and short videos, because it seems to be used more with a younger generation. Since we are golf professionals trying to grow and promote this game of golf, wouldn’t it make sense that we should have a social media presence with the younger generation? Instagram isn’t going away anytime soon, and in a very short period of time may become more popular than Facebook and Twitter. YouTube YouTube is an extremely popular service for sharing videos where users can like, comment, watch, share and upload their own videos. Videos can be uploaded using a desktop or laptop computer, or can be uploaded via a mobile device. YouTube videos today consist of a wide range of topics, anywhere from how to grow tomatoes to how to pour a concrete driveway. Anyone with a mobile phone or video camera can upload videos to YouTube. Because it is so easy to upload videos to YouTube, there are a good number of people on there who are looking to have the next “viral” video. A viral video is defined as one that becomes popular through internet or social media sharing. But how do you produce a video that can become viral? It’s impossible to answer, because no one knows. YouTube uses an algorithm where it can suggest video to a user based on the number of views it receives in the first 48 hours of being published on YouTube. For example, let’s say you’re looking for a video on YouTube that describes what the correct golf grip should be. Once you search for the correct golf grip in the YouTube search box, you will receive other suggested videos for the correct golf grip. As a YouTube creator, it is imperative that your video become one of these suggested videos by making sure that you receive as much view time as possible in these first 48 hours. How can you do this? The answer is simple: Post a link to your new YouTube video on as many social media sites as you possibly can. Send it out to your email marketing list, inviting people to watch your new video, post a link on Facebook, tweet a link on Twitter, and post a link on LinkedIn and Instagram. YouTube is the perfect place to post videos and be able to have people all over the world watch them, but you also need to understand YouTube’s algorithm for the videos that it recommends. You can make money on YouTube, but in order to monetize your channel, you need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. Those may seem like intimidating numbers, but you can achieve these totals with the proper focus and commitment. Conclusion In conclusion, I can’t tell you which social media platforms will work best for you. Some instructors are finding more success by posting shorter videos on Instagram, while other instructors are posting longer, more in-depth instructional videos on YouTube. You will need to experiment with different platforms and different types of posts to see which ones may work for you. The internet and social media are not something which are going away. There are more and more social media platforms being introduced and gaining traction every day. Sites like Snapchat are becoming popular with a whole new generation of golfers, and as instructors we need to be able to adapt to the social media platforms our students are on. Will our future students find our services via social media? Possibly, but we want to make sure that when someone in our area is looking for a golf instructor, our profile is front and center with them.

Certification  classes  in  the United  States  were  sold  out,  with  50  participants regularly   attending   each   of   the   then-quarterly sessions. New members were going out and finding or creating employment, a phenomenon that was not going unnoticed. One  of  those  who  took  notice  did  not  reside in  the  USA,  but  in  faraway  Timmendorfer-Strand, Germany.  His  name  was  Achim  Picht,  a  man  who owned  a  chain  of  golf  schools  named  AMP  Golf. Picht’s schools had locations in both Germany and Spain,  and  while  the  schools  were  successful,  his instructors  had  no  certification  or  formal  training of  any  sort.  Picht  realized  that  to  fend  off  the growing  competition,  he  needed  to  bring  some added credibility to his operation. So in January 1993, a team of examiners led by president  Geoff  Bryant  traveled  to  Malaga,  Spain, to  conduct  the  first  USGTF  certification  class  on foreign  soil.  On  the  team  were  Ben  Jackson,  Mark Harman,  Ken  Butler  and  Bob  Sprigle,  along  with staff  members  Arnold  James, Andy  Ritondale  and Bill  Evans,  the latter three serving as support for the international mission. The week exceeded everyone’s expectations, concluding with a fabulous dinner up in the mountains of the Costadel Sol. The  course  in  January  was  so  successful  that Picht  brought  back  the  USGTF  examining  team later that September to his home base in Germany, where  22  participants  enrolled.  That number was astounding, considering at the time the popularity of golf in Germany wasn’t anywhere close to what it is today, with far fewer golf courses. But demand for  golf  and  proper  instruction  was  increasing, and  Picht  saw  that  he  needed  to  be  a  part  of  it.Picht,   one   of   the   pioneers   of   German   golf instruction, passed away several years ago, leaving a  legacy  that  is  among  the  most  important  for the growth of the game in that country. Korean Golf Takes World Stage Many   people   attribute   the   proliferation   of Korean  players  on  the  LPGA  Tour  to  the  victory of  Se  Ri  Pak  at  the  1998  U.S.  Women’s Open, but the truth is the seed for success was planted much earlier.  Beginning  with  the  very  first  classes  held in  1989,  Koreans  were  a  large  presence  at  USGTF certification classes. It was not uncommon to see, out of 50 total participants, 10-20 from Korea. Some resided in the USA, but many returned home to teach the game to a new generation eager to learn. Pak’s victory only continued a trend that was started by these early pioneers with the help of the USGTF.  It’s  safe  to  say  that  even  had  Pak  not won, there would still be a large Korean presence in  the  women’s  game  today,  thanks  to  those  who saw  the  value  of  USGTF  certification  in  helping them grow the game in their native country. Prior   to   the   USGTF’s   existence,   teaching golf  in  Korea  was  largely  the  domain  of  the  club professionals  in  that  country  at  the  relatively  few courses  at  the  time.  The  game  was  exclusionary, as  only  those  who  had  ample  financial  resources could play or afford lessons. With the arrival of these new Korean USGTF members who set up teaching operations   wherever   they could,   a   completely different audience was reached. Junior golfers who showed  promise  were  allowed  access  to  courses, with  most  of  them  having  been  taught  by  USGTF members. It eventually became obvious that Korea needed its   own   golf   teaching   federation,   and   Sammy Oh took the reins.  He  oversaw  the  growth  of  his fledgling association, and needed the assistance of the  USGTF  examining  team  to  initially  handle  the instruction.  The  first  class  he  conducted  saw  over200  participants,  all  eager  to  learn  and  promote the game. Oh has since retired, and today Brandon Lee has capably taken over as president of USGTF-Korea. In  the  United  States,  Man  Kim,  then  from  San Jose,  California,  attended  a  USGTF  certification class  at  Adobe  Creek  Golf  Course  in  Petaluma, California, in the mid-1990s. Instead of returning to Korea,  he  stayed  in  the  USA  and  taught  his  young daughter the game with the principles he learned from  the  USGTF.  His  daughter  was  Christina,  and Christina  Kim  turned  out  to  be  one  of  the  most prominent  U.S.  Players during her career on the LPGA Tour, where she still plays today. She attended the  2015  World  Golf  Teachers  Cup  as  a  spectator, saying  hello  to  many  USGTF  and  WGTF  members and impressing everyone with her graciousness. A Worldwide Influence In 1997, the inaugural World Golf Teachers Cup was held in Naples, Florida, with participants from several different nations.  The  tournament was  the  first  that  brought  international  teaching professionals  together  from  multiple  nations  to represent their countries, and still today it’s unique among  competitions.  The second World Cup was held in Spain in 1998. Golf has always been healthy in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  continental  Europe continues  to  see  more  of  its  players  and  teachers play an international role. Canada saw its first certification class held in 1994 at Upper Canada Golf Course in Morrisburg, Ontario. Since that time, first Bob Bryant and now Marc Ray have served as presidents of the Canadian Golf  Teachers  Federation,  and  its  members  have made a lasting impact in teaching the game in that country. In Australia, Gary Cooney has ably led the Australian Golf Teachers Federation for a number of years, helping to promote the game in the Land Down Under. Golf in Brazil became a focus with the inclusion of  the  sport  in  the  Olympic  Games  in  2016,  but prior  to  that  in  2005,  Sao  Jose  Golf  Club  just outside  Sao  Paolo  hosted  the  7th  biennial  World Golf  Teachers  Cup.  Despite  the  game  being  still  a relatively minor sport in South America, 88 players teed  it  up  in  February  of  that  year  for  individual and team honors. China became the first Asian nation to host the World  Golf  Teachers  Cup  in  2013,  and  the  event was  a  rousing  success.  That country is currently facing some adversity in golf with the state-ordered closings of several golf courses, but USGTF-China is successfully meeting those challenges with Steve Mak at the helm. Golf   has   seen   tremendous   growth   inter-nationally  the  past  three  decades,  and  the  USGTF has  been  there,  serving  to  train  and  certify  the instructors  who  have  been  instrumental  in  this growth.  The future of the game certainly looks bright, no matter what language you may speak. Copyright  ©  2023 United States Golf Teachers Federation, All Rights Reserved 200 S.

This program has been instrumental in shaping my coaching philosophy, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who shares these passions. As a teacher at the Peddie School in New Jersey, I’ve had the privilege of working with remarkable young individuals, both in the classroom and on the golf course. In 2008, the same year I earned my full certification from the USGTF, I took over coaching the golf team, and we won our 100th match in April 2016 with a record of 100-10. Over my 15 years with the team, I have had the privilege of working with golfers that have gone on to play at top Division I programs such as Duke, Wake Forest, and many others. Notably, Max Greyserman, Peddie class of ’13, recently joined the PGA Tour and finished tied for 21st at the 2024 U.S. Open. Our team has enjoyed significant success, becoming 7-time MAPL Champions, 5-time Mercer County Champions with two record-setting performances, and 9-time NJSIAA Champions with two record-setting performances. However, one of the most fulfilling aspects of my career, thanks to the USGTF, has been working with young people new to golf. Peddie Golf Camp ( peddie.org/pgc ) introduces students to the game using the USGTF training method at the Peddie Golf Club in Hightstown, New Jersey. We have helped students learn the fundamentals of setup, grip, and stance, in order to place athletic young people from sports like soccer, lacrosse and baseball in the best possible position to meet success. One of our key focuses is to incorporate competitions, activities and on-course play to showcase how rewarding the game can be, inspiring students to continue practicing and improving, as well as having many playing in junior tournaments for the first time. Our hope is to plant a seed which then causes kids to ask parents to take them to the course and bring their clubs on family vacations. In addition, the real strength of the camp’s curriculum is that it provides another avenue and opportunity to foster character development in both our campers and the young people who serve on the staff. My goal is to foster a culture of dedication, respect, and continuous growth among my students and athletes, both on and off the golf course, and the USGTF training helped provide me this opportunity.

By opening the door to those who previously were never given the opportunity to teach golf, the USGTF started a trend that has led the game through three decades of growth and popularity never seen before.. Today, the USGTF is the largest national organization of certified golf teaching professionals in the world. The USGTF is a founding member of the World Golf Teachers Federation® and is one of 42 member nations that make up this entity. Both federations help to establish the world’s standard for golf teaching professionals. USGTF members can be found in all 50 states and around the world. They serve in many facets of the golf business, including teaching professionals, directors of golf, head professionals, and high-school and college coaches, among many other positions. USGTF members also have the opportunity to compete in our regional, national, and international events, along with the opportunity to network with their fellow members. To become a USGTF member, you may select the online Associate Member course or the four-day in-person Certified Golf Teaching Professional ® course.  This allows you to select the certification category that is right for you. It is not required to have any prior experience in the golf teaching industry before obtaining certification, except of course, the ability to play golf at a level of acceptability. For this reason, passing a playing ability test is required to become a Certified Golf Teaching Professional ® . History of the USGTF By James Gilmore, Denver, Colorado Metropolitan Tee Times The Challenge They said it couldn’t be done—-training and certifying golf teaching professionals. That was the exclusive terrain of the PGA of America, established in 1916. How could any other organization dare challenge tradition and compete head to head with such a Goliath of the golf industry? Furthermore, how did this entity become the largest organization of golf teaching professionals in the world? USGTF Former President For the answer to these questions, I asked Geoff Bryant, president of the United States Golf Teachers Federation, based in Port Saint Lucie, Florida. According to Mr. Bryant, “As a USGTF member it is important to understand the history and evolution of the organization and what prompted its founding. Our story is about taking the golf teaching profession and for the first time in history making it a separate entity unto itself. It is about providing opportunity, offering inclusion and demystifying the golf teaching profession. Having a history is what sets us apart and our story has proven ever relevant to over 35,000 golf teaching professionals around the world.” Mr. Bryant knew twenty years ago there was a market for personable, qualified golf teaching professionals. Bryant, a former ski racer and teacher, knew that some of the best ski instructors in the world attended six-day certification courses. If it worked so well for skiing, Bryant was sure it would work for golf. He was right. Certification Courses Nowadays, the USGTF holds 3 levels of certification with continuing education through Golf Teaching Pro magazine, the official member publication of the USGTF. In order to achieve certification, candidates may choose to attend the level of certification they prefer and successfully pass the criteria required for each level. The playing ability test also includes a division for seniors and super seniors. Golf Apprentices Prior to the existence of the USGTF, candidates with a desire to teach golf had to attend a three to four year apprenticeship program governed by the PGA. Ironically, these individuals did very little teaching. That’s still the case today. Most apprentices work for minimum wage and spend most of their time selling merchandise, cleaning clubs, or taking charge of tee times. USGTF Members Most USGTF members are entrepreneurs, well educated, and successful in other areas of life. What’s more, they all love to teach golf. Because of their experiences from various walks of life, USGTF members find employment or create their own. They occupy all aspects of the golf teaching industry from head professionals at private and public golf courses, to those working at driving ranges, golf schools, indoor facilities, high schools, colleges and private teaching enterprises. World Golf Teachers Federation But the story does not end there. There’s a global twist to all of this. In 1989, Bryant noticed an incredible number of foreigners traveling here to the United States to get certified. Their sentiments were always the same: they wanted to teach, not work as apprentices. Their own countries were not established to provide certification. Hence, the birth of the “World Golf Teachers Federation.” Established in 1991, the WGTF is now the world’s largest organization of golf teaching professionals. It boasts over 35,000 members and is comprised of 35 member nation federations. Because of help initially from USGTF examiners, all member nations are now conducting their own golf teaching certification courses. One Universal Umbrella According to Bryant, “It’s simply a matter of history repeating itself. In the 1960’s and early 70’s, all ski resorts in this country hired Austrian and Swiss instructors. Similarly, tennis resorts hired Australian teachers. With the advent and growth of those teaching federations in our own country, these sports now depend mostly on United States citizens. Additionally, teaching professionals prefer to belong to an organization that represents their own country. The great thing about the World Golf Teachers Federation is that it ties us all together under one universal umbrella, so that we can benefit from interacting and sharing ideas with one another.” WGTF Responsibilities “All member nation federations adhere to the WGTF charter of bylaws, that has established a standard of uniformity and quality of golf instruction throughout the world. These bylaws were established to protect the rights of teaching professionals, and to provide certain obligations and benefits to each member nation. Furthermore, the WGTF is responsible for administering the biennial World Golf Teachers Cup. This is a three-day event held alternately in the United States and abroad. It brings together golf teaching professionals from all over the world, plus provides the opportunity to compete, exchange ideas, and foster life-long friendships.” An Organization of Inclusion “While we are on the subject of the WGTF, I might add that our organization has always been diverse in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, and age. From the very beginning, the USGTF has been an organization of inclusion. This is one of our strengths that has had far reaching implications as we continue to grow worldwide.” USGTF Member “We are very proud for instance of USGTF members such as the late Julius Richardson, the first African American to be officially designated by Golf Magazine as one of the top 100 teaching professionals in the United States. By 81, Mr. Richardson continued to teach six hours per day year round, with a lesson agenda booked well in advance. He thanked the USGTF repeatedly for recognizing his lifelong accomplishments as a golf teaching professional and giving him the opportunity to belong to an organization of his peers. Unfortunately, this opportunity never presented itself to Julius in his younger years, simply because of the color of his skin. He has had an impact on the game that will be remembered indefinitely. Member Benefits I also asked Mr. Bryant about USGTF member benefits. It seems the administrative staff have all been hard at work over the years providing member benefits which are too many and varied to list in this article. However benefits include member liability insurance, group life insurance, ongoing refresher courses, a Level IV Masters certification course, educational and marketing material, and discounts on equipment with key golf manufacturing companies. Also of noteworthy interest: the annual United States Golf Teachers Cup, the biennial World Golf Teachers Cup and the World Golf Teachers Tour are extremely popular events among USGTF members. Quality of Golf Membership The one thing that was not difficult for me to perceive in this interview with Mr. Bryant was the passion he exhibited when talking about both the USGTF and WGTF, and the quality of their membership. Perhaps this, more than anything, characterizes the reason for the growth and success of both of these entities. Our Mission Statement The United States Golf Teachers Federation, through innovative, effective swing mechanics and teaching methodology, establishes a national and international standard in training and certification for professional golf teachers. In addition, the USGTF provides services for its members and promotes the organization and the golf teaching profession.

They had been on the driving range many times and I was aware that the little girl had a handicap. The grandfather was so dedicated and the little girl so determined, that I stopped to see if I could be of any help. Amber had no use of her right hand and arm, and even though she was swinging with her left hand and arm, she was still using a right-handed person’s stance. We tried a few things, and it soon became apparent that she had pretty good control using her left hand and arm, but using the left-handed person’s stance. Right then, I decided that I wanted to work with this little girl even more. After a couple of weeks, I got her a new set of golf clubs that I had specially made and tailored for her capabilities. I gave her lessons every Monday afternoon for several months and the results and progress were amazing. Her grandfather and I took her out on the course one day to play a few holes and we couldn’t believe what we were witnessing. While she could only hit the ball 15 to 20 yards or so, she was right in the fairway every time. She was sinking putts that even I had trouble with. What a transformation! I learned that Amber was involved in Special Olympics Gymnastics. Being a curious person by nature, I decided to inquire around and see if there were any Special Olympics for golf. After several phone calls to various areas, I finally was put in touch with a local chapter in Ventura County, California and called to see how I might get Amber qualified to play in some tournaments in the area or if they even had anything organized. I was told that there were a number of people with various handicaps who would like to learn to play golf but there just wasn’t anyone who could teach them. I told them what I had been doing with Amber and let them know that I would certainly be interested in working with them to start a golf program locally. Since they did not have a formal program organized, I spoke with my General Manager, who was very supportive of the idea and offered to give us the use of the driving range, golf carts when we went out to play a few holes, free golf balls, etc. We have a group of 12 athletes who range in age from 11 to 28. We have a tremendous amount of fun and all of this has been observed by others who have generously come forward and volunteered to assist with these fine young athletes. The volunteers are not only former and present students of mine, but golfers who have observed and heard of what we have been doing and wanted to get involved. I am especially proud of the teenagers who have been my students and are on the high school golf team – they have volunteered to give something back to the community and really look forward to coming out on Thursday evenings to help with our Special Olympics Team. My ultimate goal is to have my Special Olympic Golfers practice at UCLA one day, where a big Special Olympics Event takes place every June. I cannot begin to tell you what a rewarding experience this has been for me, when I look at the progress that each of the athletes has been able to achieve and I see that look of accomplishment and satisfaction on their faces, along with the joy their parents have voiced. It really makes me feel very fortunate to be a part of this. Maybe in a very small way, I really am making a difference. Many thanks to the USGTF. Without the excellent training I received, I would not have had the confidence to undertake this task. If you have any questions and would like to start a program like this in your area, please send me an email or fax so I can get in touch with you. It can be frustrating at times, but the rewards far outweigh the challenges. My fax number is 818-885-6044, or you can e-mail me at CandLinLA@aol.com .
