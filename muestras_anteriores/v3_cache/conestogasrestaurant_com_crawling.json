(WCJB) - “Let’s Go Brandon” is a political slogan that has become popular across the nation and used as a code for profanity. Conestogas Restaurant added a special to the menu called “Let’s Go Brandon.” The special includes fried corn nuggets and barbecue chicken empanadas. The slogan originated in October at a NASCAR race and has become widely used against President Joe Biden. It is now being chanted at presidential appearances and political rallies, and has been made into signs and apparel. One former customer says he does not agree with Conestogas using the slogan on their menu. “When you start making political statements like that on your menu board then I got to draw the line somewhere and that’s where I drew it. I decided not to go there any longer” says J.C. Thomas. Another diner says the name of the special actually drew him to the restaurant. “Just pure curiosity because there is a little bit of controversy with it. I think everybody just needs to lighten up a little and deal with it. It’s First Amendment. If you don’t like it, don’t come here” says Craig Terry. The co-owner of Conestogas, Melissa Robertson, says that sales of the special have been high since she created it. She emphasized they do have employees who support President Joe Biden and are fine with the special. Saying, as Americans, they have the right to free speech. Copyright 2021 WCJB.

Conestoga Restaurant's Uncle Crabby Bleu burger is a half-pound of satisfaction -- with lump crabmeat, bleu cheese, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and ancho chipotle mayo on top. STAFF Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link There are evenings — especially summer evenings, and especially Friday evenings in the summer — when the leftovers from Monday and Tuesday dinners are picked over and the thought of a quick takeout pizza just doesn’t appeal. One of our go-to spots in times like these has become the Conestoga Restaurant just on the city’s eastern edge. Initially, we chose it because it’s relatively close to home (we’ve all done that, with varying degrees of satisfaction). But we keep going back because the food, especially in the past couple of years, hasn’t disappointed us yet. Service can be leisurely, especially during a busy night on the outdoor patio. But if you’re sitting amidst the landscaping that’s nicely matured, screening East King Street traffic but still providing views of the old Bridgeport bridge, and you’re watching birds flit along the Conestoga River, there are worse ways to relax and nurse a drink while waiting for your meal. A recent Saturday visit was a bonus: one of the restaurant’s monthly Greek Weeks, with Greek specialties such as pastichio on the menu. That’s what I always choose: The mix of pasta, ground beef and bechamel sauce is something I don’t make for myself at home, so it’s a special treat when I find it out and about. On this visit, the serving of pastichio ($16) was a bit smaller than I’ve had in the past (it’s always been enough for two meals, but I polished this off with no problem). Still, it was flavorful and delicious, and I didn’t have to stand in the kitchen on a 90-degree day to make it. My dining partner opted, as usual, for a Conestoga Restaurant burger. There are 10 standbys on the menu, and I think we’ve tried them all at one time or another. Prices range from $12 (The All-American Burger) to $18 (The Double-Bacon Cheeseburger) for the half-pound sandwich served with lettuce, tomato, homemade pickles and homemade Conestoga chips . This visit? The Uncle Crabby Bleu ($15), grilled to perfection (medium) with lump crab, Danish bleu cheese, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and ancho-chipotle mayo, piled on a toasted roll. If that sounds like a lot, it is. I need two bites to get through the full height, especially with all the extra goodies piled on top. Here’s how you know it’s filling: My dining companion urged me to have some of the accompanying potato chips because the burger and chips were just too much together — and that never happens. To pass the time while we waited for food, my companion had a Goose Island IPA ($6.50), while I had an herbal lemonade ($9): fresh-squeezed lemons, Patron Citronge and infused herbs. That’s not always on the cocktail menu but if it is, grab one. They’re not to be missed. Service took a bit of waiting — the patio was absolutely packed — but it nevertheless was efficient, cheerful, accurate and welcoming. It’s not a fancy atmosphere, and it’s not elaborate food, but it’s our sweet spot, with good food and drink. At the end of a long, long week, there are few treats any nicer. Newsletter Success!
