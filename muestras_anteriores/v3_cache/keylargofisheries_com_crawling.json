YoYoDeux New York City, New York 6 2 Reviewed 1 December 2023 via mobile HORRIFIC!! DO NOT GO THERE! I’ve been going to the keys since the 70s, and going to KLF since the 80s. Back then it was fresh, fabulous and the place to get stone crabs on the way to Islamorada. It was the place the locals went to. The last time I was there, 12/22, I had lunch with a friend and then bought some claws to have for dinner. The lunch was a mediocre lobster roll with old cold fries for $30, and it was less than half the size shown on their website. BUT, when I went to eat the claws 5 hours later - and I crack them myself to keep them as fresh as possible - the $50/lb delicacies were disgusting. Possibly not cooked properly, and definitely old and turned. The meat was mushy and grey, not white and firm as a fresh claw would be. And the staff in the store were so sullen that I didn’t even want to face returning them. There are plenty of other pop-up sellers on A1A now, and there was even one a block away from KLF. The change in ownership to a conglomerate 6/21 is clearly not “keeping it the same” and they must not ever check the food quality. NEVER AGAIN!

While my Lobster Tacos were good and the calamari was tasty, everything was cold from the pick up window. This is confusing as they page you when ready which means the kitchen isn’t coordinating plates- a shame when your total bill is over $60 before a tip. Ice in the drinks smelled and tasted like fresh fish. Ambiance left a ton to be desired unless you enjoy your lunch with running circular saws and workers yelling back and forth to each other in a foreign language. Like I said actual plates were decent in terms of taste, but cold food is the worst.

MICHAEL A A 1 1 Reviewed 25 November 2023 via mobile Not even close. The absolute worst calamari I've ever had. Overcooked, rubbery , frozen rings with a \"Burger King\" coating. Chicken sandwich, dry & chewy.....feeding the sharks was the best part.

When we walked onto the back patio to secure a table, we overheard a fellow diner exclaim not so subtly “why are there so many Asians here?” My first thoughts were 1. Yay, he said Asian rather than some slur, and 2. because Asians know good seafood. There you have it. Key Largo Fisheries attracts people who know good seafood. It’s fresh, delicious, definitely not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and in this case, really the best seafood you can find.

TravelingB0B Fort Pierce, Florida 603 314 Reviewed 1 November 2023 First Stop in the Keys - Amazing Lobster Roll! The Backyard was a little tricky to find our first time there, but it was worth the search. You place your order at the window and they give you a little beeper when your order is ready at the pick-up window. My wife ordered the Lobster Roll and it was the best she ever had. It's the way lobster rolls should be! I had the lobster taco and it came with 3 amazing tacos that I could barely finish. Delicious! We'll stop here again next trip.
