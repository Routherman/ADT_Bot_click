It’s what we are all about. Like many Irish sayings, “ happy out” sounds like it originated after one too many pints. It’s meant to describe a feeling of happiness or contentment that is hard to put into words. That “all is right with the world” feeling. Here at O’Riley and Conway’s that’s what we’ve been after since the beginning. First opened days after prohibition, then as Quaerna’s, O’Riley and Conway’s maintains the oldest active liquor license in Rock County held by the same family. While it could be good ol’ Irish luck, we think our little slice of Dublin is here for a reason. That reason? All of the friends we’ve made along the way.
