I’m completely uninterested in social work that is not simultaneously aesthetic, and simultaneously an interesting conceptual artwork.’ Kirsha is the First Lady of Mona—the boss’s missus, Mona’s better half, or Mrs. Mona if you prefer. The stiletto-toting Yank, and Tassie local since 2010, enhances our core activity with a series of projects that marry an almost vigilante approach to beauty with outrageous glamour, and specific social outcomes. Kirsha is a colourful counterpart to her august mate, who is less interested in beauty than in taking it apart and understanding how it works. She’s drawn to problems rather than avoiding them—and places transformation at the heart of her work, a lifelong quest to turn flaws into features, shit into gold. Kirsha was interviewed by Elizabeth Pearce, Mona Research Curator and Senior Writer, in July 2016. EP : Why are you opening a hacking school? KK : It seemed like a good evolution of my CA$H 4 GUN$ project. At first I thought it would be fun to do as a conceptual artwork, but I wasn’t serious—it seemed a bit too Black Panthers. Although, now that I say that, I realise that Robert Trivers, the evolutionary biologist who is one of our hacking school’s spiritual guides, actually was a Black Panther. He got excommunicated ‘for his own good’. Anyway, a hacking school sounds dangerous and exciting, and is therefore attractive to at-risk youth. I mean, these guys are literally killing each other and selling crack, so it’s not like they are going to sign up for your feel good, let’s-all-love-one-another self-improvement program. Basically I want to overthrow traditional ideas of what social work looks like—ugly. And what social programs feel like—dorky and boring. It’s tech education disguised as a hacking program—housed in a secret, Dr-Strangelove-meets-James-Bond villain lair. EP : I am always trying to work out where the line is in your projects between art and social justice. KK : I can't do it if it's ugly. I'm completely uninterested in social work that is not simultaneously aesthetic, and simultaneously an interesting conceptual artwork. This is important because it impacts what I am able to give… I mean, it’s not really my giving, it’s David’s giving. But the level to which I am prepared to manipulate him into doing what I want is directly tied to how aesthetically rewarding the project is. So if we're going to have a garden program—yeah, okay, I'll get behind a garden program. But I probably won't really start to drive it and expand it to new communities and put all that effort in unless I feel like it's an inspiring, radical reinvention of what a garden program looks like. The basest part of me wants to be at a five-star hotel lapping up luxury treatments at the spa. I can redirect that drive to social work if it becomes art, and if it becomes an engine for societal reinvention...

Which is why, perhaps, she founded Material Institute—a non-profit social project and registered charity, reaching from Tassie to the USA, New Orleans to here in Hobart.

The Makeup of the Universe Students learn about the stars—Miss Universe and the universe—while earning a degree in beauty. Guest lecturers include Nobel Prize–winner Brian P. Schmidt who discovered that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. He’s the recipient of our inaugural makeover. Jung-le Gym Where conceptual art meets exercise: students act out inner darkness and human archetypes in muscle building aerobic-style, inspired by Carl Jung. Classes take place in open, outdoor spaces, as well as a gymnasium filled with equipment designed by artists and engineers. The Embassy Students lay tracks, produce records, write lyrics, and participate in delivery and recording workshops led by esteemed producers. Bio Lab Where art meets biological building and research. Students learn the ethics of bioengineering (controversial terrain), create non-toxic nail polishes, designer genes (and jeans), and everything in between—including ways in which we could turn the entire building into a living organism. We’re of the opinion that technology is becoming biology: ‘it’ becomes ‘them’, and then it becomes ‘us’. So, what will it be? Or should that be ‘us’?

Press MoMa (Mona Market) An al fresco extravaganza of music and food, art and performance, science and craft (of the non-naff variety). A glamorous, roaming collision of high and low art, held on Sundays in the summertime. MoMa—only slightly shitter than Salamanca market. Much, much shitter than the MoMA in New York.

Forest Economics Congress: New A$$. class 17 August 2023 A few years ago, I was invited to do the keynote for the Tasmanian Economic Forum. You’ve got the wrong person, I told them. Of all subjects on earth, economics is the one I know least about. And definitely care least about. One need only begin to say the word, econo … zzzzzzz … and I’m snoozing off. But they insisted: they wanted someone from outside their world, someone fresh, to shake things up. Fine. But I should at least offer something relevant to their forum. So I did some calculations and presented this graph: Talkk Male visitor sues Mona over women-only Ladies Lounge Gabriella Coslovich • Sydney Morning Herald Hobart’s popular Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) could be forced to shut down its women-only Ladies Lounge created by Kirsha Kaechele, wife of museum founder David Walsh, if an anti-discrimination case launched by a male visitor is successful...
