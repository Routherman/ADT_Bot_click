Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Home Let's Eat Let's Eat 7 Things You May Not Know About Fudpucker’s Beachside Bar & Grill By Staff August 24, 2024 0 1300 Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Where Fudpucker’s Started Fudpucker’s wasn’t always a Beachside Bar & Grill. It opened in 1982 as a snack bar inside NightTown – Destin’s first Nightclub where it was called Fudpucker’s Barside Galley. Thanks largely to great food and a successful T-Shirt, the following year Fud’s moved to a beachside shack in South Walton County where Pompano Joe’s is today. It is there that it became Fudpucker’s Beachside Bar & Grill. After a fire destroyed the building in 1985, Fud’s moved to Okaloosa Island next to Cash’s Faux Pas. In 1989, Fudpucker’s opened a second location on the new U.S. 98 in Destin. While Destin is now home to the only standalone Fudpucker’s, you can still enjoy our signature dishes at Pelican’s Roost at the Sundestin Beach Resort and at the Tiki Hut in Waterscape on Okaloosa Island. Beer Can Collection One of our founders, Tim Edwards, didn’t just contribute to the economy; he practically fueled it — one beer at a time. His college beer can collection has grown into a wall-spanning spectacle in several of Fudpucker’s dining rooms. This unique display is a tribute to Tim’s youthful zeal and love of beer. Every year, we host the Winter Brewery Collectible Show—a perfect blend of beer memorabilia and, well, more beer. Maze-Like Building Entering Fudpucker’s Beach-side Bar & Grill is like stepping into a whimsical labyrinth. No, seriously, good luck finding your way out! Our “7 Level Tree House” dining areas each boast unique themes (decorated with classic Fudpucker junk) and quirky names, creating a fun maze-like structure. You’ll encounter countless staircases, a vestibule with five different paths, an elevator, and even a few doors to nowhere. Don’t be surprised if families make a few laps before stumbling upon the exit. NWFL’s Only Alligator Park With over 200 alligators, free alligator shows and free admission, Gator Beach is undeniably “The World’s Greatest Alligator Park.” Explore our Reptile Discovery Zone, meet baby gators, join interactive guided tours, feed the gators, and get a photo holding one. Gator Beach is Destin’s ultimate adventure spot. For more info, slither over to www.GatorBeach.com . Honor Roll Program For over 35 years, Fudpucker’s has celebrated academic excellence with our Honor Roll program. We provide award certificates to elementary and middle school students who make the A or A/B Honor Roll, each redeemable for a free meal. Every year, we expand this program to more classrooms in Okaloosa and Walton Counties, supporting our local scholars one free meal at a time. Rob Whaack Scholarship In 2018, we partnered with Northwest Florida State College to create the Rob Whaack Culinary Scholarship, honoring our beloved kitchen manager. This scholarship covers 100% of the costs for the 12 credit hours needed for the Chef’s Apprentice Certificate, ensuring Rob’s legacy lives on. Fun While You Wait Anyone who’s dined out in Destin during summer knows that long waits are inevitable. But at Fudpucker’s, we turn waiting into a blast. With four bars to kick off your dining experience, NWFL’s only Alligator Park (with free admission), a photo scavenger hunt with prizes, a Fudnominal gift shop, a henna tattoo parlor, a hurricane simulator, bar games (like Ring & Hook and Cornhole), giant Jenga and Connect Four, and live entertainment, we’ve earned our title as “The Best Place To Wait”!

Things haven’t changed much here since my last update, but I wanted to share something with you so you get a feel for the impact this virus has had on local businesses in Destin – mine in particular. Back in 1982 when I opened Fudpucker’s as a Snack Bar in an 8’ by 10’ space at a local nightclub (Nightown) my sales the first night were $223.  Yesterday (38 years later) my sales in a 36,000 square foot building were $182.  In other words, the downturn in business has been catastrophic for us and our employees – just as it is for most small businesses across the country.  We have laid-off 96% of our employees and have fewer staff now than since 1985. Like many small businesses we are doing everything we possibly can to secure loans from the government and our bank to keep operating in an effort to keep our core staff employed. The FUDPUCKER TRADING COMPANY IS OPEN ONLINE AT www.fudpuckerstore.com if you are in the need of one of our World Famous T-Shirts. The bottom line is that we will make it through this – that is a promise.  We all will and may even come out of this mess with a more positive outlook.  I believe we are due for a re-set as to what is important and what is not.  I am encouraged when I see families working together in their yards and walking together in their neighborhoods.  My friends tell me that playing board games are a big deal and that their kids are actually enjoying their time with mom and dad. I miss seeing a full restaurant with people laughing and enjoying the food, alligator shows and family entertainment that we are famous for.  Most of all I miss you – the thousands of loyal customers that made it possible for me to make a good living and send my kids to college. Maybe what I am trying to do here is to say thanks for your support over the years and to let you know that you will be welcomed back with open arms next time you come by. Be safe and be good to your family and friends.  They are what matter most. Chester Kroeger aka Father Fud Founder and CEO of Fudpucker’s Beachside Bar & Grill"
