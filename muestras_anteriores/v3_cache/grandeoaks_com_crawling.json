Upon agreeing that Jones could own and operate the facility, Coral Ridge Country Club was developed. For the next several decades Jones and his wife ran the club with the help of their two sons, Robert Trent Jr. and Rees Jones. In 2000, the legendary architect passed away, leaving the ownership of Coral Ridge to his children. In 2004, a partnership group reached out to the Jones brothers about potentially buying Coral Ridge from the family. This group included now Managing Partner and General Manager, JJ Sehlke, PGA. For Sehlke, this was not his first time involved in the purchase of a club/development. The son of a PGA Life Member, Jerome Sehlke, Sehlke was entrenched in golf from an early age, first working in the shoe room in the early 80’s at Grande Oaks Golf Club, formerly known as Rolling Hills Country Club. Sehlke went onto study finance and play golf at the University of Miami, before finishing his degree at Nova Southeastern University. During this time, Sehlke took classes at night while working in the bag room and as an assistant professional at Grand Oaks under Tom Pomante, PGA. While working in golf as a way to pay for school, Sehlke had zero interest in making a career in golf. “I was interning with different financial groups, I was going to do anything but golf,” he said. Upon graduating, Sehlke was offered a deal by the ownership group of Grande Oaks that he simply couldn’t deny, ultimately establishing his career in golf. “In 1992, I would have been 24 and the owners of Grande Oaks said, will you be our Director of Golf and we will pay you 1,000 bucks a week?” Sehlke, remembered thinking to himself, said, “I'm rich, this is amazing!” Sehlke remained in that role until 1996 when he decided to go back to school to earn his masters in finance. Having maintained a strong relationship with the ownership group of Grande Oaks, Sehlke was offered the General Manager position, overseeing the entire golf and hotel operations. After two years, Sehlke, as he describes it, was “sold” to Boca Resorts, Inc., another ownership group that focuses on high end luxury communities. With several projects lined up in the Hilton Head Island area, the company wanted to bring Selkhe on as a minority partner to oversee golf and staffing. Selkhe would stay involved with the group until 2004 when a longtime family friend and Coral Ridge Country Club member, Phil Smith, owner of Phil Smith Automotive Group, called with an offer. He said, “if I buy a country club, will you come down and be my partner, manage it and oversee it for me?” Reluctant to say yes due to the fact Selkhe and his wife just had their third child and were happy with their life in Hilton Head, Smith made an offer Sehlke could not deny. In 2004, Sehlke, Smith, former Florida Senator, Jim Scott and other local businessmen purchased Coral Ridge Country Club from Rees and Robert Trent Jones Jr. At the time, Coral Ridge featured one 18-hole championship course designed by Robert Trent Jones and the American Golfers Club - a public, daily fee, executive course with a driving range. In 2005, hurricane Katrina made a significant impact on the property, ultimately closing down the American Golfers Club. As a result, Sehlke was dealt a 10-year rezoning project which resulted in building 45 homesites, a city park and brand new par-3 course, named the Rees Jones Nine. All in an effort to improve the community environment of Coral Ridge Country Club and the surrounding communities. Fast forward to 2020, Coral Ridge was looking to redesign the golf course and reached out to Rees Jones to do a complete ground-up restoration on his dad’s original project, ultimately reopening the course in December 2020. While consistently moving locations and jobs early in his career, Sehlke could not be more proud of the obstacles he has overcome and legacy he is now a part of at Coral Ridge Country Club. During the early stages of his career, Sehlke considered regaining his amateur status and forgoing his PGA Membership but recalled a very important conversation with John Reed, a mentor of Sehlke, that changed the outlook on his career. He said, \"you have two options right now, do you want to work at a club or do you want to belong to a club?\" “Because you have to decide what you want to do.” Now, Sehlke is pleased to say he works at a club, belongs to a club and owns a club. < Older Post Newer Post > Share this story Jim McLean, PGA & Dennis Walters Announced as 2025 PGA of America Hall of Fame Inductees September 8, 2025 The PGA of America announced today that Jim McLean, PGA of Jim McLean Golf Schools, and Dennis Walters, Honorary PGA of America Member, will be inducted into the 2025 PGA of America Hall of Fame Class.

Nationally, he was named PGA of America Teacher of the Year (1994) and received the PGA Professional Development Award (2020).                                                                                                                        As a player, McLean qualified for the U.S. Junior, U.S. Amateur, U.S. Open, and U.S. Senior Open, and made the cut in the Masters. Earlier in his career, he was Director of Golf at Sunningdale, Quaker Ridge, Sleepy Hollow, Tamarisk, and Doral. Both of his sons, Matt (Wake Forest) and Jon (Oklahoma State), played college golf.                                                                                                                         Born in Neptune Township, New Jersey, World Golf Hall of Fame Member Dennis Walters fell in love with the game early and became one of the state’s top junior golfers.                                                                                                                                     He finished 11th in the 1971 U.S. Amateur and after playing collegiate golf at North Texas State University, aimed for the PGA TOUR, reaching the finals of Q-School.                                                                                                                                     His plans changed dramatically after a golf cart accident in 1974 left the 24-year-old paralyzed from the waist down. Showcasing the dedication and devotion that has marked his life ever since, Walters turned tragedy into inspiration and found a way to continue playing the game he loves at a high level while inspiring others to do the same.                                                                                                                                     In 1975, he began playing from a custom-made swivel seat on his golf cart, beginning a career of inspiring all golfers, especially those with disabilities, and leading to the recognition of a new category: Adaptive golf. Walters won the inaugural USGA Adaptive Open in the seated division in 2022. Two years later, he won the Florida Adaptive Open in the seated division shooting 74, one shot lower than his age.                                                                                                                                     Since 1977, he has staged the world-famous one-hour trick-shot clinic, the “Dennis Walters Golf Show,” more than 3,000 times, traveling over 3.5 million miles and always accompanied by his co-star rescue dog.                                                                                                                        Walters was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2019; New Jersey Golf Hall of Fame ( 2019); received the USGA Bob Jones Award (2018); Neptune High School Hall of Fame (2016); South Florida PGA Section Hall of Fame (2010); PGA of America Distinguished Service Award (2008); University of North Texas Hall of Fame (2000); joined the likes of U.S. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Gerald Ford as a PGA of America Honorary Member (1992); and received the Ben Hogan Award (1978).                                                                                                                         The PGA of America Hall of Fame originated in 1940 at the suggestion of famed sportswriter Grantland Rice. It is the highest honor the PGA of America can bestow upon its membership or ambassadors of the game.

Brant Peaper Wins South Florida Assistant PGA Professional Championship August 29, 2025 Naples, FL                                   - Brant Peaper carded rounds of 67-69–136 to win the South Florida Assistant PGA Professional Championship by one shot held at Bear’s Paw Country Club, August 28-29.                                                                                                            With a staggered leaderboard following round one, Peaper, an Associate Assistant Professional at Lost Tree Club, trailed Ryan Crowley by three, who matched the Bear’s Paw course record with an 8-under 64 during the opening round.                                                                                                            For the second consecutive year, Peaper entered the final round in the lead group. While being 2-under on the day through 6, Peaper’s tee shot found a bunker on the par-5, 7th hole.                                                                                                            “I hit what I thought was a really good drive, which leaked into the bunker. Then I took off a little more than I could chew and hit it right into the lip,” explained Peaper on what led to a double-bogey on the 7th hole.                                                      Undeterred, Peaper parred the 8th and 9th holes to finish even on the front-9 and 5-under overall, still within two shots of the lead.                                                      “There is still a lot of golf to be played,\" Peaper told himself. “It doesn’t really matter, you just have to try to hit really good shots and see what happens.”                                                                                                            Heading into the back nine, Peaper did not drop a single shot, playing the final 9 holes at 3-under, including a birdie on the 17th that ultimately secured the one-shot victory over Taylor Morgan, PGA of Pine Tree Club, and Michael Kartrude, PGA of The Bear’s Club. South Florida PGA Foundation Dedicates 12th Habitat for Humanity Home in Labelle August 29, 2025 Labelle, FL (August 29, 2025)                                               - The South Florida PGA Foundation dedicated its 12th Habitat for Humanity home to new homeowners Jesus and Paola. This build was made possible through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Lee and Hendry Counties.                                                                              In 2023, the thought of home ownership was merely a glimmer of hope for Jesus and Paola. With a desire to provide a safe home for their young family, faced with many challenges along the way, today's dedication was filled with joyful tears and much excitement as they received the keys to their first home, thanks to the support of the South Florida PGA Foundation and all of the members who supported the project.                                                                  Bearing gifts upon their arrival, Jesus and Paola were so grateful and appreciative of all the support they received on the journey to homeownership, from their family and friends to the volunteers, Habitat for Humanity staff, and beyond.                                                                  “We have a home for our kids to grow,” said Paola. “We are very happy and excited to receive this home.” Unlocking Opportunities: PGA Members excelling as General Managers - Brian Bartolec, Ken Kosak & Rob Oosterhuis By Matt De Tullio • August 26, 2025 PGA of America Golf Professionals are coined as experts in the game and business of golf, whose mission is to grow the game we all love.                                                                                                            At more than 30,000 strong, the PGA of America offers an extensive network of professionals to lean on, ask questions, seek advice, and collaborate with. Opportunities to network can come at the Chapter, Section, and National levels, all designed to elevate the PGA Professional.                                                                                                            As golf department heads, PGA Professionals play an integral role in facilities, and PGA Professionals in high management roles are becoming increasingly more prevalent.                                                                                                            Outside of being PGA General Managers, one thing stands out for Brian Bartolec of Shadow Wood Country Club, Ken Kosak of Broken Sound Club, and Rob Oosterhuis of Royal Palm Yacht & Country Club – they are all involved with the Club Management Association of America (CMAA) and all three sit on the CMAA Florida Chapter Board of Directors.

This year’s event welcomed 42 two-person teams of senior PGA Professionals playing in a four-ball format.                                                                  Brown, a PGA Teaching Professional at the Yacht and Country Club, and Mielke, a PGA Teaching Professional at High Ridge Country Club, first teamed up in the 2023 Senior Pro-Pro when Brown joined the Section. Since then, the pair have not lost a Senior Pro-Pro Championship at North Palm Beach Country Club, including a 12-under 59 last year for a total of 32-under in the last three years.                                                                  Starting on hole number 12, the duo started slower than years past, playing the first seven holes at 2-under. Once they turned to the front-nine, Brown and Mielke played the next 11 holes at 7-under to secure the win by one over Daniel Heaslip, PGA, and David Witt, PGA, at 9-under.

Alan Morin, PGA, claims the Senior Division title with a 7-under performance.                                                                  The South Florida PGA Bushnell Stroke Play Championship is the third of four SFPGA Majors to be played throughout the 2025 season. In addition to the major, the 36-hole event also served as a qualifier for the 2026 Corales Puntacana Championship on the PGA TOUR, in which Evan Bowser earned the spot as the low Class-A Professional.                                                                  After a 6-under 66 in the opening round at BallenIsles North Course, which included only 25 putts, Patterson, an Associate Assistant Professional at the Golf Club of the Everglades, trailed by one. With his final round at Old Palm, Patterson opened with a bogey before finishing his first nine holes at 2-over.                                                                  With Evan Bowser, PGA of LaPlaya Golf Club, holding a two-shot lead on the back nine, Patterson checked the leaderboard and knew he needed to make a charge.                                                                  “I looked at it (leaderboard) on 15 and that's when I knew I needed to make some birdies,\" Patterson said. “I looked at it on 17, and Evan was 8-under, so I was two back.”                                                                  Patterson proceeded to make an eagle on the par-5 17th and a birdie on the par-4 18th to claim the outright title by one in only his third SFPGA Major since joining the Section in 2024.                                                                  “I'm still taking it in and processing,\" Patterson said following the win. “I'm going to play in every tournament now.”                                                                  While finishing runner-up to Patterson by one, Bowser, a PGA Assistant Professional at LaPlaya Golf Club, secured low Class-A Professional honors, earning him entry into the Corales Puntacana Championship on the PGA TOUR.                                                                  “It is super exciting,” exclaimed Bowser, who was unsure he would even be able to play in the event. “I was flying back from a trip in Michigan, and my flight got cancelled, so I didn’t get here until 2:30 AM Monday.”                                                                  Bowser is no stranger to competing at the highest level, as he competed in the 2024 PGA Championship with his sister on the bag and family cheering him on, and looks to have the same support at the 2026 Corales.                                                                  “I am sure she will be there for me, and it should be a family affair for sure, it will be a lot of fun,” Bowser said as he just returned from a family trip in his hometown in Michigan.                                                                  In the Senior Division, Alan Morin, PGA Assistant Professional at The Club at Ibis, managed a two-day total of 7-under to win the Senior title by one over Justin Hicks, PGA, Paul Scaletta, PGA, and Brett Melton, PGA.                                                                  Over the 36-hole event, Morin managed two clean scorecards, as the only player in the field to go bogey-free.                                                                  Morin added his second win of the year after winning the South Florida Senior Open in May.

Leaderboard Christine Meier: Staying Connected to the Game She Loves By Tami Tolley • July 25, 2025 In the five years after graduating from Michigan State University, Christian Meier, PGA, took her Toyota Prius from 10,000 to over 300,000 miles, competing all across the country on the Symetra Tour (now Epson Tour).                                                                                                            A four-year starter for the Spartans, where she competed in 42 career events, won three Big 10 Conference titles, and boasted the 10th lowest scoring average in school history, Meier was set on making it to the highest level of women's golf.                                                                                                            Growing up in Rochester Hills, Michigan, Meier loved competing, and having an older sister who also played golf made that competitive drive even deeper. The two were talented junior golfers, often competing head-to-head as the only girls in junior events back home.                                                                                                            While Christine headed to Michigan State and her sister, Amy, to conference competitor Ohio State, the Meier sisters were carving their own paths. The summer following her sophomore year, Christine qualified for the U.S. Women's Open, becoming the first Spartan to qualify for the Major Championship while still in school. A year later, Amy qualified as well.                                                                                                            With both sisters having standout college careers, they hit the road together, traveling across the country, searching for their breakout opportunity. Christine's came in her second-to-last year on tour, but it was vastly different from what she initially envisioned.                                                                                                            While having an extensive break on her schedule, Christine came across a high school coaching position in Memphis, Tennessee. Not ready to give up on her playing aspirations, Christine saw this as an opportunity to do something different and get her mind off the grueling stretch of competitive golf.                                                                                                            \"The woman who hired me was Mary Murphy, a PGA Professional who teaches in Memphis and Olive Branch, Mississippi,\" explained Christine. \"She talked about the PGA Program a little bit, and I kind of brushed it off initially, not in a negative way, I was just still in the mindset of, I'm going to play, I'm a player.\"                                                                                                            The experience turned out to be extremely beneficial for Christine, who began falling in love with coaching—so much so that she came back the following season to coach for another 10 weeks.                                                                                                            This time, Christine was introduced to Jennifer Hudson, the PGA Director of Instruction at Sankaty Head Golf Club in Texas.                                                                                                            \"I saw what she did, she helped me with my game a little bit, and it started to look like a life I would enjoy,\" Christine recalled. \"It keeps you around the game, you learn a ton, and you get to meet a lot of other people. That may have nudged me in that direction more than I already was.\"                                                                                                            Throughout this entire time of playing professionally and coaching, Christine maintained a seasonal position inside the golf shop at The Club at Mediterra while working up north for a few seasons.                                                                                                            Following her second stint coaching, when Christine returned to Mediterra for the winter season, PGA Director of Golf Kevin Swan again encouraged her to enter the program.                                                                                                            Because of her time competing on tour and experience working at different facilities, Christine had the necessary knowledge to knock out the program.. Between the encouragement from Swan and others, Christine was all in on the PGA of America, becoming a Class-A Member in 2023.                                                                                                            While proud and happy with her new life in golf, Christine is not afraid to admit that the transition from playing full-time to now working in golf was incredibly daunting.                                                                                                            \"Golf was such a huge part of my identity that it was really difficult to wrestle with the potential of that not being the case anymore, not being able to be around the game, not playing a ton anymore,\" Christine explained. \"I really struggled with that idea.\"                                                                                                                         A few years into her full-time position with Mediterra, Christine is just as involved with the game as she ever was, only now in a different setting.                                                                                                                        \"It has been a perfect fit because I can still be around the game, which was so important to me,\" emphasized Christine. \"I never really want to lose that or the playing or teaching piece of it.\" Justin Hicks, PGA & Robbie Wight 3Peat at Pro-Scratch Championship July 24, 2025 Naples, FL                                               - For the third consecutive year, Justin Hicks, PGA, and Robbie Wight claim the Pro-Scratch Championship, presented by Srixon | Cleveland, played July 22-23 at Talis Park Golf Club and Grey Oaks Country Club.                                                                              Hicks and Wight first teamed up in the 2022 Pro-Scratch Championship, where they finished in the top-25. Since then, the duo has won three straight, making them the first pair to win three consecutive titles in the event's 45-year history.

With rain falling throughout the front nine of the final round for Hicks and Wight, they managed a 3-under performance, which saw them trail by two going into the final nine holes.
