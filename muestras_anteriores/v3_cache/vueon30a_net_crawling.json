From the bartenders to the servers and chef- we have received so many raving reviews! Ally & Connor We couldn’t be happier with our wedding at Vue on 30a! From start to finish, everything was absolutely amazing. The views are the best on 30a and the staff is so kind and accommodating! Every single guest commented on how great the food was (I’m still dreaming about the seafood pasta!) We can’t say enough great things about Vue on 30! Kendall S. I cannot recommend Vue on 30a as a wedding venue enough! The event specialist was amazing from start to finish. She was so quick to respond when I inquired about the venue and was happy to answer my questions about even the smallest details as I worked with my wedding planner to plan my wedding. My wedding day was absolutely perfect at Vue on 30a. Our guests had an amazing time and the staff was so wonderful to us. Our family and friends have wonderful memories and will treasure that day for years to come. Highly recommend Vue on 30a! Macy We had our rehearsal party here.
