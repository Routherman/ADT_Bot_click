Op-Ed Home Staff Advertise Advertisers Contact Blog Events Art Dining Business Charities Music SRQ Scoop Great Reading What's On? Op-Ed You are viewing: The Suncoast Post > Events > Nathan Benderson Park Awarded 2022-23 US Rowing Masters National Championships Search Nathan Benderson Park Awarded 2022-23 US Rowing Masters National Championships April 14, 2022 | Suncoast Post Staff | Events For the first time in nearly a decade, the nation’s best masters rowers will once again convene under the Florida sun. The 2022 and 2023 US Rowing Masters National Championships will be held at Nathan Benderson Park.  Nathan Benderson Park Conservancy will play host, with support from Visit Sarasota County. This year’s regatta will be Aug. 11-14, while next year’s regatta will be Aug. 10-13, 2023. The regattas will feature racing in more than 200 masters categories. “This recent awarding of the USRowing Masters Nationals is a telling tale of the benefits and success of Nathan Benderson Park and its operator, the Nathan Benderson Park Conservancy,” said Stephen V. Rodriguez, the Conservancy’s chief operating officer, and interim chief executive officer. “Being awarded a national championship event just four months away from the event date shows the park’s ability to be ready at a moment’s notice to take on new opportunities for the benefit of our community.” He said it’s a testament to “ the hard work of the Conservancy staff and the trust it has earned from event rights holders to be able to deliver. ” Rodriguez pointed to the park’s growing masters program, the NBP Community Rowing Club, and said its athletes, along with other masters programs in the community, will benefit by having the event in their backyard. “This is a benefit that is often overlooked when we announce that we are hosting events,” he said. “It isn’t just about bringing visitors to our area. It’s also about connecting our area athletes to competitive opportunities in their backyard.” NBP Programs and Aquatics Manager Miriam Ward said the regatta will be a shot in the arm. “I believe that Nathan Benderson Park having the opportunity to host USRowing Masters Nationals will be transformational for the NBP Community Rowing Club,” she said. “As the masters team grows and flourishes with a community-driven focus, it will be a chance to host the entire country’s fellow masters at our home base, welcoming everyone with open arms to show them what the NBP Community Rowing Club is all about.” Rowers obtain masters status in the year of their 21st birthday, according to USRowing. They compete in distinct age group classifications. When the USRowing Masters Nationals were at NBP in 2013, the venue was in its infancy, said Sarah McAuliffe, USRowing’s director of event planning and services. “We’re looking forward to hosting our masters athletes in Sarasota the next two years,” she said. “Since 2013, Sarasota has hosted several national championships and World Rowing events, including the highly-successful World Rowing Masters Regatta in 2018. We hope that all of our masters rowers will take advantage of the opportunity to race at this world-class venue.” The nation’s premier rowing venue, Nathan Benderson Park has hosted numerous national rowing events including the 2019 USRowing Youth National Championships and 2021 USRowing Youth National Regatta. The venue also has hosted premier international and trials events including the 2017 World Rowing Championships, 2018 World Rowing Masters Regatta and 2019 World Rowing Under 23 Championships, as well as the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – Rowing. The venue is slated to host the 2022 USRowing Youth National Championships this June and the 2022 USRowing Southeast Regional Championships and NCAA Women’s Rowing Championships for Divisions I, II and III in May. In addition to racing, rowers will be able to soak up the sun along Sarasota’s white-sand beaches or treat themselves to diverse dining, enriching arts and culture, shopping districts of all sorts, and natural Florida fun. “We are so thrilled to welcome the masters rowing community back to Sarasota County this summer and next,” said Virginia Haley, Visit Sarasota County president. “Our local hospitality partners always enjoy hosting masters athletes, and we look forward to working with them to provide a few special programs for attendees to experience all that Sarasota has to offer.” About USRowing: USRowing is a nonprofit organization recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee as the governing body for the sport of rowing in the United States.

      "text": "Nathan Benderson Park names new CEO News Sports Ticket Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals SARASOTA Nathan Benderson Park names new CEO Laura Finaldi lfinaldi@heraldtribune.com There’s a management shakeup going on at Nathan Benderson Park that indicates leadership is looking to the future. The nonprofit that runs the park, the Suncoast Aquatic Nature Center Associates Inc., has named Tomas Herrera-Mishler as its new CEO. Herrera-Mishler arrives in Sarasota from San Diego, where he was president and CEO of the 1,200-acre Balboa Park Conservancy for five years. The 600-acre Nathan Benderson Park sits just west of North Cattlemen Road and Interstate 75 in Sarasota. It features a 2,000-meter sprint rowing course and a regatta center. Current CEO Stephen Rodriguez will move into the chief operating officer role, focusing on day-to-day operations. Ronald Shapo, chairman of the SANCA board, said that the park is entering a new phase of growth and has to take the opportunity to capitalize on its potential. Last year, the park held 131 events, welcoming more than 150,000 participants. The park generated about $34.8 million in economic impact in its 2018-19 fiscal year. “We are very pleased that Tomas has agreed to assume the mantle of leadership of the park as we move forward,” Shapo said. “His unique background and skill set will be invaluable in helping us achieve our goals and maximize our future growth in a fiscally responsible and environmentally sensitive manner.” In his role at Balboa Park, Herrera-Mishler managed a $4.3 million operating budget and a staff of 26. The park includes the San Diego Zoo, 17 museum and 20 public gardens. Before that, his vast resume includes a stint as CEO and president of the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy in Buffalo, New York, where he helped to secure almost $30 million in capital improvement projects toward the implementation of the system’s master plan. Read more stories by Laura Finaldi He has also worked as the executive director of the Awbury Arboretum in Philadelphia, Airlie Gardens in Wilmington, North Carolina, and the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in Boston. A member of the World Urban Parks Organization and the City Parks Alliance, Herrera-Mishler has also served as co-chair of the American Society of Landscape Architects Parks and Recreation Professional Practice Group, and on many other boards. He started his career in Florida as a registered landscape architect at Wallace Roberts Todd in Coral Gables, where his projects included the master plans for the Ringling Museum and the Civic Center in Sarasota. “Nathan Benderson Park is a special community asset in Sarasota and an internationally recognized rowing facility. I am excited to be leading this venture to build and operate the finest park in our region, serving guests and residents through high-quality recreational amenities, fitness, events and programs in a beautiful park setting,” Herrera-Mishler said in a statement. Traditionally, fundraising for Nathan Benderson Park has been handled by the Nathan Benderson Community Park Foundation, Rodriguez said. Shapo said that SANCA took on some of its own fundraising responsibilities last year outside of the foundation, but that the the foundation also does fundraising work. One of Herrera-Mishler’s major responsibilities will be community outreach, Shapo said. “It is clear that the community as a whole doesn’t know a lot about the park, if anything, in many instances,” he said. “It’s very important that we have a representative, Tomas, as the face of the park, to begin engaging with the community and to have active outreach within the community. As a hopefully logical byproduct of that, we hope that that will also be significant in helping us with regards to fundraising, which we will be seeking to do, in a more active way which was not in our role previously.” Hiring someone of Herrera-Mishler’s caliber wasn’t within SANCA’s budget, Shapo said, so the foundation as well as a search committee began a private fundraising effort to put together the amount they would need to attract such a person. They secured about $200,000 before the CEO search began several months ago. Shapo did not disclose who contributed to the fund, only saying it was a group of people. In transitioning to chief operating officer, Rodriguez said the function of his job won’t change that much. His pay also isn’t changing, he said. “My day-to-day role in the organization really doesn’t change at all from what I do every day — operating the park, promoting the park, seeking events and creating new programs,” he said. “I do want to say we have an amazing team too. We have a great staff that works hard.” Rodriguez said the switch has been in the works for a while and makes sense for the future of the park. “When you look at the skill set Tomas has, he comes from the conservancy side and park development and design. My background has always been sports tourism events,” he said. “I think we have complementing skill sets and we should be a great team.” Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Sitemap Legals Public notice certification Our Ethical Principles USA TODAY Network Style Guide Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Advertiser Acceptance Policy Terms of Service Privacy Policy California Notice at Collection Your Privacy Choices Contact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Public Notices Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Submit Community News Subscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper Archives Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Shopping 10BEST LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions © 2025 www.heraldtribune.com.

The board of directors of the Suncoast Aquatic Nature Center Associates said Wednesday afternoon that it had appointed Florida Sports Foundation executive Stephen V. Rodriguez to lead SANCA starting in August. The change comes two months before the park holds the area's biggest international sporting event, the World Rowing Championships, which are expected to attract 40,000 people to the park from Sept. 24 to Oct. 1. In May, after holding the job for nine months, CEO Bob Sullivan had told the board and Sarasota County, which owns the park, that he intended to leave at the end of the year. Rodriguez, 44, has more than 25 years of event marketing and management experience and more than 13 years of professional experience in the sports industry. Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now. SANCA chairman Bill Robinson said Rodriguez is right for the job and gave a nod to the work of Sullivan and the organization's first CEO, Paul Blackketter. “Stephen’s expertise in sports promotion combined with his background marketing the state of Florida as a premier sports destination meshes impeccably with SANCA’s mission,” Robinson said. “Paul created NBP, Bob has maintained it, and we are confident Stephen will propel it in into the future!” A graduate of the University of Florida, Rodriguez spent 18 years at the Florida Sports Foundation, where he had been senior vice president since 2010. The foundation is a non-profit corporation that is the sports industry development division of Enterprise Florida Inc., which works to attract jobs and businesses to the state. At the foundation, Rodriguez was responsible for administration, event planning, finance, fundraising, government relations, program management, tourism and economic development. He is also the longest-standing director of the statewide Sunshine State Games and the Florida Senior Games. Before joining the foundation, he worked for the Palm Beach County Sports Commission and Sports Institute, where he ran the county's Unified Youth Sports Program and the Lou Groza Collegiate Place Kicker compeition. He also managed events such as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Spring Championship Games. Before Palm Beach, he was the office manager and membership chairman of the USA Track & Field/Florida Association. The Gainesville native is living in Palm Harbor and planning to move to Manatee County, a SANCA spokeswoman said. “Nathan Benderson Park has established itself as a world renowned rowing center and versatile county park that hosts numerous events for the entire community to enjoy.  I couldn’t be more excited to bring my experience and passion for the entire area to SANCA,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “I look forward to working with the SANCA staff and board, as well as the Sarasota County government, in taking NBP to the world stage, beginning with the World Rowing Championships in September, NCAA Women’s Rowing Championships in 2018, and 2018 World Rowing Masters Regatta.” Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Sitemap Legals Public notice certification Our Ethical Principles USA TODAY Network Style Guide Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Advertiser Acceptance Policy Terms of Service Privacy Policy California Notice at Collection Your Privacy Choices Contact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Public Notices Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Submit Community News Subscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper Archives Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Shopping 10BEST LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions © 2025 www.heraldtribune.com.
