The location is just over a mile from the closest public beach but we usually went to one of the state park locations about 3 miles away.  The resort is on water that connects two bays.  I believe they call it Old River.  There is a “beach” area at the docks for the marina, which is part of the resort.  It is an interesting blend of RVers and boaters.  The resort has a nice pool, laundry room and a clean bath house, although there is only one shower in both bathrooms.  The RV pads are gravel, well maintained, level but narrow.  Full hook-ups all around.  We found the sewage hook-up a little high causing some aggravation getting the sewage to flow even with an elevator. Our pad was right next to the pool and laundry which was convient.  There is a high bridge close by which had some road noise but wasn’t too bad.  We had no issues with other camper noise. The internet service and cable tv hook-ups worked very well.  There is Publix and Winn-Dixie grocery stores just on the other side of the bridge about 5 minutes away.  Perdido Key is a great beach area that is not commercialized like nearby Pensacola Beach or Destin are.  We seldom had issues finding parking or space on the beach.

We were able to safely ride our bikes on the sidewalk to the public beach that wasn’t far at all.  There’s also a public dog park/beach not far from the RV park.  The little beach at the RV park is right where the house boats anchor and so it’s a little awkward to sit for a while as you feel you’re looking into their living room windows.\nThe pool is nice - there’s a shaded canopy area on the side of the pool.\nPerdido Key is a very quiet town with not a lot to do and shuts down pretty early. The public beach at the end of the road was hard to find a parking spot - very small parking lot with limited parking. Site 54 Month of Visit May (19) View All Share Report B Brenda R. Scout Reviewed Apr. 13, 2022 Nice but priceyv People here are really friendly. Facilities are clean and well-kept. During our stay the water main broke and it took a day or so before you could use the shower or laundry. They called in plumber crew right away. WI-FI was adequate for work VPN but not enough bandwidth for streaming movies or running audio on Webex calls. Location is great - near beaches and parks but the location is under a high bridge so traffic noise is always present. Didn’t realize cost would be $118 per night for an RV site when the State Park charges $50. Site RV pull-through Month of Visit March Share Report M Martin R. Traveler Reviewed Mar. 24, 2022 Nice place nice staff The staff was very accommodating we arrived a day early and they found us a spot and we were able to move to our spot on the water a day later. The park is very dog friendly they provide poop bags for clean up it has a little beach next to the marina just a little bit of road noise from the bridge that crosses onto Perdido Key. We had a problem with our water heater cracking we found out when we got here we called reliable RV repair and Jimmy the owner came out and fixed it within an hour he work straight through dinner till about 830 to finish. Five stars for Jimmy as well. There is a dog park just over a mile away with a swimming area for dogs. It is close to the grocery store and numerous restaurants. Highly recommend Fishermans corner which is directly across the bridge for a good seafood at a reasonable price but I would recommend going early unless you have a reservation because they book up quickly. Very pleasant place and stay. Would highly recommend. Site 5 Month of Visit March (4) View All Share Report C Candace Traveler Reviewed Jan. 7, 2022 Very Friendly Staff!

The owners and staff will go above and beyond to make your stay pleasant and memorable.  Lots to do nearby.  Great view from the raised beach overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway.  They have marina slips to rent so you can bring your boat along.  The showers and restrooms were cleaned several times daily.  There is a clubhouse to meet for coffee in the morning, watch a movie or just chill.  A must place to stay in the area! Helpful 4 Own this park?

Staff was not very friendly.  Pool was dirty all of April until they switched cleaning services then it was great. Not many campers until holiday weekends. Noise from the highway was very annoying. Most mornings we were awakened by noisy neighbors before 7 am.  Staff was out mowing 4-5 days a week. Site was level and great wifi until it rained.  Nice paved walking path.  Rather expensive. Might go back. Helpful 1 Own this park? Reply to this review Jay and Carmen 1 reviews · 1 review votes Member 5 5 out of 5 stars 04/15/2016 We stay here every summer!

The pool was clean but not heated. It was very quiet in the park over the weekend which was a little surprising considering the Blue Angels had a homecoming which the park choose to incur a increased nightly charge.

The owners and staff will go above and beyond to make your stay pleasant and memorable.  Lots to do nearby.  Great view from the raised beach overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway.  They have marina slips to rent so you can bring your boat along.  The showers and restrooms were cleaned several times daily.  There is a clubhouse to meet for coffee in the morning, watch a movie or just chill.  A must place to stay in the area! Helpful 4 Own this park?

Staff was not very friendly.  Pool was dirty all of April until they switched cleaning services then it was great. Not many campers until holiday weekends. Noise from the highway was very annoying. Most mornings we were awakened by noisy neighbors before 7 am.  Staff was out mowing 4-5 days a week. Site was level and great wifi until it rained.  Nice paved walking path.  Rather expensive.

We enjoyed our stay at this RV park. It’s small and quaint. We found it to be quiet; so much that we urged our grandchildren to not make too much noise. They enjoyed the pool and we visited the private beach one day while there. The neighbors were friendly. It wasn’t fully packed, but had very few open sites. We would love to get a waterfront spot but I’m told those get booked sometimes a year in advance. We will certainly try again when planning our next trip. The bathroom was clean as was the laundry room. It had ample washing machines and dryers. We’ve been to much larger parks  that only had 1-2 machines. The resort was clean and looks to be well maintained. There is no playground for children to play. We took ours to the Perdido Kids Park, which they loved. The resort is close to the beach and many good restaurants. Check in was quick and easy and the office staff was friendly and helpful. We didn’t use the clubhouse but it looks to be a great gathering place. The ice cream truck visits on Fridays. Overall a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend and visit again. Rose Smith March 21, 2025 This place has a great location.  It's clean and everyone is nice. They have some really nice features like a small pool, laundry area, shower stall, a small beach area, a clubhouse with TV and coffee and popcorn, and a small dog beach area. The RV sites were nice and big, they had table tops  on the beach area that was cool.  They are located close to a beach (3-5 minutes maybe) and a TON of restaurants.\nOnly downside is if you have a dog, trying to find a grassy area they might 'go' on that isn't the 'lawn' of another camper is sparse, but still possible.\nI would recommend staying here, plenty of space for big RVs. scott heineman March 04, 2025 One of the nicest RV Resorts we've been to. Attention to detail is incredible. Owner wakes up early every morning to make a fresh pot of coffee and spend time talking to his guests.Pool temp high 80's. Great location. Walking distance to top rated restaurants. Bike path all the way to public beaches and shopping. Sherri Marshall February 15, 2025 We just spent 10 days at a back in RV spot. Absolutely wonderful. Loved having the sand a few steps out the door, along with the marina. So relaxing and clean. The staff is all so friendly, and lots of activities including food trucks. Close to shopping, restaurants, Perdido Key beach, Pensacola Naval Aviation Museum, and a wonderful dog park with a beach. We loved it so much we already booked for next year. Samantha Neal December 22, 2024 I absolutely love staying here! The views of the water are stunning as you can watch the boats go by, and there’s always something fun to do with a variety of activities available. The pool is perfect—heated in the winter and cooled in the summer, so you can enjoy it year-round. The sites are ideal for relaxing, with plenty of space to set up our chairs and take in the beautiful surroundings. On top of all that, the workers are incredibly friendly and always make you feel welcome. It’s the perfect place to unwind and enjoy View All Reviews ( 10 ) Would like to leave a review?
