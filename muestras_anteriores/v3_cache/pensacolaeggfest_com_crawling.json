Pensacola EggFest organizer said the once-weekend event has now turned into more than 20 events throughout the year. (Pensacola Egg Fest) Escambia County Pensacola EggFest donates record $113,500 to local charities by: Christopher Lugo Posted: Feb 14, 2023 / 10:30 AM CST Updated: Feb 14, 2023 / 10:31 AM CST Pensacola EggFest organizer said the once-weekend event has now turned into more than 20 events throughout the year. (Pensacola Egg Fest) by: Christopher Lugo Posted: Feb 14, 2023 / 10:30 AM CST Updated: Feb 14, 2023 / 10:31 AM CST SHARE PENSACOLA, Fla. ( WKRG ) — According to officials with the charity barbecue event Pensacola EggFest, the 2022 event doubled what organizers gave away in 2021, a record $113,500. “There’s a lot of love in our heart for the Pensacola area and for the charities that have been a part of Pensacola EggFest over the last 10 years,” Co-founder Lisa Lyter said. “When we total it all up, Pensacola EggFest has given more than $650,000 dollars to local charities. Those charities are kids who won’t go to bed hungry, kids fighting cancer who will get more research, and families who will feel safer in our communities.” FORECAST: Get the latest local forecast from the WKRG First Alert Storm Team Pensacola charities who are recipients of the 2022 Pensacola EggFest donations include Pensacola’s Finest Foundation, Manna, Rally Pensacola, Studer Community Institute, Hunting for Healing, Escambia County Fire Rescue, Escambia County Sheriff’s Office Foundation and PACE Center for Girls. Co-founder Doug Jolly said the once-weekend event has now turned into more than 20 events throughout the year. “People are really starting to notice what Pensacola EggFest is doing throughout the year as much as our November event,” Jolly said. “Our cook teams mobilize to serve thousands of meals to thousands of deserving people — volunteers working for a local cause, businesses who lost everything in a storm, families in need.” Organizers said the Pensacola EggFest, sponsored by Kia Pensacola, has become a destination event. They said economic impact to Pensacola has been verified at over $200,000 for just the main event. Cook teams, judges and visitors come from Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Louisiana.

When we got to the Eggfest, we were showered with attention.  People flocked to the booth asking questions, looking for details, and asking where to purchase. We got the signal we were looking for.  We also had people raving about the great character of the crust and taste of our pizza.  We kept hearing that the pizza was somehow better than their usual Big Green Egg Pizza. This year we returned to the Pensacola Eggfest having cooked a couple hundred pizzas.  We also brought some units to launch Escambia Electric, the Eggfest dealer in Pensacola.  It was a great \"homecoming\" for us.  Thank you to the organizing committee and all of the volunteers who put this spectacular event together for the community.  We are humbled by the amazing impact that the Pensacola Eggfest has on this community. 161113 Pensacola EggFest-3 161113 Pensacola EggFest-1 Our day was again filled with curious onlookers and eager taste-testers.  We showed people how to stretch dough and how to load pizzas into the oven.  The pizzas again received fantastic feedback.  We earned pizza cred from quite a few skeptical fans who had never had pizza that good out of an egg (or as some said, even at a local pizza joint).  A steady, 650-700F degree oven does wonderful things to good pizza dough.  Thanks to all those who supported us for people's choice with their tips! 161113 Pensacola EggFest-2 161113 Pensacola EggFest-8 We were then honored when we got called down for the award ceremony!  The Pizza-Porta Peelers team was awarded the \"Spirit of Eggfest\" award.  It was fantastic to be recognized, and we are grateful for the award. And we got to hang out with Big Mo!  I want to thank my ever-dedicated support team for shopping, making the trip, serving, busing, cleaning, and being fantastic friends.

Doug Jolly, Moe Cason, Lisa Long Lyter, and Jerold Hall at Pensacola Eggfest, 2018. Photo: Camera and Flask Need to chat with someone on the Pensacola Eggfest Team this week?  Well, I’m about the only one in town! Advertisement Because it is the week of the World Championship BBQ Contest at Memphis in May ! While I (and when I say “I”, I mean my husband) am securing the left-behind grills in prep for this coming storm, the grilling team joined our dear friend, Champion Moe Cason on Monday afternoon with our newest trailer in tow. The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest (WCBCC) is the largest pork barbecue contest in the world and has been featured on the Food Network. The largest collection of championship-winning teams has arrived at Liberty Park in Midtown Memphis to vie for the coveted title of Memphis in May World Champion, and they lit the grills yesterday for the first time this week. This year, 22 states are represented and four foreign countries.  The teams come prepared to compete in three categories:  whole hog, shoulders, and ribs. Moe Cason, of Moe Cason BBQ, is a familiar face in Pensacola as he has been a celebrity judge at Pensacola Eggfest eight out of the ten years we have thrown our BBQ party each November. In 2013, I read about Moe Cason and his love for BBQ and sent him an unsolicited email explaining that we were planning a BBQ competition fundraiser.  I shared how we had a beautiful condo on the beach for him to vacation in if he would consider joining us.  He replied two days later, “Yes, Lisa.  Call me on Tuesday” and that was the beginning of what we now refer to as the birth of our BBQ family adding to the original crew. This is the 46th edition of this beloved Memphis tradition and the Moe Cason team returns after placing 3 rd in 2023 for shoulders (the field last year was filled with 300+ teams). Moe is a straight champion by himself and is the winner of many championships (competing in over 250) along with starring on Destination America’s “BBQ Pit Masters”, “BBQ Pit Wars”, and “Smoked”.  He has also served as a judge on several Food Network shows. When Moe packs up on Monday after the contest is completed, he will head to New York for his guest appearance on Good Morning America. He will be sharing with ABC’s viewers the stories behind his brand new, just-off-the-press cookbook that went live on May 7 th .   His cookbook is filled with his favorite recipes.  It also offers the easy going, expert guidance he offers freely to those who want to learn how to cook perfectly seasoned collard greens and fall-apart tender Texas brisket.  Want a signed copy?  Stay tuned for details as he will be at Bodacious Bookstore and Cafe on June 22, 2024. The Pensacola Eggfest team is in their 8 th year of assisting Moe in his quest for an additional life-size trophy from the World Championships.  Leading Moe’s team as Captain is Doug Jolly (co-owner of Local Pulse). He is joined this year by Jerold Hall, Luke Gipp, Sean Norenberg, Schyler Sheffield and Kevin Winnegar.   Additionally, Michael Jeffries of the Big Smoke BBQ Company has flown in from New Zealand.  You may recognize the name and the man as he catered the VIP lamb dinner for Pensacola Eggfest this past year and you couldn’t stop talking about how delicious it was!  And Brian and Shelley Gurney of Bad Bones BBQ arrive this evening. There will be many laughs, late nights stoking the fire, a few sips of bourbon here and there, and some professional-level name-calling.  And at the end of it? My prediction is this…..the strongest of brotherhoods known as the Moe Cason BBQ team will be called to the stage to be awarded once again. I am super proud of these guys, my BBQ family, and I don’t tell them enough.  Here is to bringing home the championship and some solid memories!

Advertisement I’m beginning to think I should have used a baseball analogy rather than boxing, considering how many rounds I’ve now introduced. So stretch as if it’s the 7th inning stretch then get back into the ring with me to check out our latest contender. The excitement growing, Pensacola. A new venue, new cook teams, new flavors, and new judges (don’t worry some are returning), are all coming together to make this charity event one for the record books. This next cook team is not new to Pensacola Eggfest. In fact, they brought home the 2nd place Judges Award AND the 2nd place People’s Choice Award both years they’ve participated. How’s that for consistency? This year marks their 3rd round and they’re comin’ out swingin’. Meet Team Rocket Five. Rocket Five is the perfect fusion of two different businesses—Rocket Drones and Five Star Custom Flooring—brought together by their shared love for grilling and having a good time with loved ones. Together, they’ve blended Asian, Brazilian, and deep Southern cooking styles to create something truly unique. Pensacola Eggfest is the only BBQ competition they do, because it supports an incredible cause and gives them a chance to hear feedback from the amazing Pensacola community they love. What you don’t know about Team Rocket Five: Their secret ingredient: “At team Rocket Five, the secret ingredient is diversity! With flavors inspired by our team’s roots in Brazil, the Philippines, Texas, and Florida, we bring together spices and grilling techniques that aren’t just traditional backyard BBQ fare. From Brazilian-style picanha to a Filipino twist on pork belly, we’re all about serving up the unexpected. Our secret is to keep things fresh and adventurous—if it’s not making your taste buds dance, it’s not coming off our grill!” If they could only cook with one ingredient: “Hands down, without a doubt, it’s gotta be Brazilian rock salt. There’s something about its simplicity that just speaks to the soul of BBQ. It’s our go-to for everything from a thick, juicy ribeye to a perfectly grilled chicken. For us, rock salt is that happy place where the flavor of the meat shines, and sometimes in life, it’s the simple things that make all the difference!” The most unexpected dish you’ve cooked on the Big Green Egg: “Grilled cheese—literally! We’re not talking about the sandwich, though. We toss blocks of Brazilian queijo coalho straight onto the grill. It’s one of those ‘wait, can you actually do that?’ moments, but when it comes off with that perfect smoky char, it’s a game-changer.” Their best BBQ fail or mishap: “Never let the chimichurri sauce run out!” (Amen to that!) If Team Rocket Five could have one famous person (current or historical) on their cook team it would be: “It’d be Dave Chappelle. His sense of humor would fit right in with our crew, and I can only imagine the hilarious commentary while we’re grilling. Plus, you know he’d keep things laid-back and fun, which is exactly the vibe we love to bring to every BBQ.” The Smack Talk: “Honestly, whoever can keep up with us! We’re bringing the heat, the flavor, and some unexpected twists, so if they can hang, they’re the ones to beat.” Pensacola Eggfest will take place at Noon (or earlier if you snag a VIP ticket which are 95% sold out), Sunday November 10th, 2024, at Hadji Temple, 800 W 9 Mile Rd, Pensacola, FL 32534 .  The event hosts BBQ teams and backyard cooks from all over the United States who share two things: a love of cooking and the joy of giving back to their communities.  Since 2013, over $780,000 has been donated to local charities from this little BBQ party and the Pensacola Eggfest team is ready to push it over the $1 million mark with your help. Come join them to taste all the good food. (Click here for Tickets!) Better yet, grab some friends and join us as a cook team. (Click here to learn more and register your team.) Best of luck, Team Rocket Five! The Pensacola BBQ fans can’t wait to taste what you’re grillin’ up in just a couple of weeks! Peace, Love, and BBQ!
