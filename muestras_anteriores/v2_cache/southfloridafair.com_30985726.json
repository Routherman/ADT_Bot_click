In past years we’ve had everything from flesh-eating zombies to twisted carnivals, haunted prisons, evil clowns, haunted hotels, ghostly graveyards, insane asylums, corn mazes, haunted hayrides, Psychotic hillbillies and more! Located at the South Florida Fairgrounds in West Palm Beach, we have ACRES of scares and plenty of parking.\nof\nTranscript\nDescription\nFright Nights is an annual Halloween event that occurs at the South Florida Fairgrounds in West Palm Beach, Florida. Open through the beginning of October through Halloween, the event features multiple haunted houses, “scare zones,” midway rides, food vendors, games, and live entertainment.\nThe Beginning\nFright Nights has a long history in South Florida. It first started as a smaller venue on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach 23 years ago and as it grew it moved to the South Florida Fairgrounds. Today Fright Nights is not just a haunted attraction – it offers food, entertainment and Midway carnival rides – making Fright Nights the largest Screampark in South Florida.\nThe event boasts over 150 “Scare actors” and volunteers. Each haunted house has its own design team and is changed from year to year.\nFright Nights has created a number of lead characters that return each year. These characters include: Eggman, Dr. Harry Gooch, Bradley P. Diddle, Squid and Dots the clown.\nof\nTranscript\nFacilities\nThe INDOOR haunts are typically hosted in the 25,000 square foot Agriplex facility, while the southern parking tract is utilized as the “midway” containing rides, shows, games, and concessions. The lines are covered under a large gazebo structure (so no worries abut rain) and features live entertainment. We have acres of parking so everyone is welcome!\nFright Nights is put on by the\nSouth Florida Fair\n, a non-profit organization.\nAbout the South Florida Fair\nThe South Florida Fair & Palm Beach County Expositions, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation 501 (C3) organized and existing pursuant to Chapter 616, Florida Statutes.\nIt has a Board of Trustees comprised of seventeen (17) individuals who are responsible for setting policy and seeing that management of the association is carried out under direction of an executive staff consisting of the President/CEO and at present, a Vice President and four Division Directors.\nThe Fair also has Directors who serve in an advisory capacity. There are presently fifty-five (55) Directors. The Trustees and Directors are non-paid volunteers. The day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the President, Matt Wallsmith, who oversees a staff of over 45 full-time employees.\nTHE FAIRGROUNDS\nApproximately 135 acres comprise the real property commonly referred to as the “Fairgrounds”. In 1957, Palm Beach County gave the Fair 100 acres at its present site but later took back 20 acres for the stockade. This contribution was made in consideration of the Fair agreeing to relocate from John Prince Park in order that the County could vie for a state university (PBCC).\nGenerally, the Fairgrounds is segregated into several pods or tracts: the parking tracts, Yesteryear Village, the iTHINK Financial Amphitheatre, and the exhibit buildings, including the Expo Center and the AGZone. The space available on the Fairgrounds for trade shows and exhibits exceeds 200,000 square feet.

Even though agriculture is such a tremendous part of Palm Beach County’s economic base, many school children have never been exposed to it. However, at the annual South Florida Fair, not only can they see and learn all about agriculture, but can even witness a calf being born, or learn how a dairy is operated.\nThe annual fair attracts over 500,000 people through its turnstiles.\nHowever, 650,000 people will attend various events on the Fairgrounds on an annual basis.
