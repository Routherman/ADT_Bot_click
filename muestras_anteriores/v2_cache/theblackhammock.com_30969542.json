We do not charge an entry fee to visit our site and we offer a FREE live alligator exhibit as well.\nWe also do not feed, harass or interact with the abundant bird population or wildlife and we are witnessing more and more successful breeding species every year. Wild Boar, White-tailed Deer, Marsh Rabbits and Alligator Gar also inhabit the lake as well and can be seen on occasion.  We embrace the seasonal birds, plant life, amazing cypress trees, thousands of alligators and the general wonder of this ecosystem.\nHistory\nOn May 22, 1837, Lieutenant Peyton, with a command of twenty men and four Creek Indians, set out from Fort Mellon to explore the little known upper reaches of the St Johns River. They camped that night on what is now aptly known as Bird Island on Lake Jesup. One hundred and sixty four years later to the day, four members of Seminole Audubon Society, accompanied by two biologists from St Johns River Water Management District, surveyed birds on the island, finding an amazing 512 wading birds.\nhidden widget 336-6fda2a9\nQuick Links\nBoat Tours\nOrlando Airboat Rides – Packages\nLodging\nFood and Drinks\nMenu\nLazy Gator Bar\nRestaurant\nSpecials\nSpecial Event\nExplore\nGift Shop\nExplore Natural Florida\nGroups and Events\nBanquet Room\nCommunity\nUpcoming Events\nBlog\nContact Us\nBoat Tours\nOrlando Airboat Rides – Packages\nLodging\nFood and Drinks\nMenu\nLazy Gator Bar\nRestaurant\nSpecials\nSpecial Event\nExplore\nGift Shop\nExplore Natural Florida\nGroups and Events\nBanquet Room\nCommunity\nUpcoming Events\nBlog\nContact Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nCONTACT\n407-365-1244\n2316 Black Hammock Fish Camp Road Oviedo, FL 32765\nRestaurant\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday - Thursday: 11 a.m. - 8:30 p.m.\nFriday - Sunday: 11 a.m. -  9 p.m.\nAirboat Rides\nTuesday - Sunday: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nLazy Gator Bar\nTuesday - Thursday: 12 p.m. - 11:0 p.m.\nFriday and Saturday: 10 a.m. - 1 a.m.\nSunday: 10 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.\nFROM OUR GUESTS\nGoogle Reviews\nConnect With Us\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYoutube\nIcon-tiktok\n© 2024 The Black Hammock  •\nSite Map\n•  Website by\nZgraph\n, Inc.

After 5:00 pm there is a charge of $20 per party when available.\nAre there age requirements?\nThere are no age/height requirements for our airboat rides. Children under 2 years of age may sit in your lap or ride beside you. Children under 6 years of age are required to wear a life vest and ear protection which we provide for you. Children under 6 are also required to wear eye protection (such as sunglasses, which can be purchased in the gift shop or brought from home). We also highly recommend eye protection for adults.\nWhat is the best time to ride?\nThe alligators and wildlife are more active in the morning and evening hours during the summer months and mid-afternoon in the winter months.\nWhat is the appropriate attire?\nSummer / Fall:\nDress light, wear sunblock, sunglasses and bring comfortable shoes.\nWinter / Spring:\nWear layered clothing to ensure comfort.\nAm I guaranteed to see gators?\nOur Captains are experienced in and will do their best to seek out the locations in which alligators frequent. Lake Jesup is the most alligator populated lake in Florida. Each tour is unique and quite unpredictable. During the warmer months, the morning rides are better and during the colder months, the warmer hours are best for airboat tours.\nWhat kind of equipment do you use?\nLife vest and ear protection are provided to all of our passengers. Children under six years of age are required to wear life vests and ear protection we provide, and eye protection, such as sunglasses (can be purchased in the gift shop). Eye protection is also highly recommended for adults. Eye protection can be brought from home (glasses, sunglasses, goggles, etc) or purchased in our gift shop.\nAre pets allowed on the boat?\nUnfortunately,  we are not able to accommodate your pet on the airboat tours or near the waters. For your safety, the safety of your pet, and the safety of others we do not allow pets down the peninsula or on our airboat tours. Service animals are permitted but we do advise against it, again, for safety.",

His family moved to Africa when he was young, and there he grew up surrounded by the magnificent wildlife. He spent a lot of his youth out in the jungles hunting snakes, alligators and other creatures. His survival skills were honed by his many African and Malgache friends.\nHe returned to France to do his tour of duty. He chose to be in the Navy which had their base at Toulon, in the beautiful south of France. After his tour of duty was over, he settled in Corsica, where he opened a restaurant and nightclub. He also had a small ranch where he could ride his horses.\nAfter 12 years spent in Corsica, he decided to open a franchise of mini supermarkets in several ski resorts in the French Alps.\nThe lure of the French Riviera drew Joel and family. There he went to open a real estate company. But all plans changed in 1995, when he won a green card and was allowed to emigrate to America. Without hesitation, he packed up the family and moved to the States. Joel chose Florida as he enjoys the heat and humidity, so reminiscent of his youth.\nHis choice of lifestyle led him to the Oviedo area where he could live in the country and keep his horse. On a morning walk one day he discovered that not 5 minutes away is the Black Hammock Restaurant, on lovely Lake Jesup, with it’s mangroves and alligators. Now he knows he is in paradise! He is at home just as he was in Africa.\nJoel obtained his American Citizenship, fully living out his AMERICAN DREAM!\nTo further improve Black Hammock Adventures’ air boat business Joel obtained his Master Airboat License. He, as well as all of Black Hammock’s airboat pilots, have their Master Airboat Captain License.\nQuick Links\nBoat Tours\nOrlando Airboat Rides – Packages\nLodging\nFood and Drinks\nMenu\nLazy Gator Bar\nRestaurant\nSpecials\nSpecial Event\nExplore\nGift Shop\nExplore Natural Florida\nGroups and Events\nBanquet Room\nCommunity\nUpcoming Events\nBlog\nContact Us\nBoat Tours\nOrlando Airboat Rides – Packages\nLodging\nFood and Drinks\nMenu\nLazy Gator Bar\nRestaurant\nSpecials\nSpecial Event\nExplore\nGift Shop\nExplore Natural Florida\nGroups and Events\nBanquet Room\nCommunity\nUpcoming Events\nBlog\nContact Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nCONTACT\n407-365-1244\n2316 Black Hammock Fish Camp Road Oviedo, FL 32765\nRestaurant\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday - Thursday: 11 a.m. - 8:30 p.m.\nFriday - Sunday: 11 a.m. -  9 p.m.\nAirboat Rides\nTuesday - Sunday: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nLazy Gator Bar\nTuesday - Thursday: 12 p.m. - 11:0 p.m.\nFriday and Saturday: 10 a.m. - 1 a.m.\nSunday: 10 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.\nFROM OUR GUESTS\nGoogle Reviews\nConnect With Us\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYoutube\nIcon-tiktok\n© 2024 The Black Hammock  •\nSite Map\n•  Website by\nZgraph\n, Inc.
