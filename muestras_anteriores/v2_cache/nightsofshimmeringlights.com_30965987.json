Walk at your own pace and stop as often as you like. Enjoy Winterland full of blue and white lights, penguins, bears, old man winter and other favorite scenes. Don’t miss the Nativity scene and Star of David in our Religious area. Who can miss Santa and the reindeer in the Christmas area? Rest on one of the many benches conveniently placed along the trail or take selfies at one of our photo stops. Get in the holiday spirit with seasonal music and themed areas.\nBe sure to wear good footwear as the trail can be uneven in spots. Sorry, it is not suitable for strollers or wheelchairs at this time. Remember to stay inside the light lines as bad things can get you on the outside of the lines. Seriously, it can be dangerous outside the lines with wires to trip on, rough terrain, tree roots and even a shallow creek nearby. We don’t want to lose any of our guests.\nDidn’t get enough the first time through? Try it again and again—as many times as you like.\nWhen you need a break, be sure to stop at our Holiday Village for light refreshments, watch a seasonal movie on our big screen, play some games or take pictures at our photo spot.\nfusion-row\nSpecial Events\nMake Memories to Last a Lifetime\nEach season, you can experience something different when you visit Shimmering Lights at Sun Kissed Acres.
