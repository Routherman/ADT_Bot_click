The project also will construct strategic water quality structures to address existing water resource issues and expand partnership projects to address nutrient loading in local waterbodies.\nImplementation of these projects will improve the water quality of local waterbodies. Many Polk County lakes and streams are impaired and have routine high concentrations of nutrients and E. coli. Establishing regional treatment wetlands have proven to be a good tool to reduce the pollutant loading in local waterbodies. This project protects public health, especially in disadvantaged and rural areas. Water quality in Florida is important for public health by reducing the amount of nutrients and limiting the number of harmful algal blooms (HAB). Some HAB produce harmful toxins that affect human health and have been attributed to illness in pets. These projects will address surface water quality in disproportionately impacted communities through bringing water quality management.\nPeace River Watershed Water Quality Improvement\nThis project along the Peace Creek Canal would create a corridor of wetland treatment systems. The project provides surface water quality treatment, increases reliability of water in the Peace Creek Canal, provides increased flood protection of lands along the canal, improves drainage of the watershed and enhances water storage in the Peace Creek Canal.\nPartnerships with Polk Regional Water Cooperative, local municipalities, state water management districts and others will implement projects that have the most potential for regional water quality improvement with side benefits of water storage and flood protection.\nImplementing Small Scale Surface Water Enhancement/Treatment Projects\nPolk County identified areas where small-scale surface water enhancements would be applicable and create a beneficial treatment to stormwater. Opportunities exist for developing small-scale surface water quality improvement projects that were identified in a series of feasibility studies, water quality management plans and alternate restoration plans.\nThe project enhances water quality treatment for stormwater entering local lakes.\nTargeted priority service area:\nPeace River watershed\nPeace Creek Canal\nVarious rural communities\nCommunity Engagement\nThe Polk County Stormwater Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) was established and appointed by the Polk County Board of County Commissioners to provide guidance and assistance in matters dealing with stormwater runoff, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater permit requirements, maximizing best management practice treatment efficiencies and improving surface water quality. The advisory committee is a volunteer advisory group. The meetings are advertised and open to the public.\nStormwater education is an important part of the county’s actions to address surface water pollution. Polk County participates in several outreach events annually and funds the maintenance of the Polk County Water Atlas, which provides the community with information on the water quality of our area and projects that improve the protection of our water resources.\nPerformance Measures\nOutput Measures\nNumber of residents who benefit from cleaner water\nNumber of residents who have access to improved managed public lands\nNumber of residents who have access to outdoor spaces to recreate and improve personal health\nDemographic Information of residents within a 20-mile buffer of project\nOutcome Measures\nPercent reduction of total phosphorous\nPercent reduction of total nitrogen\nNumber of waterbodies treated with stormwater infrastructure implementation\nGovernment Infrastructure: Stormwater Infrastructure-Alleviate Flooding and improve Water Quality\nPriority Category:\nInfrastructure – Stormwater\nFunding Amount:\n$23,557,000\nManaging Department:\nRoads & Drainage Division\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nTo mitigate stormwater flooding in areas of Polk County that continually flood during heavy rains as well as manage and treat groundwater.\nDescription\nPolk County experiences frequent and unpredictable tropical systems most commonly from June 1 through November 30. The greatest risk is during August and September. These systems can drop tremendous amounts of rain in very short periods of time. Most casualties caused by hurricanes are the result of flooding.\nAbout 46 percent of Polk County is designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area. Polk is also a rapidly urbanizing county, with new residential neighborhoods being developed near natural wetlands. According to newly released Census data, Polk County saw a 12.5 percent growth in its availability of housing units during the last decade. This growth will not slow and projections show the county will surpass 1 million residents by 2040.\nThe Roads and Drainage Division has identified 17 projects throughout the county to help mitigate stormwater flooding. These projects were selected based upon the greatest need for stormwater control, which would impact the most residents. Project design will begin in October 2021, with construction beginning in 2022.\nMajor projects that help with drainage, as well as helping to manage and treat groundwater, include:\nImperial Lakes Phase 1 along Imperial Lakes Boulevard;\nLake Victoria outfall drainage;\nNorthwest Wahneta;\nSouth Lake Wales pipe upgrades and retention ponds; and\nIndian Woods Trail/North Campbell Road in north Lakeland.\nCommunity Engagement\nThe stormwater projects identified are included in the Roads and Drainage Division’s Fiscal Year 2021 – 2025 Community Investment Plan and presented during the county’s annual CIP Presentation in August 2021. Community engagement will also be accomplished through social media and programming on PGTV and on the county website.\nPerformance Measures\nComplete design and  permitting for 17 identified projects with one to two years of the funding award\nComplete construction of designed projects to eliminate stormwater flooding within two to five years of funding the projects\nGovernment Infrastructure: Water Utilities Infrastructure\nPriority Category:\nPublic Health – Water and Wastewater Treatment\nFunding Amount:\n$37,680,000\nManaging Department:\nPolk County Utilities (PCU)\nExisting or New Project:\nNew and existing\nPurpose:\nNecessary investments in water and sewer infrastructure\nDescription\nPolk County Utilities projects funded with the county’s ARP Act appropriation will be used to construct new infrastructure to replace failing collection and treatment systems, final design for alternative water supply projects, design and construct three new septage receiving facilities at each of three regional wastewater treatment facilities and pilot test reclaimed water treatment to potable water standards.\nPRWC Southeast Wellfield\nThe project includes the final design of the Southeast wellfield, which is an alternative water supply project envisioned by the Polk Regional Water Cooperative (PRWC), that will benefit Polk County and other participating members. The project will supply potable water needs for current and future residents and businesses of Polk County. Additionally, the work will protect groundwater supplies and surface features, such as wetlands, springs, rivers and other water bodies in an environmentally safe manner.\nPRWC West Polk Wellfield\nThe project will supply potable water needs for current and future residents and businesses of Polk County. The project includes the final design of the West Polk Lower Floridan Wellfield and WTF which is an alternative water supply project envisioned by the Polk Regional Water Cooperative (PRWC), benefitting Polk County and other participating members.\nCrooked Lake Park Wastewater\nFunds are proposed to construct new infrastructure to replace failing collection and treatment systems. The project includes upgrades to the existing collection system, which includes two new lift stations, replacement of the existing force main and repair/lining of manholes and gravity sewer. The project also includes the demolition of the existing facility and construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver the wastewater to an established facility. Progress to date includes point repairs of collection system, replacement of force main and cleaning of treatment system to restore capacity. Challenges include a lack of information on the existing system, such as mapping and customer base.\nBriarwood Estates Lift and Force Main\nThe existing system frequently overflows untreated wastewater into public access areas. This project includes the construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver wastewater from the failing package plant serving Briarwood Estates to the county’s Northwest Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility. The project includes the demolition of the existing facility and construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver the wastewater to an established facility. Challenges include lack of information on the existing system, such as mapping and customer base, the condition of the existing collection system, and adequate right-of-way along the proposed pipeline corridor.\nSeptage and FOG Receiving Facilities\nSeptage is currently spread on open fields, potentially leaching nutrient-rich product into groundwater nearby water bodies. Opportunities include treatment and disposal of septage in lieu of ground application. These funds will be used to design and construct three new septage receiving facilities at regional wastewater treatment facilities. The project also includes the construction of a receiving facility for fats, oils and greases (FOG) at one of the regional wastewater treatment facilities. Progress to date includes a preliminary investigation report from the county’s consulting engineer.\nCherry Hill Alternative Water Supply\nPolk County has a cooperative agreement with the Southwest Florida Water Management District to pilot test reclaimed water treatment to potable water standards at the new Cherry Hill Water processing facility. Potable reuse is a process that purifies water from wastewater treatment plants through advanced treatment methods to meet drinking water standards. The potable reuse study in Polk County will feature a Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) process, which is where purified wastewater is introduced into a drinking water treatment facility.\nPolk/Lakeland/Bartow and Polk/Auburndale/Winter Haven Interconnects\nThese two interconnect projects include construction of a potable water interconnect to provide emergency potable water service among the water providers. These will provide emergency interconnects of potable water to insure safe drinking water and fire flow protection for the respective service areas. The projects may also serve as part of the AWS delivery system.\nCybersecurity Improvements\nPolk County Utilities will purchase and implement software to monitor for unauthorized devices accessing the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) control system for water and wastewater facilities.\nCommunity Engagement\nAll projects will directly benefit economically disadvantaged communities. Polk Utilities will work with the Communications Division to provide educational materials and public forums for the public, especially in communities directly affected by system upgrades. Our partnerships with SWFWMD projects have extensive requirements for public education.\nPerformance Measures\nDesign, permitting and construction of separate processes\nCompletion of construction documents for completed projects\nReduction in sanitary sewer overflows and compliance with regulatory permit requirements\nPercentage of growth in businesses receiving assistance\nGovernment Infrastructure: Facilities\nPriority Category:\nCapital Projects\nFunding Amount:\n$2,610,000\nManaging Department:\nFacilities Management\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nSupport COVID-19 response efforts to continue to decrease spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.\nDescription\nPolk County’s Administration Building was constructed in 1989 and much of the HVAC system is more than 30 years old. The funding for this project will allow Polk County to provide facility repairs and improvements to enable operations of county government to reduce risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards. County Administration Building HVAC upgrades and Code Enforcement renovation will include engineering services, remodeling, inspections, testing, maintenance, repair, replacement and upgrade projects to improve the indoor air quality and better social distancing. Design will begin in January 2022 with construction beginning May 2022.\nPerformance Measures\nProvide a safe building environment for residents to conduct county business\nProvide a safe environment for more than 300 employees to work\nComplete design for this HVAC project\nComplete construction of this project\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Constitutional Officers and County Administration\nPriority Category:\nGovernment Services\nFunding Amount:\n$46,200,000\nManaging Department:\nBudget and Management Services Division\nExisting or New Project:\nNew and existing\nPurpose:\nEfforts to decrease the spread of the virus, and provide and strengthen public services\nDescription\nLocal government stepped up in response to the COVID-19 crisis, when the State of Florida filed executive orders that shutdown all but the most essential services in March and April 2020. First responders from public safety and public health providers were overwhelmed with calls, the emergency management system scurried to locate and provide personal protection equipment, employees who could work remotely were sent home, laptops and portable technology became scarce and broadband was taxed to keep up with the increased demand. The list of changes, and challenges, continues.\nCounty leaders will use ARP Act funds to replace lost revenue and make necessary investments in rebuilding their workforces and technology to bring the county back to pre-pandemic levels of service.\nBoard of County Commissioners\nThe Board will use funds for testing, PPE and other COVID-related costs, as well as hire outside agencies to administer programs within the U.S. Treasury guidelines for the expenditure of funds.\nPolk County currently leverages the Accela Land Management application to manage permitting and land management for the Building, Codes, and Land Development divisions. This project will migrate the application from an on-premise implementation to a cloud-based solution within Accela’s cloud environment. It will improve the existing permitting environment by facilitating the process of approving building and land permits and enforcing code violations. Once the application has been migrated, residents will be able to apply and access their permits directly through Accela’s servers rather than through Information Technology. This will prevent local resource constraints (power outages, Internet outages, bandwidth congestion restrictions) from impacting the availability of the application.\nClerk of Courts\nThe Florida Supreme Court halted jury trials and other court services for several months at the beginning of the pandemic. Employees were laid off. In June 2021, the courts lifted the remaining COVID-19 restrictions, resuming pre-pandemic operations. The Clerk of Courts needs additional in-person staffing and struggles to recruit, hire and train a workforce that can help reduce the backlog of cases caused by closures during the pandemic. In addition to staffing, the Clerk must purchase technology for a larger workforce.\nProperty Appraiser\nWith more employees working remotely, the Property Appraiser requires more laptops and better technology to accommodate them. The Property Appraiser also requests funding for gloves, masks and other personal protective equipment for employees.\nSheriff\nWith courts closed to jury trials and other cases backlogged, the Sheriff has an increased jail population. Another challenge is maintaining CDC social distance protocols when transferring inmates from the jail to the courthouse for in-person hearings. The Sheriff requests funds for additional deputies to staff for the increase in inmates due to the court backlog. The Sheriff is also asking for funding for emergency communication booths in the South County Jail, so inmates can converse with legal staff and appear before judges virtually, rather than in person.\nSupervisor of Elections\nThe Supervisor of Elections’ requests ARP funds for an online election worker training platform to reduce the number of in-person training classes. The Supervisor of Elections also will need additional electronic poll books for precinct use and cleaning supplies and disinfectant materials.\nTax Collector\nDue to staffing shortages, and the number of his employees who are working remotely, walk-in and telephone services at the Tax Collector’s Office are experiencing extended wait-times. The Tax Collector is encouraging residents to use online and mail-in services whenever possible. The Tax Collector requests additional funding for technology and additional sheriff’s deputies to maintain distancing requirements in his offices.\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Health Emergencies\nPriority Category:\nPublic Health\nFunding Amount:\n$1,000,000\nManaging Department:\nRisk Management\nExisting or New Project:\nExisting\nPurpose:\nCOVID-19-Related Health Costs\nDescription\nPolk County government will reimburse its self-funded workers’ compensation fund for COVID-19 related medical expenses incurred by the county’s first responders. The county will also reimburse its self-funded health fund for COVID-19 related medical expenses incurred by employees, spouses and dependents who participate in the county-sponsored health insurance plan. Expenses for both categories are ongoing as the pandemic continues.\nPerformance Measures\nReimbursement will strengthen the financial position of both funds\nReimbursement will lessen the possibility of premium increases borne by employees for the county health fund\nReimbursement to the workers’ compensation fund will improve the loss history and positively affect underwriting and excess insurance premiums\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Information Technology\nPriority Category:\nBroadband Infrastructure\nFunding Amount:\n$250,000\nManaging Department:\nInformation Technology\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nNecessary investments in broadband infrastructure\nDescription\nBroadband Study\nThe Board recommended that the county complete a broadband study that will identify if opportunities exist for funding broadband programs and services in underserved areas. Additionally, identified opportunities should include improved Internet access at the county’s multiple locations, including fire stations, parks and community centers. The Information Technology Division does not have the ability to perform this study internally and has requested the assistance of Florida Polytechnic University to partner with the county on this project.\nPerformance Measures\nBroadband – Completed report provided by selected vendor\nCommunity and Public Health\nThe American Rescue Plan Act authorizes the use of appropriated funds for Polk County to respond to public health emergencies caused by COVID-19, or its negative economic impacts. Community organizations and nonprofits have requested funding from the county to include:\nContinued testing and vaccines;\nBehavioral health programs and facility construction;\nFood security operations and facility purchase/remodeling;\nNonprofit assistance to agencies providing services to residents;\nHomelessness prevention; and\nAfter-school programs for low income, at risk children.\nAgencies representing these services will make presentations to the Board this fall. The Board will allocate resources from the county’s ARP at that time.\nSmall Business Assistance\nPriority Category:\nEconomic Stabilization\nFunding Amount:\nTo Be Determined\nManaging Department:\nCentral Florida Development Council (CFDC)\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nDevelop and manage new programs that will assist small businesses, along with women and minority owned businesses, in recuperating from pandemic impacts and provide business planning to insure their future growth.\nDescription\nIn 2020, the Central Florida Development Council was a key partner to the county in dispersing approximately $20 million of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funds. Thousands of businesses, which were forced to close or reduce services and deemed non-essential, received some relief to be able to stay open for business.\nThe Board of County Commissioners will give future guidance as to the final determination of the American Rescue Plan appropriation to Polk County for small business development. The CFDC will oversee three programs in fiscal years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 that will help small, women and minority-owned businesses expand as they recover from lost revenues due to the pandemic.\nMatching Infrastructure Grants\nMatching grants up to $25,000 to small businesses with five to 100 employees will be awarded to invest in ways that will bring customers back to their businesses. These businesses must be in leased or owned commercial space, and be used for utilities, infrastructure improvements and/or industry certification costs.\nBusiness Resiliency\nThe CFDC will work with Florida Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) to add one, possibly two, SBDC consultants to help businesses become more resilient to future adversities. Today, business owners wanting SBDC assistance must travel to Orlando or Tampa. Adding consultants would re-establish a SBDC presence in Polk.\nWomen and Minority-owned Small Business Assistance\nThe CFDC will work with Sylvia Blackmon-Roberts to develop a program for small, women and minority-owned businesses to get assistance with technology and back-office work that will help them thrive and grow in Polk County. There is an offer of a $500,000 matching grant to help support this program.\nCommunity Engagement\nThrough its website, chambers of commerce, social media and advertising, the CFDC will market these programs throughout Polk County. Business owners, most likely, will be able to apply for infrastructure grants through an online portal, similar to applications for CARES funds in 2020. The SBDC will follow their statewide procedures for marketing their program.

The project also will construct strategic water quality structures to address existing water resource issues and expand partnership projects to address nutrient loading in local waterbodies.\nImplementation of these projects will improve the water quality of local waterbodies. Many Polk County lakes and streams are impaired and have routine high concentrations of nutrients and E. coli. Establishing regional treatment wetlands have proven to be a good tool to reduce the pollutant loading in local waterbodies. This project protects public health, especially in disadvantaged and rural areas. Water quality in Florida is important for public health by reducing the amount of nutrients and limiting the number of harmful algal blooms (HAB). Some HAB produce harmful toxins that affect human health and have been attributed to illness in pets. These projects will address surface water quality in disproportionately impacted communities through bringing water quality management.\nPeace River Watershed Water Quality Improvement\nThis project along the Peace Creek Canal would create a corridor of wetland treatment systems. The project provides surface water quality treatment, increases reliability of water in the Peace Creek Canal, provides increased flood protection of lands along the canal, improves drainage of the watershed and enhances water storage in the Peace Creek Canal.\nPartnerships with Polk Regional Water Cooperative, local municipalities, state water management districts and others will implement projects that have the most potential for regional water quality improvement with side benefits of water storage and flood protection.\nImplementing Small Scale Surface Water Enhancement/Treatment Projects\nPolk County identified areas where small-scale surface water enhancements would be applicable and create a beneficial treatment to stormwater. Opportunities exist for developing small-scale surface water quality improvement projects that were identified in a series of feasibility studies, water quality management plans and alternate restoration plans.\nThe project enhances water quality treatment for stormwater entering local lakes.\nTargeted priority service area:\nPeace River watershed\nPeace Creek Canal\nVarious rural communities\nCommunity Engagement\nThe Polk County Stormwater Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) was established and appointed by the Polk County Board of County Commissioners to provide guidance and assistance in matters dealing with stormwater runoff, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater permit requirements, maximizing best management practice treatment efficiencies and improving surface water quality. The advisory committee is a volunteer advisory group. The meetings are advertised and open to the public.\nStormwater education is an important part of the county’s actions to address surface water pollution. Polk County participates in several outreach events annually and funds the maintenance of the Polk County Water Atlas, which provides the community with information on the water quality of our area and projects that improve the protection of our water resources.\nPerformance Measures\nOutput Measures\nNumber of residents who benefit from cleaner water\nNumber of residents who have access to improved managed public lands\nNumber of residents who have access to outdoor spaces to recreate and improve personal health\nDemographic Information of residents within a 20-mile buffer of project\nOutcome Measures\nPercent reduction of total phosphorous\nPercent reduction of total nitrogen\nNumber of waterbodies treated with stormwater infrastructure implementation\nGovernment Infrastructure: Stormwater Infrastructure-Alleviate Flooding and improve Water Quality\nPriority Category:\nInfrastructure – Stormwater\nFunding Amount:\n$23,557,000\nManaging Department:\nRoads & Drainage Division\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nTo mitigate stormwater flooding in areas of Polk County that continually flood during heavy rains as well as manage and treat groundwater.\nDescription\nPolk County experiences frequent and unpredictable tropical systems most commonly from June 1 through November 30. The greatest risk is during August and September. These systems can drop tremendous amounts of rain in very short periods of time. Most casualties caused by hurricanes are the result of flooding.\nAbout 46 percent of Polk County is designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area. Polk is also a rapidly urbanizing county, with new residential neighborhoods being developed near natural wetlands. According to newly released Census data, Polk County saw a 12.5 percent growth in its availability of housing units during the last decade. This growth will not slow and projections show the county will surpass 1 million residents by 2040.\nThe Roads and Drainage Division has identified 17 projects throughout the county to help mitigate stormwater flooding. These projects were selected based upon the greatest need for stormwater control, which would impact the most residents. Project design will begin in October 2021, with construction beginning in 2022.\nMajor projects that help with drainage, as well as helping to manage and treat groundwater, include:\nImperial Lakes Phase 1 along Imperial Lakes Boulevard;\nLake Victoria outfall drainage;\nNorthwest Wahneta;\nSouth Lake Wales pipe upgrades and retention ponds; and\nIndian Woods Trail/North Campbell Road in north Lakeland.\nCommunity Engagement\nThe stormwater projects identified are included in the Roads and Drainage Division’s Fiscal Year 2021 – 2025 Community Investment Plan and presented during the county’s annual CIP Presentation in August 2021. Community engagement will also be accomplished through social media and programming on PGTV and on the county website.\nPerformance Measures\nComplete design and  permitting for 17 identified projects with one to two years of the funding award\nComplete construction of designed projects to eliminate stormwater flooding within two to five years of funding the projects\nGovernment Infrastructure: Water Utilities Infrastructure\nPriority Category:\nPublic Health – Water and Wastewater Treatment\nFunding Amount:\n$37,680,000\nManaging Department:\nPolk County Utilities (PCU)\nExisting or New Project:\nNew and existing\nPurpose:\nNecessary investments in water and sewer infrastructure\nDescription\nPolk County Utilities projects funded with the county’s ARP Act appropriation will be used to construct new infrastructure to replace failing collection and treatment systems, final design for alternative water supply projects, design and construct three new septage receiving facilities at each of three regional wastewater treatment facilities and pilot test reclaimed water treatment to potable water standards.\nPRWC Southeast Wellfield\nThe project includes the final design of the Southeast wellfield, which is an alternative water supply project envisioned by the Polk Regional Water Cooperative (PRWC), that will benefit Polk County and other participating members. The project will supply potable water needs for current and future residents and businesses of Polk County. Additionally, the work will protect groundwater supplies and surface features, such as wetlands, springs, rivers and other water bodies in an environmentally safe manner.\nPRWC West Polk Wellfield\nThe project will supply potable water needs for current and future residents and businesses of Polk County. The project includes the final design of the West Polk Lower Floridan Wellfield and WTF which is an alternative water supply project envisioned by the Polk Regional Water Cooperative (PRWC), benefitting Polk County and other participating members.\nCrooked Lake Park Wastewater\nFunds are proposed to construct new infrastructure to replace failing collection and treatment systems. The project includes upgrades to the existing collection system, which includes two new lift stations, replacement of the existing force main and repair/lining of manholes and gravity sewer. The project also includes the demolition of the existing facility and construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver the wastewater to an established facility. Progress to date includes point repairs of collection system, replacement of force main and cleaning of treatment system to restore capacity. Challenges include a lack of information on the existing system, such as mapping and customer base.\nBriarwood Estates Lift and Force Main\nThe existing system frequently overflows untreated wastewater into public access areas. This project includes the construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver wastewater from the failing package plant serving Briarwood Estates to the county’s Northwest Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility. The project includes the demolition of the existing facility and construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver the wastewater to an established facility. Challenges include lack of information on the existing system, such as mapping and customer base, the condition of the existing collection system, and adequate right-of-way along the proposed pipeline corridor.\nSeptage and FOG Receiving Facilities\nSeptage is currently spread on open fields, potentially leaching nutrient-rich product into groundwater nearby water bodies. Opportunities include treatment and disposal of septage in lieu of ground application. These funds will be used to design and construct three new septage receiving facilities at regional wastewater treatment facilities. The project also includes the construction of a receiving facility for fats, oils and greases (FOG) at one of the regional wastewater treatment facilities. Progress to date includes a preliminary investigation report from the county’s consulting engineer.\nCherry Hill Alternative Water Supply\nPolk County has a cooperative agreement with the Southwest Florida Water Management District to pilot test reclaimed water treatment to potable water standards at the new Cherry Hill Water processing facility. Potable reuse is a process that purifies water from wastewater treatment plants through advanced treatment methods to meet drinking water standards. The potable reuse study in Polk County will feature a Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) process, which is where purified wastewater is introduced into a drinking water treatment facility.\nPolk/Lakeland/Bartow and Polk/Auburndale/Winter Haven Interconnects\nThese two interconnect projects include construction of a potable water interconnect to provide emergency potable water service among the water providers. These will provide emergency interconnects of potable water to insure safe drinking water and fire flow protection for the respective service areas. The projects may also serve as part of the AWS delivery system.\nCybersecurity Improvements\nPolk County Utilities will purchase and implement software to monitor for unauthorized devices accessing the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) control system for water and wastewater facilities.\nCommunity Engagement\nAll projects will directly benefit economically disadvantaged communities. Polk Utilities will work with the Communications Division to provide educational materials and public forums for the public, especially in communities directly affected by system upgrades. Our partnerships with SWFWMD projects have extensive requirements for public education.\nPerformance Measures\nDesign, permitting and construction of separate processes\nCompletion of construction documents for completed projects\nReduction in sanitary sewer overflows and compliance with regulatory permit requirements\nPercentage of growth in businesses receiving assistance\nGovernment Infrastructure: Facilities\nPriority Category:\nCapital Projects\nFunding Amount:\n$2,610,000\nManaging Department:\nFacilities Management\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nSupport COVID-19 response efforts to continue to decrease spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.\nDescription\nPolk County’s Administration Building was constructed in 1989 and much of the HVAC system is more than 30 years old. The funding for this project will allow Polk County to provide facility repairs and improvements to enable operations of county government to reduce risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards. County Administration Building HVAC upgrades and Code Enforcement renovation will include engineering services, remodeling, inspections, testing, maintenance, repair, replacement and upgrade projects to improve the indoor air quality and better social distancing. Design will begin in January 2022 with construction beginning May 2022.\nPerformance Measures\nProvide a safe building environment for residents to conduct county business\nProvide a safe environment for more than 300 employees to work\nComplete design for this HVAC project\nComplete construction of this project\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Constitutional Officers and County Administration\nPriority Category:\nGovernment Services\nFunding Amount:\n$46,200,000\nManaging Department:\nBudget and Management Services Division\nExisting or New Project:\nNew and existing\nPurpose:\nEfforts to decrease the spread of the virus, and provide and strengthen public services\nDescription\nLocal government stepped up in response to the COVID-19 crisis, when the State of Florida filed executive orders that shutdown all but the most essential services in March and April 2020. First responders from public safety and public health providers were overwhelmed with calls, the emergency management system scurried to locate and provide personal protection equipment, employees who could work remotely were sent home, laptops and portable technology became scarce and broadband was taxed to keep up with the increased demand. The list of changes, and challenges, continues.\nCounty leaders will use ARP Act funds to replace lost revenue and make necessary investments in rebuilding their workforces and technology to bring the county back to pre-pandemic levels of service.\nBoard of County Commissioners\nThe Board will use funds for testing, PPE and other COVID-related costs, as well as hire outside agencies to administer programs within the U.S. Treasury guidelines for the expenditure of funds.\nPolk County currently leverages the Accela Land Management application to manage permitting and land management for the Building, Codes, and Land Development divisions. This project will migrate the application from an on-premise implementation to a cloud-based solution within Accela’s cloud environment. It will improve the existing permitting environment by facilitating the process of approving building and land permits and enforcing code violations. Once the application has been migrated, residents will be able to apply and access their permits directly through Accela’s servers rather than through Information Technology. This will prevent local resource constraints (power outages, Internet outages, bandwidth congestion restrictions) from impacting the availability of the application.\nClerk of Courts\nThe Florida Supreme Court halted jury trials and other court services for several months at the beginning of the pandemic. Employees were laid off. In June 2021, the courts lifted the remaining COVID-19 restrictions, resuming pre-pandemic operations. The Clerk of Courts needs additional in-person staffing and struggles to recruit, hire and train a workforce that can help reduce the backlog of cases caused by closures during the pandemic. In addition to staffing, the Clerk must purchase technology for a larger workforce.\nProperty Appraiser\nWith more employees working remotely, the Property Appraiser requires more laptops and better technology to accommodate them. The Property Appraiser also requests funding for gloves, masks and other personal protective equipment for employees.\nSheriff\nWith courts closed to jury trials and other cases backlogged, the Sheriff has an increased jail population. Another challenge is maintaining CDC social distance protocols when transferring inmates from the jail to the courthouse for in-person hearings. The Sheriff requests funds for additional deputies to staff for the increase in inmates due to the court backlog. The Sheriff is also asking for funding for emergency communication booths in the South County Jail, so inmates can converse with legal staff and appear before judges virtually, rather than in person.\nSupervisor of Elections\nThe Supervisor of Elections’ requests ARP funds for an online election worker training platform to reduce the number of in-person training classes. The Supervisor of Elections also will need additional electronic poll books for precinct use and cleaning supplies and disinfectant materials.\nTax Collector\nDue to staffing shortages, and the number of his employees who are working remotely, walk-in and telephone services at the Tax Collector’s Office are experiencing extended wait-times. The Tax Collector is encouraging residents to use online and mail-in services whenever possible. The Tax Collector requests additional funding for technology and additional sheriff’s deputies to maintain distancing requirements in his offices.\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Health Emergencies\nPriority Category:\nPublic Health\nFunding Amount:\n$1,000,000\nManaging Department:\nRisk Management\nExisting or New Project:\nExisting\nPurpose:\nCOVID-19-Related Health Costs\nDescription\nPolk County government will reimburse its self-funded workers’ compensation fund for COVID-19 related medical expenses incurred by the county’s first responders. The county will also reimburse its self-funded health fund for COVID-19 related medical expenses incurred by employees, spouses and dependents who participate in the county-sponsored health insurance plan. Expenses for both categories are ongoing as the pandemic continues.\nPerformance Measures\nReimbursement will strengthen the financial position of both funds\nReimbursement will lessen the possibility of premium increases borne by employees for the county health fund\nReimbursement to the workers’ compensation fund will improve the loss history and positively affect underwriting and excess insurance premiums\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Information Technology\nPriority Category:\nBroadband Infrastructure\nFunding Amount:\n$250,000\nManaging Department:\nInformation Technology\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nNecessary investments in broadband infrastructure\nDescription\nBroadband Study\nThe Board recommended that the county complete a broadband study that will identify if opportunities exist for funding broadband programs and services in underserved areas. Additionally, identified opportunities should include improved Internet access at the county’s multiple locations, including fire stations, parks and community centers. The Information Technology Division does not have the ability to perform this study internally and has requested the assistance of Florida Polytechnic University to partner with the county on this project.\nPerformance Measures\nBroadband – Completed report provided by selected vendor\nCommunity and Public Health\nThe American Rescue Plan Act authorizes the use of appropriated funds for Polk County to respond to public health emergencies caused by COVID-19, or its negative economic impacts. Community organizations and nonprofits have requested funding from the county to include:\nContinued testing and vaccines;\nBehavioral health programs and facility construction;\nFood security operations and facility purchase/remodeling;\nNonprofit assistance to agencies providing services to residents;\nHomelessness prevention; and\nAfter-school programs for low income, at risk children.\nAgencies representing these services will make presentations to the Board this fall. The Board will allocate resources from the county’s ARP at that time.\nSmall Business Assistance\nPriority Category:\nEconomic Stabilization\nFunding Amount:\nTo Be Determined\nManaging Department:\nCentral Florida Development Council (CFDC)\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nDevelop and manage new programs that will assist small businesses, along with women and minority owned businesses, in recuperating from pandemic impacts and provide business planning to insure their future growth.\nDescription\nIn 2020, the Central Florida Development Council was a key partner to the county in dispersing approximately $20 million of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funds. Thousands of businesses, which were forced to close or reduce services and deemed non-essential, received some relief to be able to stay open for business.\nThe Board of County Commissioners will give future guidance as to the final determination of the American Rescue Plan appropriation to Polk County for small business development. The CFDC will oversee three programs in fiscal years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 that will help small, women and minority-owned businesses expand as they recover from lost revenues due to the pandemic.\nMatching Infrastructure Grants\nMatching grants up to $25,000 to small businesses with five to 100 employees will be awarded to invest in ways that will bring customers back to their businesses. These businesses must be in leased or owned commercial space, and be used for utilities, infrastructure improvements and/or industry certification costs.\nBusiness Resiliency\nThe CFDC will work with Florida Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) to add one, possibly two, SBDC consultants to help businesses become more resilient to future adversities. Today, business owners wanting SBDC assistance must travel to Orlando or Tampa. Adding consultants would re-establish a SBDC presence in Polk.\nWomen and Minority-owned Small Business Assistance\nThe CFDC will work with Sylvia Blackmon-Roberts to develop a program for small, women and minority-owned businesses to get assistance with technology and back-office work that will help them thrive and grow in Polk County. There is an offer of a $500,000 matching grant to help support this program.\nCommunity Engagement\nThrough its website, chambers of commerce, social media and advertising, the CFDC will market these programs throughout Polk County. Business owners, most likely, will be able to apply for infrastructure grants through an online portal, similar to applications for CARES funds in 2020. The SBDC will follow their statewide procedures for marketing their program. The county’s Supplier Diversity program will continue to partner with Blackmon-Roberts to reach women and minority-owned entrepreneurs.\nPerformance Measures\nNumber of businesses assisted with matching infrastructure grants\nNumber of new small businesses created\nNumber of small businesses that expand/recover from the pandemic\nPercentage of growth in businesses receiving assistance\nAmerican Rescue Plan Status Report\nIn March 2021, Congress signed into law the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act to deliver relief to families, businesses and government organizations impacted by the pandemic.\nPolk County received a $140.8 million appropriation to support urgent COVID-19 response efforts to control the spread of the virus, replace lost public sector revenue, support economic stabilization for the county, and to address necessary investments in water, sewer, stormwater and broadband infrastructure.

The project also will construct strategic water quality structures to address existing water resource issues and expand partnership projects to address nutrient loading in local waterbodies.\nImplementation of these projects will improve the water quality of local waterbodies. Many Polk County lakes and streams are impaired and have routine high concentrations of nutrients and E. coli. Establishing regional treatment wetlands have proven to be a good tool to reduce the pollutant loading in local waterbodies. This project protects public health, especially in disadvantaged and rural areas. Water quality in Florida is important for public health by reducing the amount of nutrients and limiting the number of harmful algal blooms (HAB). Some HAB produce harmful toxins that affect human health and have been attributed to illness in pets. These projects will address surface water quality in disproportionately impacted communities through bringing water quality management.\nPeace River Watershed Water Quality Improvement\nThis project along the Peace Creek Canal would create a corridor of wetland treatment systems. The project provides surface water quality treatment, increases reliability of water in the Peace Creek Canal, provides increased flood protection of lands along the canal, improves drainage of the watershed and enhances water storage in the Peace Creek Canal.\nPartnerships with Polk Regional Water Cooperative, local municipalities, state water management districts and others will implement projects that have the most potential for regional water quality improvement with side benefits of water storage and flood protection.\nImplementing Small Scale Surface Water Enhancement/Treatment Projects\nPolk County identified areas where small-scale surface water enhancements would be applicable and create a beneficial treatment to stormwater. Opportunities exist for developing small-scale surface water quality improvement projects that were identified in a series of feasibility studies, water quality management plans and alternate restoration plans.\nThe project enhances water quality treatment for stormwater entering local lakes.\nTargeted priority service area:\nPeace River watershed\nPeace Creek Canal\nVarious rural communities\nCommunity Engagement\nThe Polk County Stormwater Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) was established and appointed by the Polk County Board of County Commissioners to provide guidance and assistance in matters dealing with stormwater runoff, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater permit requirements, maximizing best management practice treatment efficiencies and improving surface water quality. The advisory committee is a volunteer advisory group. The meetings are advertised and open to the public.\nStormwater education is an important part of the county’s actions to address surface water pollution. Polk County participates in several outreach events annually and funds the maintenance of the Polk County Water Atlas, which provides the community with information on the water quality of our area and projects that improve the protection of our water resources.\nPerformance Measures\nOutput Measures\nNumber of residents who benefit from cleaner water\nNumber of residents who have access to improved managed public lands\nNumber of residents who have access to outdoor spaces to recreate and improve personal health\nDemographic Information of residents within a 20-mile buffer of project\nOutcome Measures\nPercent reduction of total phosphorous\nPercent reduction of total nitrogen\nNumber of waterbodies treated with stormwater infrastructure implementation\nGovernment Infrastructure: Stormwater Infrastructure-Alleviate Flooding and improve Water Quality\nPriority Category:\nInfrastructure – Stormwater\nFunding Amount:\n$23,557,000\nManaging Department:\nRoads & Drainage Division\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nTo mitigate stormwater flooding in areas of Polk County that continually flood during heavy rains as well as manage and treat groundwater.\nDescription\nPolk County experiences frequent and unpredictable tropical systems most commonly from June 1 through November 30. The greatest risk is during August and September. These systems can drop tremendous amounts of rain in very short periods of time. Most casualties caused by hurricanes are the result of flooding.\nAbout 46 percent of Polk County is designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area. Polk is also a rapidly urbanizing county, with new residential neighborhoods being developed near natural wetlands. According to newly released Census data, Polk County saw a 12.5 percent growth in its availability of housing units during the last decade. This growth will not slow and projections show the county will surpass 1 million residents by 2040.\nThe Roads and Drainage Division has identified 17 projects throughout the county to help mitigate stormwater flooding. These projects were selected based upon the greatest need for stormwater control, which would impact the most residents. Project design will begin in October 2021, with construction beginning in 2022.\nMajor projects that help with drainage, as well as helping to manage and treat groundwater, include:\nImperial Lakes Phase 1 along Imperial Lakes Boulevard;\nLake Victoria outfall drainage;\nNorthwest Wahneta;\nSouth Lake Wales pipe upgrades and retention ponds; and\nIndian Woods Trail/North Campbell Road in north Lakeland.\nCommunity Engagement\nThe stormwater projects identified are included in the Roads and Drainage Division’s Fiscal Year 2021 – 2025 Community Investment Plan and presented during the county’s annual CIP Presentation in August 2021. Community engagement will also be accomplished through social media and programming on PGTV and on the county website.\nPerformance Measures\nComplete design and  permitting for 17 identified projects with one to two years of the funding award\nComplete construction of designed projects to eliminate stormwater flooding within two to five years of funding the projects\nGovernment Infrastructure: Water Utilities Infrastructure\nPriority Category:\nPublic Health – Water and Wastewater Treatment\nFunding Amount:\n$37,680,000\nManaging Department:\nPolk County Utilities (PCU)\nExisting or New Project:\nNew and existing\nPurpose:\nNecessary investments in water and sewer infrastructure\nDescription\nPolk County Utilities projects funded with the county’s ARP Act appropriation will be used to construct new infrastructure to replace failing collection and treatment systems, final design for alternative water supply projects, design and construct three new septage receiving facilities at each of three regional wastewater treatment facilities and pilot test reclaimed water treatment to potable water standards.\nPRWC Southeast Wellfield\nThe project includes the final design of the Southeast wellfield, which is an alternative water supply project envisioned by the Polk Regional Water Cooperative (PRWC), that will benefit Polk County and other participating members. The project will supply potable water needs for current and future residents and businesses of Polk County. Additionally, the work will protect groundwater supplies and surface features, such as wetlands, springs, rivers and other water bodies in an environmentally safe manner.\nPRWC West Polk Wellfield\nThe project will supply potable water needs for current and future residents and businesses of Polk County. The project includes the final design of the West Polk Lower Floridan Wellfield and WTF which is an alternative water supply project envisioned by the Polk Regional Water Cooperative (PRWC), benefitting Polk County and other participating members.\nCrooked Lake Park Wastewater\nFunds are proposed to construct new infrastructure to replace failing collection and treatment systems. The project includes upgrades to the existing collection system, which includes two new lift stations, replacement of the existing force main and repair/lining of manholes and gravity sewer. The project also includes the demolition of the existing facility and construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver the wastewater to an established facility. Progress to date includes point repairs of collection system, replacement of force main and cleaning of treatment system to restore capacity. Challenges include a lack of information on the existing system, such as mapping and customer base.\nBriarwood Estates Lift and Force Main\nThe existing system frequently overflows untreated wastewater into public access areas. This project includes the construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver wastewater from the failing package plant serving Briarwood Estates to the county’s Northwest Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility. The project includes the demolition of the existing facility and construction of a new lift station and force main to deliver the wastewater to an established facility. Challenges include lack of information on the existing system, such as mapping and customer base, the condition of the existing collection system, and adequate right-of-way along the proposed pipeline corridor.\nSeptage and FOG Receiving Facilities\nSeptage is currently spread on open fields, potentially leaching nutrient-rich product into groundwater nearby water bodies. Opportunities include treatment and disposal of septage in lieu of ground application. These funds will be used to design and construct three new septage receiving facilities at regional wastewater treatment facilities. The project also includes the construction of a receiving facility for fats, oils and greases (FOG) at one of the regional wastewater treatment facilities. Progress to date includes a preliminary investigation report from the county’s consulting engineer.\nCherry Hill Alternative Water Supply\nPolk County has a cooperative agreement with the Southwest Florida Water Management District to pilot test reclaimed water treatment to potable water standards at the new Cherry Hill Water processing facility. Potable reuse is a process that purifies water from wastewater treatment plants through advanced treatment methods to meet drinking water standards. The potable reuse study in Polk County will feature a Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) process, which is where purified wastewater is introduced into a drinking water treatment facility.\nPolk/Lakeland/Bartow and Polk/Auburndale/Winter Haven Interconnects\nThese two interconnect projects include construction of a potable water interconnect to provide emergency potable water service among the water providers. These will provide emergency interconnects of potable water to insure safe drinking water and fire flow protection for the respective service areas. The projects may also serve as part of the AWS delivery system.\nCybersecurity Improvements\nPolk County Utilities will purchase and implement software to monitor for unauthorized devices accessing the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) control system for water and wastewater facilities.\nCommunity Engagement\nAll projects will directly benefit economically disadvantaged communities. Polk Utilities will work with the Communications Division to provide educational materials and public forums for the public, especially in communities directly affected by system upgrades. Our partnerships with SWFWMD projects have extensive requirements for public education.\nPerformance Measures\nDesign, permitting and construction of separate processes\nCompletion of construction documents for completed projects\nReduction in sanitary sewer overflows and compliance with regulatory permit requirements\nPercentage of growth in businesses receiving assistance\nGovernment Infrastructure: Facilities\nPriority Category:\nCapital Projects\nFunding Amount:\n$2,610,000\nManaging Department:\nFacilities Management\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nSupport COVID-19 response efforts to continue to decrease spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.\nDescription\nPolk County’s Administration Building was constructed in 1989 and much of the HVAC system is more than 30 years old. The funding for this project will allow Polk County to provide facility repairs and improvements to enable operations of county government to reduce risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards. County Administration Building HVAC upgrades and Code Enforcement renovation will include engineering services, remodeling, inspections, testing, maintenance, repair, replacement and upgrade projects to improve the indoor air quality and better social distancing. Design will begin in January 2022 with construction beginning May 2022.\nPerformance Measures\nProvide a safe building environment for residents to conduct county business\nProvide a safe environment for more than 300 employees to work\nComplete design for this HVAC project\nComplete construction of this project\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Constitutional Officers and County Administration\nPriority Category:\nGovernment Services\nFunding Amount:\n$46,200,000\nManaging Department:\nBudget and Management Services Division\nExisting or New Project:\nNew and existing\nPurpose:\nEfforts to decrease the spread of the virus, and provide and strengthen public services\nDescription\nLocal government stepped up in response to the COVID-19 crisis, when the State of Florida filed executive orders that shutdown all but the most essential services in March and April 2020. First responders from public safety and public health providers were overwhelmed with calls, the emergency management system scurried to locate and provide personal protection equipment, employees who could work remotely were sent home, laptops and portable technology became scarce and broadband was taxed to keep up with the increased demand. The list of changes, and challenges, continues.\nCounty leaders will use ARP Act funds to replace lost revenue and make necessary investments in rebuilding their workforces and technology to bring the county back to pre-pandemic levels of service.\nBoard of County Commissioners\nThe Board will use funds for testing, PPE and other COVID-related costs, as well as hire outside agencies to administer programs within the U.S. Treasury guidelines for the expenditure of funds.\nPolk County currently leverages the Accela Land Management application to manage permitting and land management for the Building, Codes, and Land Development divisions. This project will migrate the application from an on-premise implementation to a cloud-based solution within Accela’s cloud environment. It will improve the existing permitting environment by facilitating the process of approving building and land permits and enforcing code violations. Once the application has been migrated, residents will be able to apply and access their permits directly through Accela’s servers rather than through Information Technology. This will prevent local resource constraints (power outages, Internet outages, bandwidth congestion restrictions) from impacting the availability of the application.\nClerk of Courts\nThe Florida Supreme Court halted jury trials and other court services for several months at the beginning of the pandemic. Employees were laid off. In June 2021, the courts lifted the remaining COVID-19 restrictions, resuming pre-pandemic operations. The Clerk of Courts needs additional in-person staffing and struggles to recruit, hire and train a workforce that can help reduce the backlog of cases caused by closures during the pandemic. In addition to staffing, the Clerk must purchase technology for a larger workforce.\nProperty Appraiser\nWith more employees working remotely, the Property Appraiser requires more laptops and better technology to accommodate them. The Property Appraiser also requests funding for gloves, masks and other personal protective equipment for employees.\nSheriff\nWith courts closed to jury trials and other cases backlogged, the Sheriff has an increased jail population. Another challenge is maintaining CDC social distance protocols when transferring inmates from the jail to the courthouse for in-person hearings. The Sheriff requests funds for additional deputies to staff for the increase in inmates due to the court backlog. The Sheriff is also asking for funding for emergency communication booths in the South County Jail, so inmates can converse with legal staff and appear before judges virtually, rather than in person.\nSupervisor of Elections\nThe Supervisor of Elections’ requests ARP funds for an online election worker training platform to reduce the number of in-person training classes. The Supervisor of Elections also will need additional electronic poll books for precinct use and cleaning supplies and disinfectant materials.\nTax Collector\nDue to staffing shortages, and the number of his employees who are working remotely, walk-in and telephone services at the Tax Collector’s Office are experiencing extended wait-times. The Tax Collector is encouraging residents to use online and mail-in services whenever possible. The Tax Collector requests additional funding for technology and additional sheriff’s deputies to maintain distancing requirements in his offices.\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Health Emergencies\nPriority Category:\nPublic Health\nFunding Amount:\n$1,000,000\nManaging Department:\nRisk Management\nExisting or New Project:\nExisting\nPurpose:\nCOVID-19-Related Health Costs\nDescription\nPolk County government will reimburse its self-funded workers’ compensation fund for COVID-19 related medical expenses incurred by the county’s first responders. The county will also reimburse its self-funded health fund for COVID-19 related medical expenses incurred by employees, spouses and dependents who participate in the county-sponsored health insurance plan. Expenses for both categories are ongoing as the pandemic continues.\nPerformance Measures\nReimbursement will strengthen the financial position of both funds\nReimbursement will lessen the possibility of premium increases borne by employees for the county health fund\nReimbursement to the workers’ compensation fund will improve the loss history and positively affect underwriting and excess insurance premiums\nGeneral County Impacts and Mitigation: Information Technology\nPriority Category:\nBroadband Infrastructure\nFunding Amount:\n$250,000\nManaging Department:\nInformation Technology\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nNecessary investments in broadband infrastructure\nDescription\nBroadband Study\nThe Board recommended that the county complete a broadband study that will identify if opportunities exist for funding broadband programs and services in underserved areas. Additionally, identified opportunities should include improved Internet access at the county’s multiple locations, including fire stations, parks and community centers. The Information Technology Division does not have the ability to perform this study internally and has requested the assistance of Florida Polytechnic University to partner with the county on this project.\nPerformance Measures\nBroadband – Completed report provided by selected vendor\nCommunity and Public Health\nThe American Rescue Plan Act authorizes the use of appropriated funds for Polk County to respond to public health emergencies caused by COVID-19, or its negative economic impacts. Community organizations and nonprofits have requested funding from the county to include:\nContinued testing and vaccines;\nBehavioral health programs and facility construction;\nFood security operations and facility purchase/remodeling;\nNonprofit assistance to agencies providing services to residents;\nHomelessness prevention; and\nAfter-school programs for low income, at risk children.\nAgencies representing these services will make presentations to the Board this fall. The Board will allocate resources from the county’s ARP at that time.\nSmall Business Assistance\nPriority Category:\nEconomic Stabilization\nFunding Amount:\nTo Be Determined\nManaging Department:\nCentral Florida Development Council (CFDC)\nExisting or New Project:\nNew\nPurpose:\nDevelop and manage new programs that will assist small businesses, along with women and minority owned businesses, in recuperating from pandemic impacts and provide business planning to insure their future growth.\nDescription\nIn 2020, the Central Florida Development Council was a key partner to the county in dispersing approximately $20 million of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funds. Thousands of businesses, which were forced to close or reduce services and deemed non-essential, received some relief to be able to stay open for business.\nThe Board of County Commissioners will give future guidance as to the final determination of the American Rescue Plan appropriation to Polk County for small business development. The CFDC will oversee three programs in fiscal years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 that will help small, women and minority-owned businesses expand as they recover from lost revenues due to the pandemic.\nMatching Infrastructure Grants\nMatching grants up to $25,000 to small businesses with five to 100 employees will be awarded to invest in ways that will bring customers back to their businesses. These businesses must be in leased or owned commercial space, and be used for utilities, infrastructure improvements and/or industry certification costs.\nBusiness Resiliency\nThe CFDC will work with Florida Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) to add one, possibly two, SBDC consultants to help businesses become more resilient to future adversities. Today, business owners wanting SBDC assistance must travel to Orlando or Tampa. Adding consultants would re-establish a SBDC presence in Polk.\nWomen and Minority-owned Small Business Assistance\nThe CFDC will work with Sylvia Blackmon-Roberts to develop a program for small, women and minority-owned businesses to get assistance with technology and back-office work that will help them thrive and grow in Polk County. There is an offer of a $500,000 matching grant to help support this program.\nCommunity Engagement\nThrough its website, chambers of commerce, social media and advertising, the CFDC will market these programs throughout Polk County. Business owners, most likely, will be able to apply for infrastructure grants through an online portal, similar to applications for CARES funds in 2020. The SBDC will follow their statewide procedures for marketing their program. The county’s Supplier Diversity program will continue to partner with Blackmon-Roberts to reach women and minority-owned entrepreneurs.\nPerformance Measures\nNumber of businesses assisted with matching infrastructure grants\nNumber of new small businesses created\nNumber of small businesses that expand/recover from the pandemic\nPercentage of growth in businesses receiving assistance\nAmerican Rescue Plan Status Report\nIn March 2021, Congress signed into law the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act to deliver relief to families, businesses and government organizations impacted by the pandemic.\nPolk County received a $140.8 million appropriation to support urgent COVID-19 response efforts to control the spread of the virus, replace lost public sector revenue, support economic stabilization for the county, and to address necessary investments in water, sewer, stormwater and broadband infrastructure. All funds must be allocated by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026.\nThe county’s ARP Recovery Plan was published on August 31, 2021. It included detailed infrastructure project descriptions, with budgets, for Polk’s use of its appropriation. An update on the status of these projects is outlined below.",

Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or entire community; or they can be very large, affecting an entire regional river basin or multiple states.\nAll floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, possibly over a period of days, while others can develop quickly and without any visible signs of rain.\nIt is important to be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live. But it is especially important to be aware if you live in low-lying areas or near water. Very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds or low-lying grounds that appear harmless in dry weather can flood.\nTo see the potential flooding sources in your area\nvisit FEMA Flood Map Service Center\n.\nFlood Basics\nMyth\nFact\nMy homeowner's policy will cover any flood damage.\nNot all homeowner's policies cover flood damage. Check your policy and/or with your insurance agent. Flood insurance can also be purchased from FEMA.\nIt has never flooded here, so it never will.\nFloods are caused by weather conditions and are unpredictable. Flooding can occur anywhere under the right conditions.\nThere was a flood problem, but it has been fixed.\nAlthough some flooding issues can be mitigated it is very difficult to fix a flooding problem.\nIf flooding was a problem, someone would have told us.\nCheck with Polk County Floodplain Management at (863)  534-6765 to find out if an area has flooded in the past or to determine if you are in a\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area.\nIt's only water. It's no big deal to be flooded.\nEven a few inches of water can bring thousands of dollars in repair and restoration costs.\nWe just had a 100-year flood, so my family will be safe from future flooding for the rest of their lives.\nThe 100-year flood has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. Statistically, there is more than a 1 in 4 chance of this type of flood occurring during a 30-year mortgage; however, they can occur much more frequently.\nDifferent Flood Zones\nFlood zones are land areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\nFEMA\n). Each flood zone describes that land area in terms of its risk of flooding. Everyone lives in a flood zone–it’s just a question of whether you live in a low, moderate or high-risk area.\nRisk Level Catagory\nFlood Hazard Zone\nHigh Flood Risk\nAE, A, AH or AO Zone. These properties have a one percent chance of flooding in any year and a 26 percent chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage.\nInsurance Note: High-risk areas are called\nSpecial Flood Hazard Areas\n, and flood insurance is mandatory for most mortgage holders.\nLow or Moderate Flood Risk\nShaded X Zone: These properties are outside the high-risk zones. The risk is reduced but not removed.\nX Zone: These properties are in an area of lower risk.\nInsurance Note: Lower-cost preferred rate flood insurance policies (known as Preferred Risk Policies) are often an option in these areas.\nImportance of Floodplains\nFloodplains in our county serve a beneficial purpose to our quality of life. These low areas are where rainfall goes to drain. When the rainfall drains into the ground, it helps reduce flooding and recharges our drinking water supply. Some examples of floodplains in the county include the areas surrounding Gator Creek, Itchepackesassa Creek and Peace Creek.\nThese floodplains also serve as filters of stormwater runoff as it seeps through the ground and into our aquifer. The natural vegetation filters out impurities and uses excess nutrients. This aquifer is our only source of drinking water, and filtering helps contain pollution before it reaches our aquifer. It is important that we appreciate our floodplains, and try to maintain, preserve and restore these areas whenever possible.\nFloodplain land and adjacent waters combine to form a complex, dynamic physical and biological system found nowhere else. When portions of floodplains are reserved in (or restored to) their natural state, they provide many benefits to both human and natural systems. For example, by allowing floodwater to slow down, sediments settle out, thus maintaining water quality.\nThese benefits range from providing aesthetic pleasure to reducing the number and severity of floods, helping handle stormwater runoff and minimizing non-point water pollution.\nSuch natural processes cost far less money than it would take to build facilities to correct flood, stormwater, water quality and other community problems.\nTo learn more about your area,\nvisit the Southwest Florida Water Management District\nor the\nSouth Florida Water Management District\n.\nResources\nCity of Lakeland Flood Prevention\nFEMA\nFEMA FloodSmart\nFlood Insurance Rate Maps\n/.col\n/.row\nNortheast Government Center\n200 Government Center Boulevard\nLake Alfred, FL 33850\nPhone:\n(863) 534-4000\nBoard of County Commissioners\n330 W.

Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or entire community; or they can be very large, affecting an entire regional river basin or multiple states.\nAll floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, possibly over a period of days, while others can develop quickly and without any visible signs of rain.\nIt is important to be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live. But it is especially important to be aware if you live in low-lying areas or near water. Very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds or low-lying grounds that appear harmless in dry weather can flood.\nTo see the potential flooding sources in your area\nvisit FEMA Flood Map Service Center\n.\nFlood Basics\nMyth\nFact\nMy homeowner's policy will cover any flood damage.\nNot all homeowner's policies cover flood damage. Check your policy and/or with your insurance agent. Flood insurance can also be purchased from FEMA.\nIt has never flooded here, so it never will.\nFloods are caused by weather conditions and are unpredictable. Flooding can occur anywhere under the right conditions.\nThere was a flood problem, but it has been fixed.\nAlthough some flooding issues can be mitigated it is very difficult to fix a flooding problem.\nIf flooding was a problem, someone would have told us.\nCheck with Polk County Floodplain Management at (863)  534-6765 to find out if an area has flooded in the past or to determine if you are in a\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area.\nIt's only water. It's no big deal to be flooded.\nEven a few inches of water can bring thousands of dollars in repair and restoration costs.\nWe just had a 100-year flood, so my family will be safe from future flooding for the rest of their lives.\nThe 100-year flood has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. Statistically, there is more than a 1 in 4 chance of this type of flood occurring during a 30-year mortgage; however, they can occur much more frequently.\nDifferent Flood Zones\nFlood zones are land areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\nFEMA\n). Each flood zone describes that land area in terms of its risk of flooding. Everyone lives in a flood zone–it’s just a question of whether you live in a low, moderate or high-risk area.\nRisk Level Catagory\nFlood Hazard Zone\nHigh Flood Risk\nAE, A, AH or AO Zone. These properties have a one percent chance of flooding in any year and a 26 percent chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage.\nInsurance Note: High-risk areas are called\nSpecial Flood Hazard Areas\n, and flood insurance is mandatory for most mortgage holders.\nLow or Moderate Flood Risk\nShaded X Zone: These properties are outside the high-risk zones. The risk is reduced but not removed.\nX Zone: These properties are in an area of lower risk.\nInsurance Note: Lower-cost preferred rate flood insurance policies (known as Preferred Risk Policies) are often an option in these areas.\nImportance of Floodplains\nFloodplains in our county serve a beneficial purpose to our quality of life. These low areas are where rainfall goes to drain. When the rainfall drains into the ground, it helps reduce flooding and recharges our drinking water supply. Some examples of floodplains in the county include the areas surrounding Gator Creek, Itchepackesassa Creek and Peace Creek.\nThese floodplains also serve as filters of stormwater runoff as it seeps through the ground and into our aquifer. The natural vegetation filters out impurities and uses excess nutrients. This aquifer is our only source of drinking water, and filtering helps contain pollution before it reaches our aquifer. It is important that we appreciate our floodplains, and try to maintain, preserve and restore these areas whenever possible.\nFloodplain land and adjacent waters combine to form a complex, dynamic physical and biological system found nowhere else. When portions of floodplains are reserved in (or restored to) their natural state, they provide many benefits to both human and natural systems. For example, by allowing floodwater to slow down, sediments settle out, thus maintaining water quality.\nThese benefits range from providing aesthetic pleasure to reducing the number and severity of floods, helping handle stormwater runoff and minimizing non-point water pollution.\nSuch natural processes cost far less money than it would take to build facilities to correct flood, stormwater, water quality and other community problems.\nTo learn more about your area,\nvisit the Southwest Florida Water Management District\nor the\nSouth Florida Water Management District\n.\nResources\nCity of Lakeland Flood Prevention\nFEMA\nFEMA FloodSmart\nFlood Insurance Rate Maps\n/.col\n/.row\nAccordion Wrapper\nAccordion Header\nRelated Pages:\nAccordion Content\nAm I In a Flood Zone\nMitigating Future Impacts\nPreparation and Safety\nPrevention\nClick Here for Floodplain Management Contact Information\nPolk County Floodplain Management\nFor free flood assistance and inspections:\nPhone:\n(863) 534-6765\nor\n(863) 534-6767\nFloods are one of the most common hazards in the United States\n.

      "text": "About\nPolk County Then and Now\nEarly History of Polk County\nOn paper, Polk didn’t appear in historical records until just before the Civil War. However, its history far predates its 150-year-old name by about 11,000 years – to the last ice age. During that time, the sea levels were about 350 feet lower than they are today.\nIt’s largely thought the area’s first inhabitants were the\nPaleoindians\n, who had reached the northern parts of Florida about 10,000 B.C. The\nPaleoindians\nmade their way to the lower, interior areas of the state and along the\nGulf Coast\nand began making permanent settlements between 9,000 and 8,500 B.C., when the glaciers began to melt.\nEuropean explorers made their Florida entrance in the 1500s, followed by various Indian tribes. Many scholars associate the county’s Native American inhabitants with the\nTocobaga people of Tampa Bay\nand their close relatives,\nthe Mocosos\n, who lived east of the bay and along the Alafia and Hillsborough rivers.\nThe Seminole Indians\n, who were descendants of Georgia’s Creek Indians, didn’t settle the areas in and around Polk until the 1700s.\nPolk quickly underwent a period of growth and change during the 19th century.\nThe county’s first courthouse was constructed in 1867 in Bartow, on land donated by\ncattle baron Jacob Summerlin\n. By the 1880s, the development of various industries, including agriculture, citrus, cattle and phosphate, and the arrival of the railroad caused a boom in land prices.\nThe population of the county doubled as a new wave of visitors and workers settled in Polk.\nHenry Plant’s South Florida Railway\ncrossed the county and reached Tampa in 1884, linking central Florida with a massive transportation network. Locally produced goods were shipped by rail to national and international markets – Florida oranges could now reach major metropolitan areas like New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore in less than a week.\nPhosphate mining\nalso benefited from improvements in the transportation infrastructure and quickly became one of Polk County’s largest industries.\nCommunities sprang up across the area and a third courthouse was constructed in 1908, replacing the second built in 1884, to meet the growing needs for\nPolk County court services\n. By the 1920s, Florida had become a popular tourist destination and land prices soared, prompting a development boom in towns across the county.\nThe 10-story Polk Hotel\nopened in Haines City in 1926 and\nBok Tower Gardens\nin Lakes Wales was dedicated in 1929, an event attend by President Calvin Coolidge.\nAlthough the Florida boom ended with the onset of the Great Depression, the 1930s also brought the creation of Florida’s first theme park in Polk County,\nCypress Gardens\n, the opening of\nGeorge Jenkins’ first Publix grocery store\nin Winter Haven and the building of early airfields, which served the nation during World War II.\nCommunities sprang up across the area and a third courthouse was constructed in 1908, replacing the second built in 1884, to meet the growing needs for\nPolk County court services\n.

Citrus, cattle, agriculture and the phosphate industry still play vital roles in the local economy, along with an increase in tourism revenue in recent years. The county’s location between the Tampa and Orlando metropolitan areas has aided in the development and growth of the area. Residents and visitors alike are drawn to the unique character of the county’s numerous\nheritage sites\nand cultural venues, stunning natural landscapes, environmental lands and many outdoor activities, making Polk the crossroads of central Florida.

However, its history far predates its 150-year-old name by about 11,000 years – to the last ice age. During that time, the sea levels were about 350 feet lower than they are today.\nIt’s largely thought the area’s first inhabitants were the\nPaleoindians\n, who had reached the northern parts of Florida about 10,000 B.C. The\nPaleoindians\nmade their way to the lower, interior areas of the state and along the\nGulf Coast\nand began making permanent settlements between 9,000 and 8,500 B.C., when the glaciers began to melt.\nEuropean explorers made their Florida entrance in the 1500s, followed by various Indian tribes. Many scholars associate the county’s Native American inhabitants with the\nTocobaga people of Tampa Bay\nand their close relatives,\nthe Mocosos\n, who lived east of the bay and along the Alafia and Hillsborough rivers.\nThe Seminole Indians\n, who were descendants of Georgia’s Creek Indians, didn’t settle the areas in and around Polk until the 1700s.\nPolk quickly underwent a period of growth and change during the 19th century.\nThe county’s first courthouse was constructed in 1867 in Bartow, on land donated by\ncattle baron Jacob Summerlin\n. By the 1880s, the development of various industries, including agriculture, citrus, cattle and phosphate, and the arrival of the railroad caused a boom in land prices.\nThe population of the county doubled as a new wave of visitors and workers settled in Polk.\nHenry Plant’s South Florida Railway\ncrossed the county and reached Tampa in 1884, linking central Florida with a massive transportation network. Locally produced goods were shipped by rail to national and international markets – Florida oranges could now reach major metropolitan areas like New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore in less than a week.\nPhosphate mining\nalso benefited from improvements in the transportation infrastructure and quickly became one of Polk County’s largest industries.\nCommunities sprang up across the area and a third courthouse was constructed in 1908, replacing the second built in 1884, to meet the growing needs for\nPolk County court services\n. By the 1920s, Florida had become a popular tourist destination and land prices soared, prompting a development boom in towns across the county.\nThe 10-story Polk Hotel\nopened in Haines City in 1926 and\nBok Tower Gardens\nin Lakes Wales was dedicated in 1929, an event attend by President Calvin Coolidge.\nAlthough the Florida boom ended with the onset of the Great Depression, the 1930s also brought the creation of Florida’s first theme park in Polk County,\nCypress Gardens\n, the opening of\nGeorge Jenkins’ first Publix grocery store\nin Winter Haven and the building of early airfields, which served the nation during World War II.\nCommunities sprang up across the area and a third courthouse was constructed in 1908, replacing the second built in 1884, to meet the growing needs for\nPolk County court services\n.

Citrus, cattle, agriculture and the phosphate industry still play vital roles in the local economy, along with an increase in tourism revenue in recent years. The county’s location between the Tampa and Orlando metropolitan areas has aided in the development and growth of the area. Residents and visitors alike are drawn to the unique character of the county’s numerous\nheritage sites\nand cultural venues, stunning natural landscapes, environmental lands and many outdoor activities, making Polk the crossroads of central Florida.
