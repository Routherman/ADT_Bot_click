The Pixel 3 and Galaxy S8 phones are the oldest models used for testing.\nIf there’s a bug in an older device or OS version, we verify the issue exists in the current version of the app, then prioritize and resolve it.\nIf the issue doesn’t exist in the current version, depending on the severity of impact, it’s prioritized against the more recent issues.\nLimitations and alternatives\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the accessibility of Airbnb, there are some limitations. Below is a description of known limitations, and potential solutions. Please contact us if you observe an issue not listed below.\nKnown limitations for Airbnb:\nCustomer-uploaded images\nListing images, customer profile photos, and other uploaded images may not have descriptions. Hosts upload their own listing images and have the option to provide descriptions on desktop Web. Airbnb does not require it.\nWe are exploring options to automatically generate image descriptions for listing images. This solution could then be applied to other uploaded images.\nThird-party embeds\nContent that appears on Airbnb platforms via third-party vendors may not be accessible because these vendors don’t necessarily meet our standard of accessibility. Whenever a related accessibility issue is raised through our internal QA process, we contact the vendor about the issue and request that they fix it.\nNew vendor contracts include WCAG 2.1 Level AA support, but this does not apply retroactively to previous contracts.\nTablet testing\nAirbnb does not test our platform compatibility on tablets. This gap in testing might result in strange breakpoints and reduced user experience for tablet users.\nKeyboard and Braille display access on native mobile apps\nAirbnb does not test our platform compatibility with keyboard access on native mobile applications or Braille display. This gap in testing might result in a suboptimal experience for customers using these device combinations with our native applications.\nThere is currently no plan to include keyboard access or Braille display testing in our Quality Assurance process.\nAccessibility setting availability\nWeb customers can access accessibility settings after they’ve logged in. Native mobile application customers can access accessibility settings in both logged-in and logged-out states.\nAccessibility features\nWhile we know that accessibility is dynamic, here are some of the ways we have worked toward improving the accessibility of Airbnb.\nVisual\nScreen reader support\nColor contrast minimums\nResponsive web design\nFont magnification, dynamic type, adjustable font size\nAuditory\nOpen captions for video content\nImage descriptions for Airbnb-created content\nMobility\nKeyboard shortcuts on web\nMap zoom controls\nMap pan controls\nCognitive\nReduced motion settings\nPrevent video autoplay\nLoad more option (versus infinite scroll)\nSound off by default\nTo champion accessibility, we work with:\nWe’re here  to help\nVisit our\nHelp Center\nfor  more information.\nHow do I use search filters?\nIt’s easy to use our search filters to only show the listings that have the accessibility features you need.

These are then manually reviewed by a specialized team of Airbnb agents for photo accuracy and description quality, respectively.\nCan I bring my access provider or the person who supports me on an experience?\nHosts of experiences can choose to allow access providers to join the guests they’re assisting at no additional cost. On Airbnb, we consider access providers to be anyone over the age of 18 who regularly assists a person with a disability, mental illness, or a long-term illness with daily activities. Learn more about our\naccess providers and our related experiences policies\nfor guests and hosts.\nCan I bring my service animal with me?\nWe understand that service animals serve a crucial function for their owner.
