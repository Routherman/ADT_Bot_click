It was one of the first tourist retreats on the island and flourished from the 1930’s to the 1950’s. Thousands of visitors from all over the country came together to eat, drink, dance and fish from the Gulf Fishing Pier. Many events were hosted from this little location including fishing tournaments, beauty pageants, and boxing matches. It was even equipped with tennis courts, bath houses, a restaurant and bar. This beloved resort thrived until the late 1960’s, when it ultimately fell into disrepair and closed.\nAlthough we have lost the old building of The Casino Resort, we have not lost it’s spirit. Pensacola’s Casino Beach is still home to many attractions and Casino Beach Bar & Grille is the prime location for many of them including the Blue Angels Air Show, which brought in a over 10,000 people in 2014 alone, and the New Year’s Eve Fireworks display held at the end of the Pensacola Gulf Fishing Pier. As the Casino Beach culture continues to evolve, we evolve with it in hopes of giving both tourists and locals the best beach experience possible.\nBringing Back a Piece of History\nIn honor of Pensacola Beach’s proud and rich history, it just felt right bringing back the Casino Beach name. Casino Beach Bar & Grille is one of three different dining and entertainment concepts under the Culture Focused Brands umbrella founded by entrepreneurs, Scott Zepp and Matt LaFon. Zepp and Lafon are true natives to the Gulf Coast area and have always shared an appreciation for Pensacola Beach and the culture that has been created on their favorite little island. Their dream was to build the best beach hangout for locals and travelers alike to enjoy. After finding the perfect location, Casino Beach Bar & Grille was born in June 2014.\nFrom the beautiful panoramic views of the Gulf, to the warm and friendly smiles that greet every guest, Casino Beach Bar & Grille is all about customer experience. We offer signature island cocktails made from hand-squeezed fruit juices, quality coastal cuisine & delicious shareables. With our relaxed island vibe and unique location nestled at foot of the Pensacola Gulf Pier, Casino Beach Bar & Grille makes for the perfect beachfront hangout. Stop in and experience what it feels like to be on vacation everyday!\nLocated on Pensacola Beach, Florida, Casino Beach Bar & Grille features Caribbean-style dining, live entertainment, and spectacular views of the Gulf of Mexico.\nBusiness Info\n41 Fort Pickens Rd\nGulf Breeze, FL 32561\n850-932-6313\ninfo@casinobeachbar.com\nNon-Profit Charity Inquries\nHours\nMonday:\n11AM-10PM\nTuesday:\n11AM-10PM\nWednesday:\n11AM-10PM\nThursday:\n11AM-10PM\nFriday:\n11AM-11PM\nSaturday:\n11AM-11PM\nSunday:\n11AM-10PM\nKitchen Closed:\n10PM Daily\nHoliday Hours\nChristmas Day:\nClosed\nView this profile on Instagram\nCasino Beach Bar & Grille\n(@\ncasino.beach.bar\n) • Instagram photos and videos\nSister Companies\n©\nCasino Beach Bar and Grille.\nPowered by NETSIMPLE\nGoogle tag (gtag.js)\nGoogle tag (gtag.js) End\nGoogle Tag Manager\nEnd Google Tag Manager\nGoogle Tag Manager (noscript)\nEnd Google Tag Manager (noscript)",
