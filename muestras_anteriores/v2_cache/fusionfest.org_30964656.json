While there are dozens of festivals centered around one heritage or another in our community, we thought, What if we all came together at the same time?\nIn November of 2016, about 40 people from various heritages, including co-founder\nThali Sugisawa\n, gathered to brainstorm the best way to share our heritages. In the following month, a\nSteering Committee\nbegan to take shape and has been meeting monthly ever since.\nSome of the early stepping stones to the festival were bimonthly “Gathering of Nations” events with a few people from every heritage we could find in Central Florida (currently we have more than 140 heritages identified). Each of the Gatherings was focused on a particular aspect of culture – Food, Dance, Music, Clothing, Games, Literature. These explorations helped us envision what a “fusion” festival would look like – a place where we honored our heritages while celebrating how we influence each other as we shape our own unique identity as Central Floridians.\nAwards & Accolades\nAward of Excellence, 2019 Golden Brick Awards, Orlando Economic Partnership\nCommunity Outreach Program, 2020 SunSational Awards, Florida Festivals and Events Association\nBest Sponsor Partnership, Promotional Mailer and Instagram, 2021 SunSational Awards, Florida Festivals and Events Association\nArts, Culture and Historic Preservation, 2021 National Association of Counties (NACO) Achievement Awards\nArts Category Award, 2021 Golden Brick Awards, Orlando Economic Partnership\n1st Place - Community Outreach Program, 2024 SunSational Awards, Florida Festivals and Events Association\n2nd Place - Children's Programming, 2024 SunSational Awards, Florida Festivals and Events Association\n2nd Place- Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Initiative 2024 SunSational Awards by the Florida Festivals and Events Association\nMeet the Board of Directors\nMaria Fernanda Saavedra\nActing Executive Director    President, Board of Directors\nHuellas de Colombia Folkdances\nColombia\nIshaan Vadhera\nTreasurer\nValdela Co.\nShawn Welcome\nSecretary\nPolis Institute\nGuyana\nYves Bouele\nAfrican Leaders Council\nCameroon\nSamir Fyiki\nMoroccan American\nCultural Society\nMorocco\nKymbat Iglikova\nMultilingual International Services\nCentral Asia & Eastern Europe\nMeet The Team\nYear Round team\nThayna Romero\nBusiness Manager\nPuerto Rico\nGareth Edwards\nVisual Arts Curator\nAntigua\nSeasonal team\nJustine Francisco\nVolunteer Coordinator\nIdrees Kahn\nCulinary Contest Curator\nYessica Lizarraga\nWorld Dance Party Curator\nDr. Earl Mowatt\nGlobal Exchange Curator\nJae Nale\nMistress of Chaos &\nProduction Manager\nStacy Nale-Stadom\nFood, Merchandise, & Service Vendor Curator\nAmel Okoye\nVolunteer Coordinator\nLori Turchin\nMYgration Films Curator\nMeet the Steering Committee\nThe Steering Committee is responsible for helping shape and grow FusionFest by contributing with ideas and serving as an ambassador within their circle and community.
