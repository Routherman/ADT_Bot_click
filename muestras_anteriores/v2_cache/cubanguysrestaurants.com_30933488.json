When we first started out, our shared passion for bringing you Awesome Cuban Food, served Fast and by Friendly Folks drove us to unite forces and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into a booming Restaurant Chain. We now serve customers all over Miami-Dade County with four locations and are thrilled to bring our Cuban Flavors to the Fast-Casual industry spreading our Cuban love in the communities we serve. We hope you enjoy our Awesome Food and Friendly Service as much as we enjoy offering them to you.\nCUBAN GUYS RESTAURANTS\nFRITA CUBANA\nCuban Guys is an exciting fast-casual concept. We specialize in authentic traditional Hispanic sandwiches where the Tasty Cuban FRITA (Pronounced FREE-TAA) and the world famous Cuban Sandwich are the stars of the show. In addition to the delicious sandwiches, Cuban Guys offers traditional sides like Yucca Frita, Plantain Chips and Garden-Fresh Salads. Cuban Guys targets flavor aficionados who will appreciate the unique twists of Latin flavors and the hipper, more modern setting of our restaurants. Our menu is moderately priced and served with a smile to every guest every time !!!!\nFRESH : From our famous crispy string fries that are cut fresh and made in our restaurant everyday to our fresh never frozen ground beef that we hand make into FRITA patties every morning, we work hard to bring you the finest and freshest ingredients\nFLAVORFUL : Typical of the Cuban Cuisine our food is prepared using a variety of spices such as garlic, cumin, oregano and others that create recipes that result in an explosion of flavors\nFRIENDLY : We pride ourselves on hiring the friendliest staff!!! We measure our business success through our guests satisfaction and the only way we can achieve greatness is by hiring GREAT PEOPLE!!!\nTrademarks\nCuban Guys Restaurants Logos\nCuban Guys Restaurants\nYou don’t have to be cuban to love us!\nMENU\nAbout us\nContact Us\nOnline Order\nOur Locations\nSERVICES\nFood Truck Request\nCater With Us\nCareer\nCuban Guys Radio\nCOMPANY CONTACT\ninfo@cubanguys.net\n(786) 401-9426\n5979 NW 151 STREET\nSUITE 223\nMIAMI LAKES, FL 33014\n© 2025 Cuban Guys Restaurants.\nCookie policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & conditions\nConsent Management powered by Complianz | GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent https://wordpress.org/plugins/complianz-gdpr\nManage Cookie Consent\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.
