OMF was intended as a sanctuary, a place to escape the weight of everyday life. The natural paradise of Sunshine Grove – from the grassy meadowlands and secret forests to the expansive groves and picturesque lakes – became the ideal setting for our vision of a community connected through music, art, and unbridled joy.\nThis world first opened in 2016, and was brought to life over the years since by tens of thousands of beautiful souls. Each and every one of them travelled to experience the magical combination of nature and music, and enter a corner of the universe unlike any other. You can call it a ritual if you like, and you'd be right. But it's also a hell of a lot of fun.\nOMF's foundation is built on the pillars of community, creativity, spirituality, love, and respect. The OMF experience is one where we exist in harmony with each other and our surroundings, recognizing the profound influence and significance of the natural environment. It's a space where every Okeechobeeing can be their authentic self, cultivating kindness and respect both between each other and the environment we inhabit.\nStep through the portal, and enter the wonderful world of Okeechobee.\nOkeechobee Music & Arts Festival (OMF) takes place in the heart of the Florida countryside, on the picturesque private property\nSunshine Grove\n. A truly magical tropical landscape, with sweeping grasslands, pine and palmetto jungles, and expansive lakes and waterways, this slice of paradise in South Florida is not only breathtakingly beautiful but also ecologically significant.\nA sundown session at Sunshine Grove\nWe are deeply committed to the conservation and protection of this pristine environment. The festival grounds encompass diverse habitats, home to a variety of native flora and fauna, some of which are rare and endangered. As stewards of this land, we have implemented numerous sustainable practices to minimize our environmental footprint, including waste reduction initiatives, energy-efficient infrastructure, and habitat restoration projects. By attending our festival, you are supporting these vital conservation efforts and joining us in celebrating the harmony between music and nature.\nEarly morning in The Grove.\nAs you explore Sunshine Grove, you might catch a glimpse of majestic creatures grazing at the forest edge, hear the melodious songs of native birds, or see butterflies fluttering through wildflower meadows. We are proud to share this space with such incredible creatures, and are dedicated to protecting their habitats. Our conservation team works tirelessly to ensure that the festival has minimal impact, implementing measures such as designated wildlife corridors, noise control policies, and habitat preservation efforts. By participating in our festival, you are not only enjoying a weekend of incredible music, but also contributing to the ongoing protection and appreciation of the remarkable wildlife that calls this land home.\nSunshine Grove is a Soundslinger owned-and-operated venue located in Okeechobee County. It's less than a two and a half hour drive from South Florida's major cities, including Orlando, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Miami, and Fort Lauderdale.\nsunshinegroveflorida.com\nWhen we first started the Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival, the guiding principle and rule was just that simple.
