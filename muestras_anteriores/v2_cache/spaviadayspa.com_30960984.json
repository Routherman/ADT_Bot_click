Members enjoy special offers!\nLEARN MORE\nSection Twelve\nWhen the founders Allison and Marty Langenderfer created the Spavia brand, they wanted to create a name that reflected the products and services it offered and deliver results to help their guests relax, recenter, and renew.\nWhat’s in a name? Spavia- ‘via’ in many languages means route or pathway. Our interpretation of Spavia is the route or journey to wellness. Each of our guests have their own journey and at Spavia, it’s so important to create customized, result-driven treatments in a tranquil environment for our guests. It’s our guests’ journey and it begins at Spavia.\nIt is such a humbling experience to know that since 2005, that has been our focus and today with our growth and owners, brand partners and Spavia team members, we are making a difference. Thank you for entrusting Spavia on your journey to wellness and being our guest. We are so grateful.\nOUR STORY\nOn September 25, 2005, Spavia opened its doors with a mission and vision of making a positive difference in the world one guest at a time and delivering an exceptional experience our guests couldn’t live without. For us, it’s been about a journey, not a race to build a legacy and reputation of being the best, delivering the best and creating a Spavia culture that we are proud of each and every day. We are humbled and grateful for the opportunity to open our doors each day, create exceptional experiences and give back to our communities.\nToday, we are doing just that and our focus in creating the best experience with the best products and spa treatments is stronger than ever! Spavia is rapidly growing and with that comes great responsibility to ensure that we are offering the best to our guests, our teams, and our franchise owners. Thank you for being a part of the Spavia journey and welcome to the Spavia family!\nSection Thirteen\nSection Fourteen\nSection Fifteen\nOUR AWARDS\nSlideShow JS/CSS Files Placed Here (Important)\nLoad SlideShow JS/CSS files so they function through Shared Content.\nSlideShow Javascript file\nSlideShow CSS file\nSection Sixteen\nSection Seventeen\nSection Eighteen\nSection Nineteen\nSection Twenty\nSection Twenty-one\nSection Twenty-two\nSection Twenty-three\nSection Twenty-four\nSection Twenty-five\nSection Twenty-six\nSection Twenty-seven\nSection Twenty-eight\nSection Twenty-nine\nSection Thirty\nSection Thirty\nprivacy policy\n|\nterms & conditions\n© Spavia.

Monthly Membership Treatments are to be redeemed each month. Membership Treatments that are not used during their respective Membership Month can rollover (“Rollover Treatment”) and be used for 12 months after their respective Monthly Charge Date, as long as the member is an active member. Members are permitted to redeem one Rollover Treatment per Membership Month, in addition to the current month’s Membership Treatment.\nAppointments must be canceled at least 24 hours in advance, otherwise the appointment will be considered to have been used and an available Membership or Rollover Treatment will be redeemed. If a Membership Treatment is not available, members will be charged 50% of the regular price of the scheduled treatment.\nMemberships are non-transferable and non-refundable, however, in accordance with the rules of Spavia’s Family Share program, members may designate one family member or significant other to redeem monthly Membership Treatments or Rollover Treatments.\nThe minimum, non-cancellable, term of a membership is three (3) months. After the minimum term, memberships will be automatically renewed for successive one month periods, unless and until the membership is canceled.\nMemberships may be suspended for up to three months per calendar year. During suspension, membership benefits may not be used, including rollovers and special member savings or offers.\nMemberships may be canceled at any time with at least thirty (30) days written notice after the three month minimum term. Spavia reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of the Membership Wellness program upon advance prior written notice to its members and to cancel membership at any time. Upon cancellation of a membership, members will no longer be entitled to use the benefits of the Membership Wellness program, including redemption of unredeemed Membership Treatments, Rollover Treatments and discounted Gift Cards.\nSpavia retains the right to terminate membership at any time, for any reason.\nSection Four\nSection Five\nSpavia...what you need more often.
