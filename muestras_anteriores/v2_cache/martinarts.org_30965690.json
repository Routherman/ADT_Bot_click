MartinArts embraced the vision of a women's giving circle and has continued to provide support through its 501(c)3 umbrella and administrative services. In a community where the annual economic impact of the arts is more than 31 million, our grants fill an important gap.\nWSA makes modest grants to individual artists; students; local arts organizations, civic groups, and nonprofits; and occasional government agency programs. Grant amounts average about $1,400, and the range (to date) goes from a low of $150 to a high of $9,000.

They had the foresight to envision Martin County as a vibrant region where residents and visitors alike could enjoy an arts friendly community. Decades later these ideas have blossomed and MartinArts supports student and professional artists involved in the visual, performing, literary and culinary arts. We seek to inspire audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Housed in the historic Court House Cultural Center, MartinArts offers an array of in-person and virtual experiences, web-based resources, and off-site programs.\nThe future of MartinArts shines brightly. Those seeds planted years ago, have yielded a rich tapestry of arts organizations and venues to enjoy.

MartinArts embraced the vision of a women's giving circle and has continued to provide support through its 501(c)3 umbrella and administrative services. In a community where the annual economic impact of the arts is more than 31 million, our grants fill an important gap.\nWSA makes modest grants to individual artists; students; local arts organizations, civic groups, and nonprofits; and occasional government agency programs. Grant amounts average about $1,400, and the range (to date) goes from a low of $150 to a high of $9,000. All decisions about grants and allocations are made by group consensus.\nJoin Women Supporting the Arts\nLearn more about our Grant Process\nstart sidebar\nBEGIN nav\nDonate\nSponsorship\nMembership\nArtist Memberships\nPersonal Membership\nBusiness/Organizational Memberships\nThe Impressionists\nNARM Membership Benefits\nVolunteer\nSHS Arts Campus Project\nArt Out of the Closet\nWomen Supporting the Arts\nJoin Women Supporting the Arts\nGrants\nAbout Women Supporting the Arts Grants\nWSA Grant Application & Guidelines\nGallery\nEND nav\nunder-sidebar-container\nABOUT US\nWhat We Do\nStaff\nFrequently Asked Questions\nContact Us\nSUPPORT THE ARTS\nDonate\nSponsorship\nMembership\nArtist Memberships\nPersonal Membership\nBusiness/Organizational Memberships\nThe Impressionists\nNARM Membership Benefits\nVolunteer\nSHS Arts Campus Project\nArt Out of the Closet\nWomen Supporting the Arts\nJoin Women Supporting the Arts\nGrants\nAbout Women Supporting the Arts Grants\nWSA Grant Application & Guidelines\nGallery\nPROGRAMS & EVENTS\nArtsFest\nBe a part of ArtsFest!\nMartinArts Awards\nSupport the Awards!\nSunset Concerts at the Gallery\nHarvesting the Arts\nArts Education\nMarvin S.

The Martin Murals program is the vehicle that can inspire artists to design and paint murals on public and private properties throughout Martin County. The National Endowment for the Arts says it best “Creative placemaking animates public and private spaces, rejuvenates structures and streetscapes, improves local business viability and public safety, and brings diverse people together to celebrate, inspire, and be inspired.” Public art is also tied to positive tourism goals, instills a sense of civic pride, boosts economic growth, and inspires investment in our community.\nTo encourage public/private partnerships, the maximum funding amount through AIPP is $7,500 per project.\nQuestions?\nContact Martin County Art in Public Places Program  Office of Community Development 2401 SE Monterey Road Stuart, FL 34996 | (772) 419-6951\nSouth Florida Cultural Consortium Grant Program\nDeadline to Apply: October 6, 2025, 11:59PM\nMaximum Awards: $7,500 / $15,000\nThe South Florida Cultural Consortium Grant Program offers one of the largest regional, government-sponsored artists' grants in the United States, awarding $15,000 and $7,500 grants to resident visual and media artists from the counties of Broward, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach.
