      "text": "ABOUT US\nDEFINING AN ICON\nFrom colors to currency and bald eagles to baseball, life here in these United States is steeped in patriotic symbolism. Thanks to the courage and undying willpower of those who came before us, we’ve been granted freedom, the pursuit of happiness and the right to live in the greatest country in the world. On the global stage, America herself is the icon. And we believe that’s something worth toasting.\nFacebook Pixel Code\nEnd Facebook Pixel Code\nMEET THE CO-OWNER\nCarl Berry is a Florida native - born in Belle Glade and raised in Indiantown.  He has held almost every job in the hospitality industry, working his way up from his first job mopping floors at the age of 14, to line cook, Executive Chef, and General Manager.  In 2019, Berry left his position as Training Director of Duffy’s Sports Grill to join forces with Jason Emmett to acquire American Icon Brewery.  As the co-owner of the brewery, he runs the day-to-day operations and has expanded beer distribution to all parts of South Florida and the Treasure Coast. He says his formula for operating an exceptional craft beer brand and restaurant is simple, “Believe in your people, deliver great beer and great food, and have fun doing it.”\nMEET THE CO-OWNER\nJason Emmett has been in the restaurant industry his entire life, first as a child watching his father, who built a business in the industry, and then in a variety of rolls once joining the family business at Duffy’s Sports Grill.  Rising through the ranks, he ultimately took the reins of the business and served as the company President for several years.  In 2019, Jason stepped away from his role with Duffy’s to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors of his own, and together with Carl Berry, he acquired American Icon Brewery.  Jason also serves on the boards of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association and Discover the Palm Beaches.\nMEET THE BREWMASTER\nJesse Robles discovered his affinity for homebrewing while working at a craft beer store as a young adult. Soon thereafter, looking to expand his newfound craft, he enrolled at Siebel Institute of Technology and studied in Chicago, IL and Munich, Germany, where he earned an international diploma in brewing technology. Through his travels, Jesse developed an approach to brewing that is simple, principled and relies on the basics. The way he sees it, innovation in the world of craft beer is not about inventing new flavors, but rather, perfecting the classics and infusing them with a personal twist. Before joining American Icon Brewery, Jesse Robles worked as a brewmaster and cellar manager for other breweries in Florida and New York.\nMEET THE FOUNDER\nMichael Rechter is a real estate developer, investor, and entrepreneur who has built and managed a range of commercial properties and entertainment and hospitality businesses throughout Florida since 1998. With American Icon Brewery, Michael Rechter breathes new life into Vero Beach’s downtown historic district, which has seen a steady revival in recent years. During the redevelopment of the site, Michael intentionally preserved much of the original architectural features, which he felt were celebratory of iconic America and a perfect fit for the new gastropub. Prior to American Icon Brewery, Mr. Rechter rehabilitated other Vero Beach properties, including the Majestic Plaza and the adjacent Indian River Plaza on U.S. Highway 1, Vero Bowl, Stix Billiard Club, and many more. He splits his time between South Florida and Vero Beach with his wife and two beautiful daughters.\nABOUT US\nDEFINING AN ICON\nFrom colors to currency and bald eagles to baseball, life here in these United States is steeped in patriotic symbolism.
