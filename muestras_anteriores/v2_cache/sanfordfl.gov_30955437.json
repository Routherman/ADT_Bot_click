Over 26 square miles in size, with a population of over 59,000. The Sanford Fire Department operates 3 Stations with a total of 9 units consisting of 1 Battalion Chief, 3 Advanced Life Support Engines, A 100′ Aerial Platform, 3 Advanced Life Support Rescues,  and 1 Dive/Water Rescue Team with a 22′ Fire Boat.\nIn 2024, the Sanford Fire Department responded to 13,630 calls for services and provided 5,635 Emergency Medical transports to area hospitals.\nThe Sanford Fire Department announced that it has recently improved to an Insurance Service Organization (ISO) rating of 2.  The department is actively implementing practices to continue to improve this rating. This is a national classification system used by ISO to reflect a community’s local fire protection for property insurance rating purposes. The ISO has rated more than 47,000 fire departments nationwide and 725 in Florida. ISO classifies communities from 1 (the best) to 10 (the worst) based on how well they score on the ISO Fire Suppression Rating Schedule, which grades such features as water distribution, fire department equipment and manpower and fire alarm facilities. Communities with the lowest ISO ratings receive the most competitive property insurance rates.\nContact your Property Insurance Provider to see if you are eligible for reduced premiums due to our improved ISO rating.\nSanford Fire Department Headquarters\n1303 William Clark Avenue Sanford, Florida 32771\nAdministration:\n407.688.5040\nFax:\n407.688.5041\nView Map\nSanford Fire Prevention Division\n300 N.
