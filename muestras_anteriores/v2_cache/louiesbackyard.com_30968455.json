Having made his fortune, he ordered the construction of a gracious class revival home on Waddell Street - the building that is now known as Louie’s Backyard. Captain Adams was fond of boasting that everything in his home, with its unusual two-story side porch and Doric columns, was salvaged merchandise.\nThe house stayed in the Adams family for years. It then changed owners several times before it was bought by Frances and Louie Signorelli, who opened the first Louie’s Backyard in 1971 - a restaurant that seated twelve, had one lone waiter, and operated out of a cigar box register.\nThe restaurant, growing quickly, soon became famous for its fine food and relaxed oceanfront ambiance - and for Ten Speed, the legendary mutt that sauntered up to the outdoor bar most afternoons for his customary cocktail of Kahlua and Cream! Frequented by the likes of Jimmy Buffet and Tom McGuane, Louie’s Backyard received award after award for its superb cuisine.\nConstruction and renovation of the new Louie’s backyard began in January of 1983 and opened on December 27, 1983. The new owners, Phil Tenney and Pat Tenney, carried on the established tradition of dining excellence. The building has been lovingly renovated and enlarged with special attention paid to maintaining its historical integrity. In fact, in June of 1984, Louie’s Backyard earned a place in the National Register of Historic Places.\nToday, more than 41 years later, Phil and Pat’s son Jed Tenney is at the helm, steering Louie’s Backyard into the future with its long-standing traditions and excellence.\nLouie’s Backyard offers an oceanfront experience that is unlike any other. Our variety of dining options allows you to partake in either indoor or outdoor seating- to sit and enjoy the oceanic breeze or to watch as a local storm rolls through. Open dining and cocktail decks that lead down to the ocean gives the warm and heady ambience that is sought after when planning a trip to Key West.\nDiscover the perfect blend of Island cuisine and breathtaking waterfront views- where every meal feels like a getaway.\nWhat People Are Saying\n“Is one of South Florida’s best resturants…”\n— Lucy Cooper, The Miami Herald\n“Easily ranks among the best restaurants in the entire state…”\n— Robert Tolf, Ft.
