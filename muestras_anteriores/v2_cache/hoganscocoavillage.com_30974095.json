Our pub is not just a place to enjoy food and drink—it's an authentic Irish experience steeped in history and hospitality. Many of the furnishings and antiques that adorn our space made the journey across the Atlantic from Ireland in 2012, bringing with them the spirit and charm of the Emerald Isle.\nOriginally opened in Cape Canaveral in 2012, Hogan's Irish Bar quickly became a beloved local spot. We were thrilled to reopen in Cocoa Village in May 2022, allowing us to once again share our family’s heritage with the community. Owned and operated by the Hogan Family from County Mayo, Ireland, we take pride in offering more than just Irish pub fare. Here, you’ll find a carefully curated selection of imported stouts and ales, fine Irish whiskeys, and a welcoming atmosphere that makes every visit memorable.\nWe invite you to join us at Hogan's Irish Pub, where the warmth of Irish hospitality awaits. Whether you're here for a pint, a meal, or simply to soak in the ambiance, we look forward to raising a glass with you.
