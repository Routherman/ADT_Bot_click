At Francis Lake, everyone is always welcome.\nFather and Son Duo – Jon Sr. and JR\nThe Leonard Family (L-R) – Pate, Allison, JR, Mary, and Trey\nJon Sr. and Kay Leonard\nOur Course\nThe 18-hole Francis Lake Golf Club in Lake Park, Georgia is a semi-private golf course that opened in 1971. Designed by Willard Byrd, Francis Lake Golf Club measures 6602 yards from the longest tees and has a slope rating of 131 and a 71.8 USGA rating.\nThe course features 6 sets of tees for different skill levels.\nFrancis Lake is proudly owned and operated by PGA golf professionals.\nThe FLGC Team (L-R) – Ryan Parker, Kay Leonard, Allison Leonard, and JR Leonard\nThe FLGC Team:\nJon H. “J.R.” Leonard, Jr.\n| Co-Owner, Head PGA Golf Professional, Greens Superintendent\nAllison Leonard\n| Co-Owner\nKay Leonard\n| Co-Owner\nRyan Parker\n| Assistant PGA Golf Professional\nRick Ratliff, Tony DePesa + Pate Leonard\n| Pro Shop Attendants\nMaria McKay-Conkin, Albree Shiver, Morgan Sutherland + Abby Stewart\n| Snack Bar Attendants\nWayne Carter, Dustin Doscher + Spenser Sutherland\n| Grounds Crew\nGavin Tomlinson, Brooks Hamm + Jake Bennett\n| Cart Movers\nAbby Stewart\n| Beverage Cart Attendant\nWe’d love to see you!\n5366 Golf Drive\nLake Park, GA 31636\nBook a tee time!\nGallery Reel\nOur Roots\nAt Francis Lake Golf Club, we know a thing or two about humble beginnings, and a whole lot about family. What was once a simple family farm grew from a 9-hole golf course in the mid-1960’s to the beautiful 18-hole club that so many call home today.\nThough we are proud of our lush golf course with scenic views, we are even prouder of the true community that has sprung up around it. Look around, and you will see a family that has grown strong roots over the past 49 years.\nSince 1997, Francis Lake has been owned and operated by the Leonard family. With a long history of PGA professionals in the family, it only made sense that father and son pair, Jon and JR Leonard, would join forces to cultivate a strong golf community–alongside their own families, too. Today, JR and his wife Allison are proud to honor Jon Sr.’s legacy and passion for the game of golf, and the incomparable community that exists because of it, at Francis Lake.\nWe hope you’ll see that southern hospitality takes on a new meaning at Francis Lake, from our community outreach and support to our philanthropic efforts and everything in between.\nSo pull up your golf cart, grab an iced cold Coca-Cola or beer from the Snack Bar, and don’t be a stranger!
