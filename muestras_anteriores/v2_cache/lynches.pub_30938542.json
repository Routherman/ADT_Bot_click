After 17 successful years on the island, the sisters decided to bring the spirit of Ireland to St. Armands Circle.\nLynches Pub & Grub opened in February 2003.  We are one of a few authentic Irish Pubs. Even our stone floor came from West Cork Ireland.\nIn March 2015, Jason Burns purchased Lynches Pub & Grub from the Lynch sisters. Jason has brought back several items from his many trips to Ireland. Some of his favorites are the 75+ year old road signs, and a license plate from every county in the Republic of Ireland.\nOf course, Jason had to visit a few pubs along the way. As you know, it’s difficult to walk by an Irish pub without stopping in.\nCopyright © 2023 Lynches Pub & Grub - All Rights Reserved.",
