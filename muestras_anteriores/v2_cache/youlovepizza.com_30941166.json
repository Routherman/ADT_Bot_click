Her first foray into the Mount Dora restaurant scene was with a venture she founded called 5th Avenue Café; a trendy, upscale restaurant featuring organic and clean cuisine. 5th Avenue Cafe had a great six year run and during that time, Jesse Thomas, a native of Mount Dora, Florida teamed up with Leigh and became the restaurant’s Executive Chef.\nWhile in the 5th Avenue Café kitchen, Chef Jesse regularly baked bread for service to our guests. Each time he did, he created personal pizzas exclusively for the restaurant staff. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed them as they were crispy, delicious and the best around town!\nWith this newly discovered talent and product, Leigh and Jesse went to work creating and establishing a new endeavor named “PizzAmoré”. It was with a touch of sadness as they closed 5th Avenue Café, but with great joy as PizzAmoré was born and it was then that Leigh and Jesse became business partners in this establishment.\nOur objective was to create a warm, inviting, fun and casual place to bring the entire family. Since PizzAmoré was born during the height of the recession, it was important to them to create a space where our guests would enjoy great tasting food in a comfortable setting, all at a great price, and provided by friendly and knowledgeable staff.\nOur business goal is singular in nature and very simple. Our people, our guests and our community all play a vital role in our success and we will always treat each one with the respect and gratitude they richly deserve.\nWe know that there are a multitude of places where you can choose to dine. So when you come to PizzAmoré, we want your dining experience to be one you want to repeat and do so often!\nSo if there is ever a time that your experience is not completely right for you; let us know! We guarantee that we will make it right and to your satisfaction!\nAnd that’s our promise that we make to you, our guest.\nLeigh Love moved to Mount Dora over a decade ago and wanted to share her passion for great food and wine.
