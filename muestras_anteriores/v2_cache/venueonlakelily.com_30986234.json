Through his championing the community with various causes, i.e., negotiations with the initial developers of Maitland Center to protect the community’s interests and holding City Leaders through the years accountable to their commitments to us, the community. In addition, he loved the arts and supported other community non-profits such as Performing Arts Matter, Art and History Museums Maitland, and the Maitland Library. When Len joined the Venue’s Board, he continued to champion our community’s multiple interests and, most importantly, help save the Venue during an unforeseen pandemic through his business acumen.\nLen was a warrior, and his passing left a great void in many lives. However, he will never be replaced. Instead, Len’s past presence will only inspire new volunteers to our community’s causes.\nRest in peace, our dearest friend. You are missed!\nThe Board of Directors, Officers, and Staff, Venue on Lake Lily – The Maitland Civic Center\nLEONARD SCHMIDT MEMORIAL FUND\nIn lieu of flowers Len’s family has designated his favorite charity, the Maitland Civic Center, for memorial contributions.\nThe Maitland Civic Center is now accepting donations in memory of Len Schmidt.
