However, in 1944, our organization returned when a group of community visionaries officially signed articles of incorporation, re-branding under president Frank Poffenbaugh as the\nKissimmee Valley Livestock Show and Fair Association\n. Twenty founding members supported an organization dedicated to educational development, commerce, industry, and agriculture in the Osceola County and Kissimmee Valley areas.  These principals have been facilitated throughout the years in the form of fairs, livestock shows, and local purebred livestock sales. KVLS was established on the belief of the importance of youth development, and has realized such through involvement with 4-H and Future Farmers of America organizations. We, at the Kissimmee Valley Livestock Show and Fair Association, have always had a strong commitment to the vision of our founders and will continue to through dedication to our members, facilities, and volunteers.\nof\nTranscript\nToday\nToday, The Kissimmee Valley Livestock Show has more than 200 supporting members who continue to dedicate themselves to the mission of our founders.  Throughout the year, members work together to plan and coordinate the Oscecola County Fair, our annual 10 day event held each February. Their commitment to the fair, along with additional agriculture shows and educational events, maintains the KVLS Show Pavilion. Because of its members, this outstanding facility is host to shows and events such as the Osceola County Extension Master Gardeners’ Semi-Annual Plant Sale, the University of Florida Small Farms Conference, and the Junior Florida Cattlemen’s Association Beef Show, along with various meetings, parties, and weddings throughout the year.\nof\nTranscript\nWhat We Do\nThe work of a KVLS member is never done! Committee Chairmen and their teams constantly search for new and exciting opportunities for Osceola County youth who find themselves interested in agriculture, one of our nation’s top industries, while simultaneously acknowledging the value of top entertainment at an affordable price to Central Florida Families. Members, along side a guiding Board of Directors, attend workshops, educational seminars, and trade shows in order to ensure we always have the best tools for the job.  Our members generously give back to their community, volunteering hours of time, seeking sponsorship, fundraising for scholarship programs, and supporting numerous youth and community programs in a variety of capacities.\nof\nTranscript\nHow to become a Member??\nMembership in this organization is open to any resident of Osceola County, Florida, who is a qualified elector of Osceola County and who is interested in the objectives of the organization.
