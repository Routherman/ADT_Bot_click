They came up with the idea of a women’s club. Organized it, formulated some ideas for it and launched it.\nFamily of muralist Bernard P.

We are proud to be part of these organizations.\nThe Boynton Woman’s Club building is located at 1010 South Federal Highway. It was designed by famed architect, Addison Mizner, and was built 1925-1926 for $50,000. The cornerstone was laid in 1932 and the building and property were dedicated to Major Nathan Smith Boynton, whose heirs contributed $35,000 toward this lasting memorial to him. Shortly after the building was completed area residents sought shelter from a hurricane within its walls. Many of the local community organizations and churches held their first meetings in this building.\nDuring World War II the Red Cross and the USO used the building as a center. It housed the community’s library until 1961, and continues to serve as a social and cultural center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Mizner Foundation was instrumental in repairing the building in time for the Diamond Jubilee in 1986. Members of the club and the community continue to focus on maintaining this historical and beautiful building\nA mural depicting the history of Boynton Beach, painted by noted muralist, Bernard P. Thomas (1918-1994), for the Boynton Woman’s Club is hung in the dining room. Mr. Thomas also conducted art classes at the clubhouse.\nHis students painted the background scenery for the ballroom stage. Mr. Thomas also conducted art classes at the clubhouse and his students painted the background scenery for the ballroom stage. Some of his other\nwork can be seen at the Dahl Art Center.
