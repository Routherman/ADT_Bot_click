She graduated from Titusville High School and The University of Central Florida. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in Elementary Education. She has been a teacher, teacher’s assistant, and reading tutor in Brevard County for 31 years! Kindergarten holds a special place in her heart, and she is so excited to join the IRCCA team as the new kindergarten teacher.\nLori and her husband, Frank, have been married for 30 years. They have 2 beautiful daughters, Rebekah and Aleah, and a little dog named Theo. She loves teaching children to read and write, but her greatest joy is teaching them the love and hope of Jesus Christ.\nMrs. Neva Murray\nFirst Grade\nI am very excited to be a part of IRCCA.  I believe God has lead me to teach first grade this year.  I have three years of first grade teaching experience as well as twenty seven years of teaching in Christian and public schools.  Most recently, I worked at The Kids’ Place implementing the Pyramid Model, which is a social emotional program to promote character and social skills in young children.\nMy husband, Steve and I have been married thirty-five years and we have raised three children. We love spending time with family, especially our two grandsons who live nearby.  We love to camp, hike, play in waterfalls and experience nature.  We attend and are involved at Gateway Community Church.  My life verse is Proverbs 3:5-6 “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not unto your own understanding.  In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path.”\nMrs. Michele Dembowski\nSecond Grade\nMichele and her husband grew up in Wisconsin and moved to Titusville, Florida in 1996. She has three, children, (Jaime, Kris, & Jennifer) and three adorable grandchildren (Braden, Olivia, & Michaela) which are all her pride and joy. Michele has taught and worked with children all of her adult life. She has a Bachelor of Science Degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and is certified to teach Prekindergarten/Primary Education Ages 3 through Grade 3. She also has her Professional Endorsement for ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages). Her experiences include being the Lead VPK teacher for 6 years (Certified in Emergent Literacy), 9 years teaching kindergarten, and 3 years teaching second grade.\nMichele has always been a strong believer in God. When the opportunity arose to join the IRC family, she knew that this is where she needed to be. She is very excited to be our second grade teacher and grow in faith with her new students. She found this quote: “Just think, you’re not here by chance, but by God’s choosing to fulfill His special purpose for this generation.” She believes she can make a positive and long lasting impact on her students, her school, and her community.\nMrs. Kimberly Campbell\nThird Grade\nKimberly grew up in Geneva, Florida, and moved to Titusville shortly before having her first daughter in 2020. Before obtaining a Bachelor of Science Degree in Secondary Education (ELA), she was a Certified Dental Assistant. After becoming a mother herself, she knew she wanted to make a positive impact on local youth and did so by teaching at Jackson Middle for two school years.\nKimberly enjoys spending time boating and swimming with her husband and daughters, and watching football games while her husband coaches for Astronaut High. She regularly attends Sunday service at The Grove Church, and both of her daughters can be found sharing their love of Christ here at IRCCA and TKP!\nBianca Lowe\nActivity Teacher\nAfter spending 15 years overseas in Okinawa, Japan, I relocated back to Florida in 2012 and began working in the public school system.  After moving to Titusville in 2017, I joined The Kids’ Place, where I spent several summers working with children of all ages. In 2022, I accepted the position of Assistant Director of the School Age Program. This year, I was thrilled to take on a new opportunity with IRCCA, teaching activity classes and continuing my passion for working with children.\nI’m married and have two wonderful sons — William, a senior at Titusville High School, and Zachary, a fourth grader at Imperial Estates Elementary. In my free time, I am currently enrolled in school and look forward to finishing my degree next year. I also enjoy spending time in my pool and attending many of Zachary’s football and baseball games with my family.\nAdministration\nHeather Quidort\nPrincipal\nCindy Richardson\nAssistant Principal/Finance\nTeachers\nMrs. Lori Barber\nKindergarten\nLori was born and raised in Cocoa, Florida.
