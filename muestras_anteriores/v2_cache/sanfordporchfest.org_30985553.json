Sanford Porchfest is a FREE grassroots festival that takes place on the fourth Saturday of every February in the historic residential downtown of Sanford, FL. It is the ultimate sense of community - where every attendee, homeowner, artist and organizer plays a part in the overall experience.\n​\nSet up within walkable distances, several homes will host a diverse mix of bands/artists performing simultaneously as neighbors and friends gather under the oak trees, porches become center stage and concert lawn takes on a new meaning.\n​\nSanford Porchfest is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that unifies its community through music with the mission of enhancing access to and promoting the arts through educational scholarships. Built entirely on goodwill; from the organizers, artists, and homeowners - all of the proceeds from the festival (collected through donations, sponsorships, and merchandise sales) are returned to the community in the form of funding performing art programming for youth and awarding fine-art scholarships through various beneficiaries.\n​\nThe vision of Sanford Porchfest is to be an authentic and altruistic organization that helps unify the Sanford community through access to music, access to arts education, and access to each other.
