For shareholders, the monthly maintenance fee is $192.5. For those who lease, the monthly maintenance fees range from $438 to $513 per month, with most paying on the lower end. These fees include use of the clubhouse, a heated swimming pool, shuffleboard courts, lawn mowing and edging, trash removal and sewer, high speed internet and TV.\nThere is a pool table in the clubhouse. The community has paved streets and sidewalks, with ample lighting.\nAll homes are double-wide units which have a covered carport, cement driveway and an in-ground sprinkler system.\nThere is a listing of homes currently for sale.
