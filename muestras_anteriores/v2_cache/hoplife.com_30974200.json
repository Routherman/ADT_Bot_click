In 2012 Robert Tearle joined the company and in 2016 Jeffrey Blitman partnered with us.\n​\nAs home brewers, we take pride in embracing the art of the brewing culture. Our commitment is to use only the finest ingredients for our specialty- made hand crafted beer. Hop Life Brewing Company is more than a craft brewing company, it’s a way of life. Jim and Rob are both aware of the importance of values, passion, and dedicated teamwork due to their successful careers in the fire service. Jim is a 33-year veteran firefighter and recently retired Battalion Chief with the Saint Lucie County Fire District.\n​\nJim has owned and operated two previous businesses, a landscaping business and Blue Water Pool service. Rob is a 28-year veteran firefighter, and currently works with the Air Rescue Program on the Saint Lucie County Fire District. Jeffrey Blitman founded a packaging manufacturing company in 1987 which was sold and for almost 20 years owned a golf car distribution company in Broward County. In aspiring to move toward the next phase in our lives, we’ve moved on to create, manufacture, and distribute some of the finest craft beer produced in the State of Florida. We work with a state-of-the-art brewing system, in a facility where people can come to relax, enjoy, and even learn about the fine art of brewing great beer. The focal point of the brewery is a 15-barrel stainless steel brew house, several fermenters and brite tanks, along with the brewing process itself.\n​\nThe 2000+ square foot Brew House is separated by a large glass window from the Taproom.\nHop Life Brewing Company\noffers not only a great place to enjoy Artisan Crafted beers, but beers that cannot be found in other breweries. Its goal is to be a gathering place for all beer lovers, from the connoisseur to the curious. This passion for brewing great beer drives us to work hard in creating products that not only sit well on the palette but allow our patrons to enjoy new and innovate craft beers.\nClick\nhere\nto watch some clips of our canning process!\nVisit\nHop Life\nBrewing Company\nBrewery & Taproom:\n679 NW Enterprise Drive, Suite 101\nPort St Lucie, FL 34986\nPhone: (772) 249-5055\nContact Hop Life Brewery\nHours of Operation:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday - Thursday: Noon-10pm\nFriday - Saturday: Noon-12am\nSunday: Noon-8pm\nPrivate Events:\nBeer Garden Rental\nLive Music Options\nCatering Options (\nMenu\n)\n(Reservation Required 2 weeks in advance)\nBrewery Tours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday - Friday: 10am-4pm\nIndividual or Groups up to 10\n(Reservation Required 48 hours in advance)\n\nHome\nAbout\nOur Beer\nScratch Kitchen\nEvents\n\nQuick Nav\nMerch\nMug Club\nGift Cards\nContact Us\nName\nEmail Address\nMessage\n6 + 7\n=\nSubmit\n© 2025 Hop Life Brewing Company – All Rights Reserved.\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow",
