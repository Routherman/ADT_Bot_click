      "text": "Our Special History.\nOur renowned Tavern and Listening room, located in the heart of St. Augustine, remains a favorite for live music, drinks and delicious homemade food for local residents and visitors alike. Our comfortable laid-back atmosphere is reminiscent of its centuries old Saint Augustine history.\nOriginally built as a gristmill in the 1880’s, the Milltop was transformed into a bar in the 1950’s.  After 20 years of successfully serving a growing, loyal customer base, the owners saw the potential to offer their clients a broader experience.  Renamed the Milltop Tavern and Listening Room, they rebuilt and expanded the unique tree house interior, serving up live music and great food at our picturesque St. George Street location.\nIn 2016, the tavern’s building and site, which was granted historic landmark status, required a complete renovation.  During preconstruction work, the City of Saint Augustine unearthed and preserved a wealth of artifacts including a long-forgotten water well and a two-foot diameter gopher tortoise shell!  During construction, we reinstalled the 300-year-old Pecky Cypress wood panels found in the original Milltop to recreate its former warmth and the striking acoustics that they uniquely provide. By adding a full service kitchen, a full bar, and an outdoor balcony overlooking Saint George Street, the new Milltop was born.\nCome and visit us and enjoy all we have to offer.
