We’re excited to offer you great times with good friends, wine, beer, trivia, bingo, and of course great food! We look forward to becoming your neighborhood “Cheers,” can’t wait to get to know you all by name!\nWe moved to Florida 3 years ago, but were both born and raised in Ohio. We met and spent many years in the Columbus area. We moved to Charlotte in 2016, and then to Florida in 2021.\nWe have a total of four beautiful children, two 26-year-old twins, Michael and Katie, and two 8-year-old twin girls, Reagan and Cayleigh. Last, but definitely not least, we have our handsome Great Dane, Murphy.\nI [Kevin] spent most of my career in the field of IT Consulting. I enjoy coaching youth sports and community involvement. Shauna works in the oncology field as a radiation therapist. She enjoys dining out, socializing with friends and family, and relaxing with a good book.\nWe find Punta Gorda to be the perfect quaint little town with everything we need to raise our 8-year-old twin daughters. Our family enjoys the social atmosphere of Fishermans Village, the festivals and farmers markets, and a personal favorite — sampling all of the delightful food provided by Punta Gorda’s many local restaurants.\nIn our short time here in Punta Gorda Isles, we’ve been extended immense kindness. Our passion for wine, beers, and small plates compliment our personalities for fun, food, and building lasting relationships.\nWe’re ready to bring on the flatbreads, flowing wine, and fun!
