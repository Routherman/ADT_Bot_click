Artists and artisans showcase a wide variety of works and mediums inside of Tom Varn Park– a natural setting surrounded by beautiful oak trees in Brooksville, Florida.

It was a logical next step when a forward-thinking Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) created the\nHernando County Fine Arts Council\nin 1987 under the authority of the Florida Statutes.\nNow the Arts Council has a working board with 15 active members that serve 4-year terms. We work year-round to put on the largest art show in Hernando County and use the funds raised to offer two grant programs to our community and encourage, promote, and support the arts in Hernando County with resources and programs for all.\nLearn more\nMore about the\nHernando County Fine Arts Council\nOur mission is to\nencourage, promote, and support\nall the creative arts in Hernando County and to provide a means to showcase the arts.\nThrough advocacy, engagement, education, and art-inspired programs and events, we work to fulfill this mission.
