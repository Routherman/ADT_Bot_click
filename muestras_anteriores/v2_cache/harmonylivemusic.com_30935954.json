She had a 27-year career in advertising, marketing and promotional writing in South Florida before moving to Stuart, where she owned and operated NOTES MUSIC ROOM for 3 years -- but Covid ended the magic and she started spending time in Fort Pierce. She moved here, and was thrilled and DELIGHTED to bring that same special vibe, positive atmosphere and \"musical family\" to the Fort! She operated HARMONY MUSIC LOUNGE in Downtown Ft. Pierce for 3 years, and it was beloved by many! But ultimately, it was difficult to pay the rent off-season, and she was denied a lease renewal. Ever the optimist, she believes all is meant to be, and that new adventures and a new purpose await. She seeks to not only help and support musicians and artists of all kinds with her endeavors, but to also make sure that her works aid the homeless and mentally ill.\n​\n\"\nMUSIC\nis my heart. My soul. My energy, my solace, my joy, my passion, my greatest love. All genres, all styles, I appreciate and embrace it all -- and the people who make it. I want to devote my time, energy, resources, and life to: --Bringing all sorts of music to people and giving them a special, wonderful musical experience; --Meeting, encouraging, supporting, energizing, nurturing, exposing and promoting new talent and youth as well as older, highly experienced musicians that only gig occasionally and have difficulty finding venues. And  --Concepting, creating and executing unique music-themed\nspecial events\n. And honestly, as much as I hated to give up Harmony Music Lounge, it was a TRULY AMAZING time period and experience in my life--- It had an energy and a way of being that doesn't exist elsewhere. I am proud of what I accomplished at HARMONY Lounge, with the help of my right-hand man and sound engineer, David Donovan. Now, I'm committed to HARMONY MUSIC EVENTS, untilziing other venues.
