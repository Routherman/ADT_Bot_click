      "text": "About us\nOkeechobee Shooting Sports\nis the greatest of its kind in south Florida – the ultimate shooting and gunsmithing destination featuring outdoor rifle and pistol ranges, 5 different Five-Stand fields, Trap, Skeet, and Steel Galleries.\nIt all began with a dream to build a shooting facility where shooters of all disciplines could enjoy the ultimate experience. A place that offered shooting sports, gunsmithing, instruction, firearms and shooting accessories, practice, and competition. And a place where shooters could have a great time with and get to know other people in the shooting community.\nIn 2009, the dream became a reality with the opening of\nOkeechobee Shooting Sports\n. The outdoor shooting facility welcomed a top-notch staff and range officers. We offer various shooting ranges including clays, pistol and long range rifle. We also have full service gunsmithing on premises, a Pro Shop, instruction, competitions, and much more. Today, hundreds of shooters enjoy this great place for shooting on a weekly basis. Guests utilize the wide selection of ranges that accommodate different shooting disciplines and activities designed with both the beginner and the long time shooter in mind. The environment is safe, family-oriented and equipped with all your shooting needs. It’s nearly 100 acres of shooting paradise. There’s great food available on-site, so there’s no need to bring your own.\nCome on out and experience the greatest outdoor shooting facility in south Florida.\nLocated in beautiful Okeechobee County which is known for its many outdoor sports related activities. For those who enjoy an overnight stay, there is a campground on our property that hosts dry tent sites as well as RV sites with water and electric. All to make your time with us even better, including accessibility for all guests. It’s a short- but beautiful Florida country drive from many large airports and vacation destinations.\nTake a look at some of our\nRanges\nand\nClays\ncourses!\n(863) 357-3006\n7055 NE 48th St\nOkeechobee, FL 34972",
