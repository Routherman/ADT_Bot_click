The building was designed by Alan J. McDonough, the architect of Eustis City Hall, the Alice McClelland Memorial Bandshell, the Daytona Beach Bandshell, and the Lake County Courthouse, among many others.\nAt the time, the population of Eustis was less than 1,200, and the theatre sat 518 patrons in its auditorium, including balcony, which is now used for lighting and sound equipment. The building originally served as both a vaudeville theatre and a venue for the latest craze in entertainment: moving pictures. It had one of the largest photo play pipe organs in the southeast. As vaudeville faded into the past, the theatre was used solely for movies; sound was installed in late 1929. The State Theatre was a popular place to see movies through the 1960s, however the auditorium was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair.\nIn 1974, a small group of theatre lovers rediscovered the vacant State Theatre building. With visions of bringing live performances back to Eustis, they moved in and began the arduous task of restoring the building to its former glory. The founding members of the Bay Street Players cleared the theatre of debris and, in July 1975, opened their inaugural production,\nHello Dolly!\n, to great fanfare. The following season, they mounted eight productions and have been continuously serving the community ever since. In 1976, Bay Street Players produced the first of its annual Dolly Awards ceremony, so-named to honor the cast and crew of their debut production.\nIn January 1976, founding member Deborah J. Carpenter (d. 2017) started one of the first youth theatre education programs in the state, the Young People’s Theatre, with eighteen students performing\nThe Wizard of Oz\n. Over the following years, enrollment continued to grow, and the Young People’s Theatre program is now among the longest continually running youth theatre education initiatives in the nation.\nNow in its 50th anniversary season, Bay Street Players continues to entertain audiences from across Florida to the State Theatre, with a reputation for quality live performances. Whether you are a longtime patron or a new member of our community, Bay Street Players looks forward to welcoming to the State Theatre for many years to come!",
