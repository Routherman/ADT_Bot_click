      "text": "about\nfck\nBack in 1978, a small sports bar opened its doors on South Dale Mabry Highway with a simple mission: give Tampa a place where fans could feel at home — where the beer was cold, the food was solid, and the game was always on. That place was Walters Press Box Sports Emporium, and over 40 years later, it’s become more than just a bar. It’s a local legend.\nWhat started as a humble hangout has grown into a true Tampa staple. We’ve welcomed generations of fans through our doors — all coming together for the love of the game, or just the love of being around good people. If there’s a game on, you can bet it’s playing at The Press Box.\nWe've seen friendships form over pool tables, rivals buy each other rounds after a tough loss, and regulars become part of the team. You can catch a game of Golden Tee or darts between quarters, pick your perfect playlist on TouchTunes, or kick back with a cold one on our outdoor patio — complete with screens so you don’t miss a minute of the action. And if you're looking around between plays, you'll spot signed memorabilia from Tampa sports legends covering our walls — a tribute to the teams and athletes that made this city proud.\nThrough it all, we’ve kept that same neighborhood spirit — honest food, strong drinks, and a front-row seat to every game that matters. We were one of the first in Tampa to toss crispy chicken wings in classic Buffalo sauce — back when it was still a Northeast thing. We brought that heat down south and made it our own. Now? It’s a game day staple, and we still do it right.\nWith 42 screens spread throughout the restaurant, a matrix wall, and an electric sporting atmosphere, The Press Box is still the place where Tampa comes to eat, drink, and cheer. Whether you're a regular who knows your server’s name or a first-timer popping in for our famous chicken wings and the game, you’re part of the Press Box family the moment you walk in\nThanks for making us your home turf since ’78.\nWe’ll save you a seat.\nabout\nfck\nBack in 1978, a small sports bar opened its doors on South Dale Mabry Highway with a simple mission: give Tampa a place where fans could feel at home — where the beer was cold, the food was solid, and the game was always on.
