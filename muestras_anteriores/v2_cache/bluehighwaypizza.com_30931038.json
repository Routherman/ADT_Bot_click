Famous for antiques and as the location for the film Doc Hollywood, the small unbelievably picturesque town is home to the original “Highway to Pizza Heaven.” The ambiance is fun, funky, and casual, reminding you that driving down the blue highways of small town USA can bring unexpected treasures.\nTioga\nBlue Highway at Tioga, located in Tioga Town Center, the second location, opened in 2009, answering the demand for high quality pizza in the more suburban NW Gainesville area. It’s a slightly more “uptown” setting but the food is just as incredible as it is at our original location. We have also been able to add pastas and fabulous daily specials to the menu. The Tioga Town Center location has a lot going on; concerts, movies, shopping and of course great food! All located just 3 miles west of the I75 Newberry Road exit.",
