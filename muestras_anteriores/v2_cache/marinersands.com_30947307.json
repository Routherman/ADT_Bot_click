Erling Speer became responsible for raising the money to fund the development and planning and building the Mariner Sands Community. This year the community was planned and permits were granted, basically as it is today. In late 1979, the first phase of the construction was completed and the Clubhouse opened with a Golf Pro Shop, lobby, small dining room and small locker rooms.\nEnd Mini-Page 21014\nBegin Mini-Page 22854\nAccording to local lore and “The History of Martin County” by Janet Hutchinson, Mariner Sands has more infamy than buried treasure along the Treasure Coast….\nA remote plot of land at Mariner Sands is the family burial ground of the Ashley family and assorted relatives. Some of these individuals gained fame in the early 1900s as an outlaw posse who spent most of their time robbing banks, including the old Stuart Bank - twice. The Stuart Bank was converted into a restaurant, The Ashley, which was later converted into Spritz City Bristro in downtown Stuart.\nThe cemetery is now known as Ashley Park. No further burials are allowed and the latest date shown on the existing headstones is 1946.\nHeavily vandalized before development began, the cemetery was restored by the developer and new headstones were erected around 1987. The inscriptions now show the names of about 15 family members, and others, who are buried there; including two, \"Lost at sea - Dec. 1921\n\"There is a book entitled \"The Notorious Ashley Gang\" by Hix C. Stuart that is believed to be a true account of the Ashley Gang’s history. Today, Ashley Park is a historical place for the enjoyment of Mariner Sands members.\nEnd Mini-Page 22854\nEnd Tabs\n6500 SE Mariner Sands Drive Stuart, Florida 34997\nT: (772) 221-7300\n[email protected]\nSite Map\nContact Us\nEmployment\nLocation\nLogin\n© 2025.\nSite by\nClubessential.",
