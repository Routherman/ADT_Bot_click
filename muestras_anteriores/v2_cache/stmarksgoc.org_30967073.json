      "text": "About Us\nOur Parish History\nThe History of our Parish\nThe Founding\nIn December 2003, through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, members of the community decided to found a new Greek Orthodox Mission in the greater Ocala area, in the hopes of also appealing to and encompassing nearby townships. Father George Papadeas, whose service in Christ was already well-known and respected, agreed to provide spiritual leadership and guidance.\nIn January 2004, the principal of Trinity Catholic High School offered the use of the its chapel for the Mission’s Sunday service. Trinity Catholic HS also generously offered the use of its cafeteria for the Mission’s Agape/Coffee Hour after services.\nWith no funds or supplies, the community came together to plan the Mission’s first liturgy service and within one week everything miraculously came together. An alter cloth was sewed; makeshift icons were manufactured by enlarging internet graphics and pasting them to cardboard; essential liturgical supplies were provided by a retired priest in Miami; and so on. The first Divine Liturgy took place at Trinity Catholic HS on January 11, 2004. The following month, the Mission was formally incorporated with the State of Florida as the Greek Orthodox Mission of Greater Ocala. In only two months, the congregation had grown to 25 parishioners—it would continue to grow every week thereafter.\nIn the beginning of his time with us, Fr. Papadeas held services twice per month to afford him time to care for his beloved wife, Presbytera Bess. That Easter, a miracle in and of itself, a parishioner fabricated an Epitaphio out of PVC pipes, after which the ladies of the Church decorated it with flowers, ferns, and all manner of greenery. It was a beautiful sight to behold, and one which our blessed Presbytera was able to enjoy. She celebrated Easter with us and participated in the Holy Resurrection of our Lord. One week later, she left our earthly realm to be with our Lord and Savior. Fr. Papadeas donated all the memorial donations received on her behalf to our building fund, devoted for the construction of the first phase of our Church. Then he began serving our community every week after his dear wife passed. In order to do this, every Saturday, Father Papadeas (only 92 years young) drove 80 miles from Daytona Beach to Bible Study and would stay for services on Sunday. He said our community helped him grieve and gave him renewed purpose to continue ministering. We were very glad, lucky and honored to have Father Papadeas serving our community.\nSt. Mark the Evangelist Greek Orthodox Church\nSoon thereafter, the community began a search for an existing building/land to purchase for the new Church. After an exhaustive search, 9.6 centrally located acres in Belleview seemed just the right fit. The land was purchased in January 2006. As a result of intense and constant fundraising activities, the community was able to make the purchase and pay the balance of the mortgage in three years.\nFrom that point on, miraculous events occurred in rapid sequence. A parishioner donated 130 trees, which surround the perimeter of the property and comprise the most beautiful part of the Serenity Garden. This donation also included fencing, an irrigation system, a well, and a utility pole. Many Orthodox business persons have come forward to donate their time and expertise in planning, development and related engineering projects, without which our Church would not work. In July 2009, we broke ground on the Church’s most daunting task to date: construction of its 14,000 sq. ft. hall, which includes our chapel. We received our certificate of occupancy from the authorities in 2010. While the Hall remains a work in progress, the chapel is a blessing to behold, and many outstanding events have been held within the hall itself providing schools with testing space and a safe, central location for our popular annual festivals.\nOn May 14, 2011, Metropolitan Alexios, celebrated our Opening  Door Ceremony naming our Church St. Mark the Evangelist. His Eminence also honored Father George by dedicating the hall in his name as the Father George Papadeas Community Center.\nSince November 2013, Father Nick G. Manousakis served the St. Mark Parish as a part-time interim priest, along with many others.\nFr. Gabriel Gadah and Prevytera Dorian were assigned in 2021 and have faithfully served until May 2025.  Under his wise leadership, the Church has grown and attracted many young families!\nOur Blessed Community &\nLooking Forward!\nSt. Mark currently serves the needs of around 100 Christians on any given Sunday Liturgy, with over 75 pledged stewards. But on special events, such as the Holy Pascha, St. Mark welcomes many more!\nWe feel that our brief but colorful history is nothing short of a miracle through which the Holy Spirit continues to work. It is our hope that the Greek Festival, OPA cruise, and other fundraising events will help to build the final missing piece for St. Mark:\na permanent and proper Church Temple!\nWe look forward to growing spiritually, continuing to give, and living in the joyous and loving community spirit that has always been the hallmark of our blessed Church family.\nLast edited: 09/28/2017\n<h1>THE HISTORY OF ST.

Since his passing, we have been honored by the service of many supply priests, not the least of which were Father Christodolous Papadeas and Father Maximos Pafilis, but also Father Michael Soter, Father Nicholas, Father Constantine Tsigas, Father David Rucker, Father Hayes, Father James Rousakis and others who performed a blessed service to our community. We are in their debt and they remain in our prayers.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Our Blessed Community</h2>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<p>To be sure, none of the achievements or building our community has accomplished so far would have been possible without many generous donations of all sizes, community support, and general fundraising activities. Since 2001, our primary fundraiser has been the hosting of an Annual Greek Festival, completely created and managed by our devoted parishioners. The Greek Festival brings together people and visitors from all across the country. Originally, Blessed Trinity generously gave the Church use of its hall, kitchen, and parking facilities for the Festival. For their selfless support, our Church donated a percentage of the profits towards a scholarship for the first few years for a disadvantaged student at Trinity Catholic HS. We also designated some profits for other charitable purposes, besides our own Church. Additionally, we have in the past partnered with Belleview Santos Elementary School and Interfaith Services by donating supplies and participating in Interfaith&rsquo;s Food for Kids &ldquo;Backpack Program,&rdquo; sponsoring over 20 homeless children in need of food.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>But this is not all we have done or continue to do. Our small congregation is characterized by participation in many community activities. We provide testing space in May for Belleview High School. Annually, we are proud to host a dinner dance with live music, delicious food, and diverse fellowship. Our parishioners also look forward to bake sales, bazaars, the Church bookstore, and many other activities.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Not least of these other activities is the OPA Cruise ministry which began as a presentation by Az and Vi Merian in Dr. Cary &amp; Ellen Pantazis&rsquo; living room. The OPA Cruise was started in 2007 by Fr. George Papadeas, Cary &amp; Ellen Pantazis, and Mary Pappas who were honored to help Fr. George establish this worthwhile endeavor. Through their efforts of organizing and running the Cruise for more than eight years in conjunction with Faye Weissblum&rsquo;s dedicated help, its goal to establish and spread Orthodoxy and to financially support Orthodox missions including our own mission, was realized. Our Parish is honored to maintain and manage this wonderful ministry that enjoys a varied program of religious, cultural and culinary experiences as well as on board entertainment. February 2016 will mark the 10th anniversary of our OPA Cruise ministry. Enjoying the fellowship of friends and family while contributing to the spread of Orthodoxy is an awesome experience.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Looking Forward</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>St. Mark&rsquo;s membership currently exceeds 65 pledged families and a weekly newsletter distribution of over 200. We feel that our brief but prolific history is nothing short of a miracle through which the Holy Spirit continues to work. Although we continue to support other charitable organizations, it is our hope and vision that the Greek Festival, OPA Cruise and other fundraising events will help to support the construction of a permanent Sanctuary. We look forward to growing spiritually, continuing to give, and living in the joyous community spirit that our beloved Father George Papadeas established that has always been the hallmark of our blessed St. Mark Church.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Since November 2013, we have been blessed to have Father Nick G. Manousakis serve the St. Mark Parish as a part-time interim priest.</p>\nAbout Us\nPatron Saint\nClergy\nOur Parish History\nSchedule of Services\nChurch Etiquette\nResources",
