Originally named Maggie's Chowder House, it operated until the Konrath family purchased it in the 1950s, and was renamed Fishnet's Bar and Chowder House.  In 1963 the small but mighty restaurant began it's life as Herbie's. In 2014 the Demaras family combined their culinary arts to scratch cooking, craft beer, and smoked meats.\nFAST-FORWARD TO 2023\nWe have the Herbie's of today keeping the tradition alive!\nHerbies Bar and Chowder House\n6350 Overseas Highway, Marathon, Florida 33050, United States\n(305) 743 6373\nCopyright © 2023 Herbies Bar and Chowder House - All Rights Reserved",
