Walking through it was like being in an oasis. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves flowers. –\nTodd F. from Heathcote’s TripAdvisor page.\nHeathcote Botanical Gardens\nconsists of an assortment of specialty gardens including a\nJapanese Garden, Reflection Garden, Herb Garden, Rainforest Display, Native Plants Garden, Secret Garden and a Palm & Cycad Walk\n. These areas convey an atmosphere of individual garden rooms. Through this type of garden design, you will sense the intimacy of this unique botanical garden. Gracing the areas in between these specialty gardens are borders of flowering shrubs, bulbs, trees, vines and other assorted herbaceous plants. Niches found throughout the garden provide varied microclimates, which allows the use of a wide variety of plants ranging from those found in Mediterranean climates to the Tropics.\nHeathcote Botanical Gardens is located on the southeast coast of Florida, in\nUSDA PLANT HARDINESS zone 10A\n, and has both native Florida flora as well as exotic flora from around the world. It is uniquely situated in a biological transition zone between a warm-temperate zone to the north and a subtropical zone to the south. A transition zone contains species that are characteristic of the adjacent region to its north and south, as well as species that occur only in the transition zone. In the botanical world this is advantageous because it allows for greater diversity, which means that one may grow many kinds of plants from around the world that live under conditions associated with three climatic zones.\nVirtual Tour\nHeathcote Shares a Rich History with the Treasure Coast\nOur labeled, plant collections are both grouped in specific areas in the Garden and dispersed throughout the Garden. Other plants of interest that tend to capture many of our visitors’ eyes and spark numerous inquiries have also been labeled. Labeling helps the local Garden visitor determine what plants they have in their own Florida home landscapes or what plants they may want to add.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\nOUR HISTORY\nA plant nursery on Heathcote Street in Scarsdale, New York, was the earliest seed of what has grown and blossomed into Heathcote Botanical Gardens.\nLike many New Yorkers, the business was transplanted to Florida. In 1960 owners Jim and Mollie Crimmins moved the business from its original Florida location on west Orange Avenue to its current Fort Pierce site on Savannah Road.\nThen in 1967 the Crimmins moved their family home from Delaware Avenue to the nursery site. Now known as Heathcote House, the Crimmins’ home was built around 1922.\nToday the Frame Vernacular Style structure sits graciously amid old live oaks. Its second floor balcony, Dade County pine floors, and quaint fireplace all add to its charm. It presently houses administrative offices. In 2001 the City Commission passed a resolution to designate it as a Historically Significant Site based on its architectural characteristics and ties to the life of the community.\nAt the heart of Heathcote is its historical house, now serving as administrative offices.\nJan Bals, Laura Baker, Gloria Moore, Norma Axx, Peggy Berg\nWhen the Crimmins retired, they put the property up for sale. A group of concerned citizens led by Gloria Moore, Chris Haynes, Jan Bals, Norma Carsens, Laura Baker, Gloria Rooks and Peggy Berg saw the unique beauty of the spot and worked hard to preserve it as a public botanical garden. Heathcote Botanical Gardens, Inc., was incorporated in 1985 as a non-profit; and in 1986 the property was purchased with private donations raised by Heathcote Botanical Gardens, Inc., and grants from the state, county, and city. We are fortunate to be able to share some life history of Carol Herzog who spent part of her childhood growing up in the Heathcote House. To read more about her :\nHerzogFullDocument\n.\nToday the non-profit continues to maintain and operate the Gardens and carry forward its mission.\nMember Benefits\nMemberships start at just $45 per year and Heathcote members enjoy a variety of benefits…\nLEARN MORE ABOUT MEMBERSHIP\nMAP OF EXHIBITS\nDownload and print our high-resolution Printable Map.\nGIFT SHOP\nFor a unique shopping experience visit Heathcote Botanical Gardens’ Gift Shop!
