The truth of its quality is self evident it just needs an advocate, a storyteller and an intimate setting to be introduced to it.\nI love Hollywood. It has been my home nearly my entire life and I couldn’t think of a better place to plant my seed. Cinderella shouldn’t have to squeeze her foot into the glass slipper, it should just slide right in. The same can said about finding the right fit for your palate and we work tirelessly to try and reach that end I wanted my truth to be just that simple and not the result of a really good sales pitch or clever packaging.\nGreat wine is our passion and purpose. Our commitment to Hollywood and serving the best possible wine made in an honest way are the tenets that guide us.\nAll of our wines meet a very basic set of standards\nDELICIOUS BUT IN A JOYFUL WAY\nWine by its nature is natural since grapes have all of the necessary ingredients to make themselves into the fermented beverage we know as “wine” but it is incumbent on the producer to assist the process with 1 creative decisions that do not get in the way of the characteristics that tell the story of the resulting wine.\nWhen all of the components come together in a harmonious way that feels complete but not heavy handed, itisajoy to drink, compelling us to take another sip, the way a great meal compels us towards the, anticipation of another delicious bite.\nSMALL PRODUCTION\nThere is something about a “homemade” meal you simply can’t recreate in a chain restaurant That is why a “homemade” meal has a different taste the kind served even in the best restaurants. We are searching for that illusive “homemade” quality in wine and it simply cannot be found in mass produced wines that by their very foundation have no home.\nFARMED PRODUCTS\nAgain this is a quality that most people would assume is inherent but sadly there is a lot of manipulation in wine mostly employed by larger, commercial producers many of whom have ambitiously capitalistic goals that come at the expense of honest winemaking. There are no farms associated with the brands we see lining the shelves at Publix or any other place that has hundreds of outlets because the wineries that make these wines know they can produce a style that is commercially appealing with the use of chemistry and a clever label We don’t sell that kind of wine here. Farming is the most important element in making great wine and when you farm correctly you create a product that is age worthy and satisfying and perhaps even more importantly, honest.\nREPRESENT A SPECIAL PLACE\nHollywood is a special place and I am proud to represent it and that is a quality I seek in the wines we put on our shelf. If the wine comes from Tuscany, it should taste like it It should tell the story of its geography, geology and history. Great wine is like a postcard of a place. It should make you stop and appreciate it but not in a way that obstructs the moments shared in company of the friends and/or food you are sharing the bottle with.\nDELICIOUS BUT IN A JOYFUL WAY\nWine by its nature is natural since grapes have all of the necessary ingredients to make themselves into the fermented beverage we know as “wine” but it is incumbent on the producer to assist the process with 1 creative decisions that do not get in the way of the characteristics that tell the story of the resulting wine.\nWhen all of the components come together in a harmonious way that feels complete but not heavy handed, itisajoy to drink, compelling us to take another sip, the way a great meal compels us towards the, anticipation of another delicious bite.\nSMALL PRODUCTION\nThere is something about a “homemade” meal you simply can’t recreate in a chain restaurant That is why a “homemade” meal has a different taste the kind served even in the best restaurants.
