Originally from Miami, Florida, co-founders Ana and Darlyn (a.k.a Vic) relocated to Fort Myers in 2016. Vic began homebrewing May of 2019, following suggestions from Ana, given his growing love for craft beers at the time, especially NEIPAs. A few months later, they were off to winning awards at local homebrewing competitions.\nVic continued to expand his knowledge for brewing, applying his background in science each step of the way, from learning water chemistry, recipe creation, hop utilization, blending, survivables, the importance of pH, and healthy yeast management. It wasn’t long before their entrepreneurial drive led them to formulate a business plan.
