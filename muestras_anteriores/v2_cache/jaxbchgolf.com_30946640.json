There are 50+ years of history in these greens and fairways, starting out as a private 9-hole course and evolving into 18-holes when the City of Jacksonville Beach acquired the facility. Over the years, Jax Beach Golf Club has had many transformations, but none as extensive as the latest renovation that began in January 2018.\nMore than a facelift, the new course was designed to delight and inspire long-time club members and newcomers alike. Golfers will enjoy a fun, playable yet interesting design by acclaimed golf course architect, Harrison Minchew. Among the improvements are lush fairways of 419 Bermuda grass and greens planted with salt-resistant Platinum Paspalum turf. The drainage and irrigation systems have been modernized and use 100% reclaimed water along with reshaped and reconfigured holes that enhance playability. Golfers will appreciate more par-4 holes and fewer water hazards. The biggest change is in the finish with the reconfigured 16th, 17th, and 18th greens.\nTo round out the renovation, upgrades were done in the Pro Shop and a new restaurant opened to all, Sneakers on the Green. In the Pro Shop, you will find the newest golf attire and accessories as well as equipment for your perfect game. Before, during, and after your round of golf, enjoy breakfast, lunch or a snack with a cold beverage in the restaurant or on the patio overlooking the newly expanded Driving Range. With a new look and new energy, we look forward to players “golf the beach” again!\nj\nContact Us\n605 Penman Road South\nJacksonville Beach, FL 32250\n(904) 247-6184\n[email protected]\nPro Shop\n–\nDaylight Savings Time / Summer Hours\n:\n7:00 A.M. – 6:00 P.M.\nPro Shop\n–\nStandard Time / Winter Hours\n:\n7:00 A.M. – 5:30 P.M.\nRange\n:\nMonday:\n7:00 A.M. – 6:00 P.M.\nTuesday – Sunday:\n7:00 A.M. – 8:00 P.M.\nLast Bucket Sold At 8:00 P.M.\nLights Out At 9:00 P.M.\nRange Opens At 9:00 A.M.\nOn Tuesdays Due To Maintenance.\nRange Closes At 5:00 P.M.\nOn Monday Nights Due To Maintenance.\n** Hours Of Operation Will Be Altered\nBy The Golf Staff Based On Weather\nOr Other Factors On A Daily Basis\nJACKSONVILLE BEACH WEATHER",
