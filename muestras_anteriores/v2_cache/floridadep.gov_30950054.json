      "text": "Meeting the Requirements of the Springs and Aquifer Protection Act\nIn 2016, the Florida Legislature identified 30 \"Outstanding Florida Springs\" that require additional protections to ensure their conservation and restoration for future generations. These protections are included in water quality restoration plans, known as Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs). These plans are focused on reducing nitrogen pollution that is impacting the water quality of these springs.\nImage\nThe legislation requires each BMAP to identify the sources of nitrogen pollution within the springshed, and to include projects and strategies that will achieve the reductions needed to improve water quality in the region. Thirty springs are named as Outstanding Florida Springs by this legislation. Through the DEP’s ongoing assessment efforts, 24 of these springs have been found to have excess levels of nitrogen pollution, particularly nitrate. Sources of nitrogen in these systems can include wastewater, water from septic tanks, stormwater runoff, and fertilizer runoff from both urban and agricultural lands.\nDEP worked with stakeholders to conduct a comprehensive nutrient source inventory and used the inventories to identify the projects and strategies needed to address these sources and achieve the required nitrogen reductions. Nitrogen from agricultural sources and septic tanks has a greater impact on some springs than others, so the BMAPs contain a tailored mix of strategies.\nAs a result of the 1\nst\nDistrict Court of Appeals’ ruling, the 2018 final orders for the Santa Fe River, Silver Springs and Upper Silver River and Rainbow Spring Group and Rainbow River, Suwannee River, and Volusia Blue Spring BMAPs were reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Consequently, the following BMAPs are now currently in effect: 2012 Santa Fe River Basin, 2015 Rainbow Spring Group and Rainbow River, 2015 Silver Springs and Upper Silver River and 2016 Lower and Middle Suwannee River Basin. The Volusia Blue Spring BMAP is under development. For the effective dates for the remaining springs BMAPs, please refer to the table of\nAdopted BMAPs.\nGeneral BMAP Information\nSeptic System Requirements\nFertilizer Requirements\nBMAP Fact Sheet\nDEP BMAP\nUpcoming BMAP Meetings\nSeptic System Fact Sheet\nFAQ Homeowners and Realtors\nFAQ Local Governments\nFAQ Home Builders\nSeptic System Permitting\nFertilizer Fact Sheet\nFlorida-friendly Yards\nAgricultural Best Management Practices",

      "text": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nFlorida’s Coral Reef\nextends over 350 nautical miles from the Dry Tortugas to the St. Lucie Inlet in Martin County. The five counties bordering the reefs are home to over 6 million people. South Florida’s economy and way of life are inextricably linked to the coral reef ecosystem. The reefs provide habitat for species that are valuable to commercial and recreational fisheries, serve as a new frontier for biomedical research, attract tourists who bolster our economy, and protect our coastlines from storms and flooding.\nThe Coral Reef Conservation Program manages the northern section of the reef, from the St. Lucie Inlet to the northern border of Biscayne National Park known as the\nKristin Jacobs Coral Aquatic Preserve\n. These reefs support a rich and diverse assemblage of stony corals, octocorals, macroalgae, sponges and fishes. The Coral Reef Conservation Program coordinates research and monitoring, develops management strategies and promotes partnerships to protect the coral reefs, hardbottom communities and associated reef resources along Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Martin counties.\nThrough its role in supporting Florida's membership on the\nU.S. Coral Reef Task Force\nand the\nU.S. All Islands Committee\n, the Coral Reef Conservation Program leads the implementation of the\nSoutheast Florida Coral Reef Initiative\nand contributes to the National Action Plan to conserve coral reefs. The Coral Reef Conservation Program is also charged with coordinating response to vessel groundings and anchor damage incidents in southeast Florida, and developing strategies to prevent coral reef injuries.\nWhy are living corals valuable?\nCoral reefs are incredible natural resources that support the economy while providing opportunities for recreation, education, scientific research and public inspiration. The fish we catch rely on corals to build the reef structure where they can breed and grow. Current medicines that combat cancer, pain and inflammation have also been derived from coral reef organisms. The total tourism value of Florida's Coral Reef is estimated at $1.1 billion annually. Coral reefs are estimated to annually support 71,000 jobs in South Florida.\nHealthy and resilient coral reefs safeguard against extreme weather, shoreline erosion and coastal flooding. Florida’s Coral Reef provides more than $355 million/year in flood protection benefits to buildings and protects nearly $320 million in annual economic activity (Storlazzi et al. 2019).\nHelpful Links\nImage\nNOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program\n.\nFlorida Reef Resilience Program\n.\nFriends of Our Florida Reefs\nis the citizen support organization for the DEP Coral Reef Conservation Program.\nStony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) informational page\n.\nIf you are interested in receiving updates or would like to sign up as a stakeholder, please email:\nCoral@floridadep.gov\n.",

      "text": "About Florida Sinkholes\n***If there is a risk of physical harm, please call your local law enforcement agency***\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection does not inspect possible sinkholes.\nMany common questions involving sinkholes are answered by\nDEP's Sinkholes FAQs\nand FGS publication Leaflet 20,\nA Homeowner's Guide to Sinkholes in Florida\n. Should you have additional questions, you may call the\nFGS Sinkhole Helpline at 850-245-2118\n.\nNOTE:\nThis is a helpline provided to clarify the information presented in the FAQs; answer any additional sinkhole questions; and provide verbal guidance relating to a sinkhole situation.\nFor insurance questions, please contact the\nFlorida Department of Financial Services Division of Consumer Services\n.\nFor information about your rights as a renter or a landlord, review\nThe Florida Bar's Consumer Pamphlet\n.\nFor an assessment, please contact a certified home inspector or foundation specialist in your area.\nMedia callers: Please contact the DEP Press Office at 850-245-2118.\nImage\nSinkholes are a common feature of Florida's landscape. They are only one of many kinds of karst landforms, which include caves, disappearing streams, springs and underground drainage systems, all of which occur in Florida. Karst is a generic term that refers to the characteristic terrain produced by erosional processes associated with the chemical weathering and dissolution of limestone or dolomite, the two most common carbonate rocks in Florida. Dissolution of carbonate rocks begins when they are exposed to acidic water. Most rainwater is slightly acidic and usually becomes more acidic as it moves through decaying plant debris.\nLimestones in Florida are porous, allowing the acidic water to percolate through their strata, dissolving some limestone and carrying it away in solution. Over eons of time, this persistent erosional process has created extensive underground voids and drainage systems in much of the carbonate rocks throughout the state. Collapse of overlying sediments into the underground cavities produces sinkholes.\nWhen groundwater discharges from an underground drainage system, it is a spring, such as Wakulla Springs, Silver Springs or Rainbow Springs. Sinkholes can occur in the beds of streams, sometimes taking all of the stream's flow, creating a disappearing stream. Dry caves are parts of karst drainage systems that are above the water table, such as the Florida Caverns in Marianna.\nOther subterranean events can cause holes, depressions or subsidence of the land surface that may mimic sinkhole activity. These include subsurface expansive clay or organic layers that compress as water is removed; collapsed or broken sewer and drain pipes; broken septic tanks; improperly compacted soil after excavation work; and buried trash, logs and other debris. Often a depression is not verified by a licensed professional geologist or engineer to be a true sinkhole, and the cause of subsidence is not known. Such events are called subsidence incidents.\nImage\nSubsidence Incident Reports\nImage\nFlorida Karst Resources\nImage\nSinkhole FAQs",
