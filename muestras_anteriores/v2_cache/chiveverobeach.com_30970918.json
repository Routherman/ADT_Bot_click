Chive opened in a small space on Old Dixie Highway in 2013. It quickly became a favorite for Quick, Creative Cuisine and a popular place for lunch. Lou earned the honor of Top Chef for Vero Beach in 2013. Our popularity grew, the menu expanded to include a suggestion menu for the novice customer. A second location was opened on Royal Palm Pointe in 2014 and expanded to offer more seating. In late 2018, Chive moved to it’s current location on Miracle Mile which includes a full service bar, even more seating, and an expanded patio for dining.\n​\nPrior to  opening each location, Lou spent months painting, cleaning, & personally designing all the artwork throughout the restaurant. Take a few minutes to enjoy the recycled pallets, turned artwork. We hope you feel welcome & enjoy the restaurant as much as we do. We value your opinion & use your feedback to move towards becoming your choice for quick, creative cuisine in Vero Beach.\n​\nDon’t forget Chive offers party platters and full service catering for all your events, big or small.\n​\nChive offers fresh toppings and proteins cooked to order to ensure quality meals every day. Whether you are in the mood for some fresh fish options, a healthy salad, tacos, burrito, sandwich, or rice & bean bowl, there is something for everyone. Our menu allows everyone to create their own meal.\n​\nIn 2017, Lou opened the\nGreen Marlin Restaurant & Raw Bar\nto provide a relaxing atmosphere for Vero Beach residents to be able to enjoy the freshest seafood.  We felt Vero Beach was missing a casual sit-down restaurant that offered fresh oysters & top notch seafood at an affordable price.\n​\nBe sure to keep an eye out for a Chive coming to your neighborhood.\nWe love cooking for you!\nABOUT\nchive\nOur Story ...\n​\nLou Kolbauer is the owner and creative mind behind this local favorite.
