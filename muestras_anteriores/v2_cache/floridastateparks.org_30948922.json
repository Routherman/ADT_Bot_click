Most common injuries result from boat strikes.\nThe state park also participates in the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s Manatee Rescue, Rehabilitation and Release Program. The park cares for injured or ill manatees until they can safely be released back into the wild.\nMore information available from the\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\nProgram Registration\nRegistration is not required.\nProgram Cost\nFree with park admission and includes a 15 to 20 minute talk followed by a feeding of the park’s captive manatees.\nTimes\nOffered three times daily:\n11:30 a.m.\n1:30 p.m.\n3:30 p.m.\nLocation\nApril 1 - November 14\nUnderwater Observatory\nNovember 15 - March 31\nManatee Care Facility\nParticipating Parks\nEllie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park\nManatee Educational Program\nProgram Registration\nRegistration is not required.\nProgram Cost\nFree with park admission and includes a 15 to 20 minute talk followed by a feeding of the park’s captive manatees.\nTimes\nOffered three times daily:\n11:30 a.m.\n1:30 p.m.\n3:30 p.m.\nLocation\nApril 1 - November 14\nUnderwater Observatory\nNovember 15 - March 31\nManatee Care Facility\nParticipating Parks\nEllie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park\nHave Questions?\nContact the Statewide Information Line:\n(850) 245-2157\nOr send an email to:\nFSP.Feedback@FloridaDEP.gov\nStay Connected\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nPinterest\nYou Tube",
