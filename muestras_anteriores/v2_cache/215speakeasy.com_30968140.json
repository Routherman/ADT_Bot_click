Raised in diverse locales such as New Caledonia and Tahiti, Vincent's upbringing was deeply influential, instilling in him a profound appreciation for global cuisines and cultures.\nVincent attended culinary school and earned his degree as a Chef within two years, receiving the prestigious “Best Chef Apprentice” award in France in 2002. In Paris, Vincent had the opportunity to work in a two Michelin stars restaurant for many years.\nIn February 2013, Vincent embarked on his most significant adventure yet: moving to America. He joined team to build a new project and just three months later, Le Rendez-Vous became the place where Vincent's talent and charm flourished.\nVincent’s role as Head Mixologist at Le Rendez-Vous allowed him to share his joy and creativity with many. He believes, \"It’s not about the ingredients you use, it’s the love you put into everything.\" After Le Rendez-Vous, Vincent founded 215 Speakeasy in 2017. What began as a bar has now become a renowned trademark.\nVincent has won numerous cocktail competitions, conducted cocktail classes at prestigious events like yacht parties , wedings , Formula 1 launches, and served as a guest bartender in various venues. His relentless pursuit of growth and passion for sharing his knowledge continue to inspire those around him.\nConnect With Us\nInstagram\n215 Speakeasy\n(514) 463-8282\nCopyright © 2025 215 Speakeasy - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by",
