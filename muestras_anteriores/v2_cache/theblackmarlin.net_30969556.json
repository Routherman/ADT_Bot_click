      "text": "Our Story\nLocated at the former site of the oldest tavern in Stuart, The Black Marlin has established itself as one of downtown Stuart’s favorite dining and drinking spots.\nThe exposed brick walls and cozy wooden booths are the perfect backdrop for this “not so intimate” 99 seat restaurant. In addition to the regular menu, The Black Marlin, offers nightly dinner and appetizer specials, usually featuring fresh local seafood delivered daily, to ensure you always have something new and exciting to try with each visit.\nOpen since 1993, our bartenders will be glad to mix your favorite martini, pour you a cold craft beer on draft or bottle, and can fill you in on what’s happening in the greater Stuart area. With a strong focus on making quality crafted cocktails, this bar is a must visit for a drink enthusiast. We offer a wide variety of scotches, bourbons, whiskeys, and aged rums, in addition to the other great spirits you are accustomed to seeing. Check in to see whats new on our ever changing cocktail menu and try one of our barrel aged cocktails when available. Bar is open until midnight, so come and check out the local’s favorite downtown spot.\nThe Location's History\nThis is a very special space for us, but it is also quite a gem in Stuart’s local history.\nThis space is the former site of the oldest tavern in Stuart and has been welcoming the community and serving residents and visitors since the early 1900s! Dirr’s Bar, Horseshoe Bar and Jerry’s Bar all called this place home before we set down our roots. In 2020, we expanded The Black Marlin’s original space to welcome more friendly faces.\nIn 2023 we celebrated 30 years of The Black Marlin serving our wonderful community! This space has seen a lot of local history over the years, and we are so proud to be a part of it and keep it going!\nClick on the image above to enlarge\nHistorical photos courtesy of\nMartin Digital History\nHappy Hour\nfor the great vibes\nDinner\nfor local favorites\nLibations\nfor crafted perfection\nOur affiliation with the renowned Prawnbroker Restaurant Group, a multi-concept seafood restaurant group that set sail in Florida’s culinary waters in 1978, solidifies our commitment to excellence in seafood cuisine and genuine hospitality.
