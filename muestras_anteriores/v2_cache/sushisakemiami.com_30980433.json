Our South Florida-inspired menu features local favorites such as the Miami Heat roll packed with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, crab salad and topped with baked salmon, spicy mayo and eel sauce. For a Floridian twist on Japanese mainstays, our Pineapple Fried Rice is a crowd favorite.\nWe offer something for everyone with\ntraditional Japanese cuisine that features an expansive menu of hibachi, teriyaki, sushi and sashimi, as well as our homemade signature sauces and variety of Sake selections. We also feature daily specials, and a lunch and dinner menu that can be ordered through delivery or takeout.\n30+ Locations throughout Florida\nOver the years Sushi Sake has expanded to over\n30 locations throughout South Florida\n.
