      "text": "Home\nAbout\nHomes for Sale\nBoat Slips\nContact\nAbout\nCrescent Lake Waterfront Community is a manufactured home community that feels like old Florida. Itâs a 55 and older land lease private community thatâs surrounded by nature on 3 sides. To the north is 3 acres of undeveloped city owned land with a neighboring dog park in walking distance from our pet friendly community. To the south is undeveloped land divided by a natural creek. To the east is 450 feet of pristine waterfront. Â Across the street, walking distance from the community is the Winn Dixie grocery store. All you will ever need is in walking distance.\nAvailable to the residents, right outside the doorstep of your home, is your own private boat slip that can take you away to the ultimate fishing experience. People travel from all around to enjoy the experience of fishing and catching the most amazing size Crappie and Bass, to name a few. Â The all sports lake will absorb your boat of most any size and allow you to travel up to the adventurous Â St. Johnâs River or enjoy any one of the numerous bar or restaurants available by boat, through the neighboring cities. Â Donât wait any longer and\ncontact us\ntoday to secure your own home with the world at your doorstep!\nGallery\nProperty Map\n(c) Copyright 2025 Crescent Lake Waterfront Community, LLC.\nCrescent City, Florida USA",
