      "text": "About Angelina’s\nAbout Angelina’s\nIn April of 2008, Angelina’s Ristorante opened its doors in Bonita Springs, Florida, and ushered in guests to a Mediterranean oasis of delicious food, fine wines, and the promise of incomparable experiences. More than a decade later, we are now one of Southwest Florida’s most awarded fine dining restaurants and we are still just as passionate about providing Unmatched Fine Italian in all aspects.\nYour unmatched experience begins at the door with our friendly, complimentary valet. As you’re escorted inside, your ears will be delighted by the fine art of live piano music drifting through the dining rooms. While you’re guided to your table, you can take in the spectacular sight that is our unique 30-foot refrigerated wine tower containing more than 4,000 bottles from around the world.\nOur meticulously trained service staff will then wine, dine, and dazzle you with traditional Italian hospitality. Our sommeliers will provide you with experienced recommendations per your tastes, while our Executive Chef will prepare your exquisite meal utilizing classic, top-of-the-line ingredients imported directly from Italy. When your evening comes to an end, we hope you are departing with delightful, unmatched memories and plans to come and see us again soon.\nWe cannot wait to say Benvenuti Angelina’s to you and your family. View our operating hours\nhere\nand make a reservation by clicking\nhere\n, or by calling us at (239) 390-3187.\nOur Dress Code\nWe kindly request all our guests dress to impress and adhere to our business casual dress code when they choose Angelina’s for fine dining. All guests should avoid casual clothing items such as t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and any form of beachwear. Men are requested to avoid open-toed shoes. Clothing should be neat and clean, and appropriately cover areas such as the chest, stomach, back, and upper thighs. Grazie!\nAwards & Press\nWe are proud to be one of Southwest Florida’s most awarded restaurants, including the coveted Wine Spectator Best of Award of Excellence since 2012 and the only Golden Spoon awardee in Bonita Springs.\nOur latest visit to Angelina’s proved to be further confirmation that this is our “go to” venue for celebrations, holidays, special occasions, or “just because.” Our server, as always, was attentive, funny, and accommodating. The food was nothing less than spectacular and, most importantly, consistent with what we’ve come to expect. Everyone in our party was satisfied with both the portion sizes and quality/flavor of our respective entrees. The appetizers are always delicious and satisfying as well. Their wine selection is second to none! Finally, the live piano player is the cherry on top, and will entertain with everything from classics to more modern fare. If you’ve never been, treat yourself.
