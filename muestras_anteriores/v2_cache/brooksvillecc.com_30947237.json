Big old oaks, open fairways and old Cory holes on the back nine.\nVicki Anderson\nFeedback from Google\nFun course. The back 9 tee shots are definitely not the typical view from a tee box on a Florida golf course. Greens were super slow but they were in good condition. Definitely recommend\nAlan Matthew\nFeedback from Google\nThe course was in great shape, greens were fast and rolled true.  Stay  in the fairways and in the right position and you will good, get out of position and you will be hard-pressed to make par.  Lunch was good with the restaurant and staff was very accommodating.  I would recommend the course to anyone that ask.\nDennie LaPorte\nFeedback from Google\nPlaying at Brookville Country Club was an absolute delight!
