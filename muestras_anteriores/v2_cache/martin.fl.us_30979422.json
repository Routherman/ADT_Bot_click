Martin, Governor of Florida from 1925 to 1929.\nBy the authority of the Constitution of the State of Florida, the Martin County Board of County Commissioners shares the functions of government with Martin County’s Constitutional Officers.\nMartin County’s five Commissioners are each elected to serve a four-year term. These terms are staggered and each member is elected at-large but represents a geographic district within the county.\nThe Chairperson of the Commission is elected annually by the other Board members and presides over all Board meetings. The Board meets on several Tuesdays each month and all meetings are open to the public.\nThe Board of County Commissioners has responsibility for the provision of general government services (fire/rescue, library services, building inspections), oversees the development of infrastructure (roads, utilities, parks), and determines regulations regarding zoning and land use provisions.\nThe Board is also responsible for determining the millage rate (tax on real property) to fund all functions of County government with the exception of the Tax Collector and most court-related functions.\nThe Board of County Commissioners is a policymaking board and they approve the County’s operating and capital budgets, pass ordinances, and take actions that provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Martin County.\nMartin County Vision Statement:\nMartin County government is value and service driven. Martin County will be known locally, regionally, statewide and nationally as an innovative and progressive leader, providing cost-effective County services. Others will benchmark against Martin County as an example of the best in local government. The citizens and the Board of County Commissioners will be proud of the staff and have a firm belief in the reliability, truth and strength of the organization.\nAccessibility Statement\nMartin County is committed to ensuring website accessibility for people with disabilities.
