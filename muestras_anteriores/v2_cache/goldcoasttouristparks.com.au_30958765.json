Strategically located on the edge of the Asia-Pacific rim, with access to two international airports, the Gold Coast is perfectly positioned as a destination for business, investment, study, sport, events, tourism and lifestyle. Situated in the south east corner of the state of Queensland, the Gold Coast stretches along 57 kilometres of coastline and is home to over half a million people. Beyond the city’s beautiful beaches are vast, sub-tropical rainforests with breathtaking scenery, the perfect holiday destination for those from near and far.\nWelcoming close to 12 million visitors each year, the Gold Coast is full of attractions and things to do. As Australia’s premier tourist destination, the city offers a vibrant mix of shopping, accommodation, theme parks, restaurants, entertainment, festivals, sporting and other events, along with an abundance of natural attractions. The Gold Coast has developed into a diverse, cosmopolitan, forward-thinking city with a future full of promise.\nThe City of Gold Coast owns seven mainland tourist parks and three island campgrounds located across the Gold Coast. Camping and caravanning holidays have been part of the social and cultural fabric of the Gold Coast, spanning three centuries. Camping at Coolangatta and Kirra Beach has been happening since as far back as the 1800’s and photographic evidence records camping at Burleigh Heads and Main Beach in the early 1900’s. The Gold Coast Tourist Parks team are proud of the rich history of camping on the Gold Coast and work hard to ensure that we preserve this for generations to come.\nOur Gold Coast Tourist Parks contribute a total of 480,000 site nights to the Gold Coast’s accommodation sector with approximately 135,000 visitors each year. Thanks to our partnership with the State Government who provides the City with trusteeship over the land allocations for the majority of our parks, the city can continue to offer affordable camping and recreation holidays in prime locations. With the Gold Coast being Australia’s second largest Council and 6th largest city, we know that we are in a very special and enviable position to have so many caravan and camping options available in prime locations within our City. Whilst many other parks in prime locations are given over to competing land uses, the Gold Coast is one of the last major cities in Australia to maintain such parks, which in our case, there is no doubt to their iconic status.\nVISION\nIn 2017 Gold Coast Tourist Parks set a bold new vision “to be the best caravan and camping destination in Australia”.\nTo see that vision realised, we have two key objectives.\n1) World Class Destinations\nWe want to match our world-class locations with world-class facilities. Changes in guest expectations require us to take a fresh approach to our future planning for assets. As such, in 2019 we undertook a full review of all of our existing assets and developed a new plan for future investment.\n2) World Class Guest Experience\nOur Tourist Park locations and our Gold Coast region are ‘world-class’ and we want to match that with a world-class guest experience. To us, building a culture of service that makes every visit completely care free for you and delivered with Gold Coast love and energy is what, we believe, is world-class.\nWorld-class isn’t intended to convey big facilities, lots of facilities or even expensive facilities.

Strategically located on the edge of the Asia-Pacific rim, with access to two international airports, the Gold Coast is perfectly positioned as a destination for business, investment, study, sport, events, tourism and lifestyle. Situated in the south east corner of the state of Queensland, the Gold Coast stretches along 57 kilometres of coastline and is home to over half a million people. Beyond the city’s beautiful beaches are vast, sub-tropical rainforests with breathtaking scenery, the perfect holiday destination for those from near and far.\nWelcoming close to 12 million visitors each year, the Gold Coast is full of attractions and things to do. As Australia’s premier tourist destination, the city offers a vibrant mix of shopping, accommodation, theme parks, restaurants, entertainment, festivals, sporting and other events, along with an abundance of natural attractions. The Gold Coast has developed into a diverse, cosmopolitan, forward-thinking city with a future full of promise.\nThe City of Gold Coast owns seven mainland tourist parks and three island campgrounds located across the Gold Coast. Camping and caravanning holidays have been part of the social and cultural fabric of the Gold Coast, spanning three centuries. Camping at Coolangatta and Kirra Beach has been happening since as far back as the 1800’s and photographic evidence records camping at Burleigh Heads and Main Beach in the early 1900’s. The Gold Coast Tourist Parks team are proud of the rich history of camping on the Gold Coast and work hard to ensure that we preserve this for generations to come.\nOur Gold Coast Tourist Parks contribute a total of 480,000 site nights to the Gold Coast’s accommodation sector with approximately 135,000 visitors each year. Thanks to our partnership with the State Government who provides the City with trusteeship over the land allocations for the majority of our parks, the city can continue to offer affordable camping and recreation holidays in prime locations. With the Gold Coast being Australia’s second largest Council and 6th largest city, we know that we are in a very special and enviable position to have so many caravan and camping options available in prime locations within our City. Whilst many other parks in prime locations are given over to competing land uses, the Gold Coast is one of the last major cities in Australia to maintain such parks, which in our case, there is no doubt to their iconic status.\nVISION\nIn 2017 Gold Coast Tourist Parks set a bold new vision “to be the best caravan and camping destination in Australia”.\nTo see that vision realised, we have two key objectives.\n1) World Class Destinations\nWe want to match our world-class locations with world-class facilities. Changes in guest expectations require us to take a fresh approach to our future planning for assets. As such, in 2019 we undertook a full review of all of our existing assets and developed a new plan for future investment.\n2) World Class Guest Experience\nOur Tourist Park locations and our Gold Coast region are ‘world-class’ and we want to match that with a world-class guest experience. To us, building a culture of service that makes every visit completely care free for you and delivered with Gold Coast love and energy is what, we believe, is world-class.\nWorld-class isn’t intended to convey big facilities, lots of facilities or even expensive facilities. World-class to us is to be considered among the best in the world and with our superb Gold Coast locations, hospitality and lifestyle, we believe we are already among the best city caravan and camping parks in the world and will continue to work to ensure our facilities and services are deserving of your visit.\nGUEST EXPERIENCE STANDARD\nTo deliver on our vision, the Gold Coast Tourist Parks team is committed to continual improvement. In 2019, we have created a set of standards to which we hold ourselves and our teams accountable. By doing this, we can provide you with assurance that we will continue to imbed these standards in everything we do so that you, our valued guest, can enjoy your well-deserved holiday.\nDownload a copy of our Guest Experience Standard Here\n.\nTemplate: 02_generic/_blocks/image-gallery.twig\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nJacobs Well Tourist Park\nEmail:\njacobs@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 760\n07 5667 2760\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n1161 Pimpama-Jacobs Well Rd,\nJacobs Well, QLD 4208\nReception hours\n9:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Daily, Christmas day closed\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nTipplers Campground South Stradbroke Island\nEmail:\ntipplers@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n(07) 5577 2849\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\nSouth Stradbroke Island, QLD 4216, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Daily\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nNorth Currigee Campground South Stradbroke Island\nEmail:\ncurrigee@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n(07) 5577 3932\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\nCurrigee Rd, South Stradbroke QLD\nReception hours\n7:30am\nto\n7:30pm\n— Daily\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nSouth Currigee Campground South Stradbroke Island\nEmail:\ncurrigee@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n(07) 5577 3932\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\nSouth Stradbroke Island, QLD 4216, Australia\nReception hours\n8:30am\nto\n11:30am\n— Daily\n2:00pm\nto\n4:30pm\n— Public Holidays\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nBroadwater Tourist Park\nEmail:\nbwater@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 730\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n169 Marine Parade, Southport, QLD 4215, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Daily, Christmas day closed\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nMain Beach Tourist Park\nEmail:\nmain@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 720\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n3600 Main Beach Parade, Main Beach, QLD 4217, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Daily, Christmas day closed\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nOcean Beach Tourist Park\nEmail:\nocean@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 710\n(07) 5667 2710\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n22 Hythe Street, Miami, QLD 4220, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Monday-Friday\n9:00am\nto\n5:00pm\n— weekends and public holidays, Christmas day closed\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nBurleigh Beach Tourist Park\nEmail:\nburly@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 750\n(07) 5667 2750\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n36 Goodwin Tce, Burleigh Heads, QLD 4220, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Monday-Friday\n9:00am\nto\n5:00pm\n— weekends and public holidays, Christmas day closed\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nTallebudgera Creek Tourist Park\nEmail:\ntally@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 700\n(07) 5667 2700\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n1544 Gold Coast Hwy,Palm Beach, QLD 4221, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Daily, Christmas day closed\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nTemplate: contact/_contact-park-item.twig\nKirra Beach Tourist Park\nEmail:\nkirra@gctp.com.au\nPhone:\n1300 672 740\n(07) 5667 2740\nTemplate: 02_generic/_layouts/social-list.twig\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nAddress:\n10 Charlotte Street, Coolangatta, QLD 4225, Australia\nReception hours\n8:00am\nto\n5:00pm\n— Daily, off-peak season\n8:00am\nto\n6:00pm\n— Daily, peak season (school holidays, long weekends, special events).
