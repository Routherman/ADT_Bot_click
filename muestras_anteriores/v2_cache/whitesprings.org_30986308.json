The Town Council is elected by the voters and, in turn, the Council appoints a professionally trained individual as its Town Manager. It is the responsibility of the Town Manager to handle day-to-day operation of city business. The Town Council makes policy decisions and votes on all legislative or quasi-judicial matters required or enabled by State or Federal law.\nAll of the seats on the Council are at-large seats which means all council represent the Town at large and not any particular district. This allows residents to address particular issues with any council Member. View our full Town Organizational Chart.\nElections\nTown elections are held the 4th Tuesday of April each year. Even number years the town elects three council members and odd numbered years two are elected. The candidate who polls the highest number of votes for office shall be declared the winner thereof. The officials are sworn in the following Thursday after the election at which time the council elects among itself a mayor and vice mayor.\nMeetings\nThe Town Council meets at 6:30 p.m. on the second Tuesday of each month in the Town Hall Council Chambers, unless otherwise noted. Your questions and comments are welcomed. The meeting is open to the public.\nTown Government\nLee Garner\nTown Manager\nCynethia Williams\nUtility Clerk / Administrative Assistant\nTown Council\n[if IE]><div class=\"ie\"><![endif]\nAgendas & Minutes\n[if IE]></div><![endif]\nContact Information\nAddress:\nTown of White Springs, Florida\nP.O.
