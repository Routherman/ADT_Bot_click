Its Mediterranean architecture, spectacular landscapes and sense of style offer an experience that is unsurpassed in South Florida. Located in upscale Coral Gables, the Registered Historic Landmark offers a blend of timeless elegance combined with modern amenities and conveniences. The Biltmore is also home to the legendary Biltmore Golf Course – an 18-hole, par-71 championship course, originally designed in 1925 by architect Donald Ross.\nBuilding a Dream\n1924 – 1925\nGeorge E. Merrick was the man behind the creation of Coral Gables. But he wanted more. He wanted to create a hotel in Miami’s latest hotspot – one that was a center for sports, fashion, and grand living. Merrick joined forces with hotel magnate John McEntee Bowman during the Florida land boom, and they set their sights on building South Florida’s preeminent hotel. The Biltmore is the centerpiece of George Merrick’s vision of Coral Gables as an elegant, stately suburb, which he called The City Beautiful. The 10-million-dollar project was announced on November 25, 1924, and in less than 14 months, The Biltmore was unveiled to the public amid great fanfare in January of 1926. One might say he was building a dream, a dream that came true when the masterpiece of the Biltmore at the city’s epicenter was completed in 1926.\nThe Jazz Age\n1926 – 1942\nWith the Jazz Age in full swing, the elegant Biltmore attracted royalty of both the European and Hollywood variety. Guests enjoyed fashion shows, gala balls, and aquatic shows in the grand pool. It hosted world-class golf tournaments. Big Bands entertained wealthy visitors to this American Riviera resort.\nThe War Years\n1942 -1968\nThe ‘War Years’ saw the Biltmore serve as an Army Air Forces hospital, and the early site of the University of Miami’s School of Medicine. The hotel remained a Veterans Administration hospital until 1968 when it finally closed its doors.\nThe Next Step\n1983 – 1990\nIn 1973, the City of Coral Gables was granted ownership of the hotel under the Historic Monuments Act and Legacy of Parks program, but the hotel continued to remain unoccupied for years to come. Finally, in 1983, the city initiated a full restoration to return The Biltmore to its former glory as a grand hotel and it reopened in 1987 as a four-star hotel and resort. However, after three years, in 1990, The Biltmore closed amid the country’s economic downturn.\nA New Era Begins\n1992 – Present\nA new era began in 1992, when Seaway Hotels Group, chaired by Gene Prescott and his son Tom Prescott, became the operator of the resort and golf course. They embarked on a 10-year, $40 million renovation project to renovate the public spaces and guest rooms. A state-of-the-art fitness center and spa were added. The golf course was restored to its original Donald Ross design. And the Biltmore’s landmark pool was refurbished, adding a tropical waterfall and private cabanas. Today, the Landmark is indeed as elegant as the day she opened. The Biltmore’s rich history makes it Coral Gables’ most preeminent historic landmark.\nBuilding a Dream\n1924 – 1925\nGeorge E.
