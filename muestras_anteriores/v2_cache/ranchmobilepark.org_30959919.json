      "text": "Message from the Board\n.entry-header\n8/4/2025\nUpdate on the Branch Creek Clean-up from the City of Largo\nDear Ranch Mobile Home Park Residents and Board Members,\nI hope this message finds you well.\nI’d like to provide a summary of the recent coordination and maintenance activities related to the drainage ditch along 150th Avenue in Largo, Florida.\nMeeting Summary:\nFDOT (Florida Department of Transportation):\nFDOT attended the site visit and confirmed that their section of the ditch remains within acceptable maintenance tolerances and is functioning as intended. Benjamin Smith of FDOT will provide a follow-up email with details regarding their herbicide spraying schedule and continued maintenance plans.\nFDOT’s contractor, Webber, has been tasked with providing a timeline for herbicide treatment and larger vegetation removal as part of their routine schedule. It was clarified that FDOT is not currently planning a full dredging or vegetation removal project, as existing conditions do not warrant it. FDOT and Webber will continue to monitor and respond to any blockages as needed.\nCity of Largo:\nAndre Frazier, Stormwater Supervisor for Open Conveyance Maintenance, attended the meeting and shared details about the City’s maintenance responsibilities and schedule. The city will continue to manage their portion of the ditch through routine inspections and vegetation control as necessary. In addition to standard maintenance, the City has also contracted aquatic spraying services to further manage vegetation and ensure proper flow within this section of the drainage system.\nPinellas County:\nI provided an overview of the County’s maintenance activities, which include slope mowing, aquatic spraying, and hand cleaning on a recurring 4–6-week cycle. I am in the process of confirming the exact schedule and will email that information to all attendees once finalized. Additionally, I’ve reached out to the hand cleaning crew to address some trash observed in the ditch during our visit.\nClosing Remarks:\nAll parties involved have agreed that the ditch is currently functioning as intended and that scheduled maintenance is being carried out appropriately. Agencies will continue to monitor and maintain their respective areas and coordinate as needed moving forward.\nIf any concerns arise regarding flow or obstruction in the ditch, please do not hesitate to report them so they can be addressed promptly.\nAndre Frazier  Stormwater Supervisor Public Works/Streets and Stormwater | City of Largo (727) 587-6740 x4304 | Afrazier@largo.com |\nLargo.com\nDisclaimer: According to Florida Public Records Law, email correspondence to and from the City of Largo, including email addresses and other personal information, is public record and must be made available to public and media upon request, unless otherwise exempt by the Public Records Law.\nUPDATE:  7/21/2025\n07/17/2025\nPLEASE NOTE NEW DATE!\nTHURSDAY, July 24, 2025\nWater Main Valves are being worked on\nBe prepared for intermittent water shut offs throughout the day\n07/11/2025 UPDATE ON LAKE RD CLOSURE\nThe intersection of Lake Rd. and 142nd Ave. is now open.\n07/08/2025, 3:35 PM WATER IS BACK ON!\n07/08/2025\nURGENT.

Residents can contact the office either by phone or email.  Also, the office can again process any sales closings that may be needed.  But please keep in mind that the office is undergoing major renovation and, we currently have no roof or AC.\n10/19/2024 Update\nThose of us who are currently in residence at Ranch Mobile know that the pictures posted do not begin to tell the story of the damage done by both Hurricane Helene and Milton.  The road to recovery will take time, but we will come back stronger just like the other communities around us.\nPlease know that the maintenance staff, office staff, volunteer residents, our service providers and the Board are all working diligently to complete the repairs and clean-up required to restore park facilities.  Please remember to show kindness, patience and support to all who have been affected.  These are the qualities that make us a great community!\nHere is an update on where the Park stands with repairs:\nThe good news!  The maintenance team and volunteers have worked diligently, and all clubhouses are open for use.\nOffice – Currently, the office has no telephone or internet service.  We are waiting on Spectrum to determine the cause.  Either Faith or Nancy check emails at night on their personal home computers. We are in the process of drying out files that were damaged by water.  One computer that was damaged has been repaired.   The furniture is being removed and will need to be replaced.  We have contacted contractors to remove the AC on top of the roof and to disconnect the power so that roofers can come and remove the remaining damaged metal roof and tarp the office roof.  The roof will need replacing. We have met with two contractors so far and hope to have bids by next week.  The timeline for roof replacement is undetermined until we receive bids and award the contract.  The paneling will need to be removed as it is buckling from being wet and to avoid mold to growth.  The office was the park facility damaged the most.   We hope to be able to open the office by the end of next week on a limited-service basis.  The repairs will take much longer.  We will keep you posted as we progress.\nIf someone is interested in buying or selling a home, they will need to contact the office through email for the time being:\nrranchmobile1@brighthouse.com\nNo home closings can occur until we have internet access restored.\nWe ask that unless it is an emergency or a key issue, you do not go to the office to allow this work to move as quickly as possible.\nTrash – Waste Pro is taking what they can, but please remember that the Monday and Thursday pick-up is for household trash.  The bulk pick-up is the last Saturday of the month, October 26.  Do not become upset if they do not take bulk items, construction debris or yard waste on a Monday or Thursday.  Truck space is limited, and the lines are very long at the landfills for disposal.  When it comes to bulk items, construction debris, or yard debris please keep the three categories separated.  Some additional reminders:\nCarpeting, even area rugs, should be 3 to 4 foot in length, rolled and tied.\nGlass or mirrors must be in a plastic bin, taped shut and marked as glass for the protection of the workers.\nConstruction debris must be removed by your contractor.\nIf you are doing the work yourself, the debris must be neatly organized so that it can be easily picked up.  Nails must be removed to avoid any injuries.  You are limited to the amount of construction debris allowed for bulk pick-up day.  Concrete, stones or bricks will not be taken. If you have a great deal, consider renting a dumpster.\nYard waste such as tree branches must be no longer than 3 to 4 feet and be tied and bundled.\nIf you have aluminum or metal items, the scrappers are in the park, let them know if you want them to take anything.  We believe some residents have posted names and numbers on Facebook of people who do this service.\nIf you are in doubt, please look at the website for trash pick-up procedures.\nPool facilities – The pool must be drained, cleaned, and refilled.  The filters can then be checked for any possible damage.  Artistic Pool has been hired to complete this task.  We are optimistic that the pool facilities will be available in approximately a month.  We are on a long list of communities needing this service.\nPalm Trees – Matthew’s will be in the park within the next week either removing or bracing damaged park palm trees.  Lawn mowing will be Tuesday, October 22.  They will mow lawns that they can access without debris.  They will also use the truck sweeper to clean the streets to remove as much of the washed-out materials as possible.\nThank you for your patience and assistance as we continue to work toward restoring our park facilities.\nRanch Mobile Board of Governors\n10/17/2024\nDear Residents of Ranch,\nHopefully this note finds you all safe.\nAfter the recent damaging hurricane Milton we would encourage each of you to proactively assess any damages you may have incurred at your mobile home.\nDue to the flooding in the Park many homes with a ground floor shed,  room or addition will have had water intrusion with subsequent water damage.\nThe board members will not be going around and inspecting your homes due to time constraints and the need to ensure that the Parks common property is properly addressed.  All Park buildings, the pool and the pool pump house have sustained damage from water intrusion that require cleaning or repair.\nIf  a neighbor or friend has not already contacted you about the condition of your home please contact the person that you have asked to maintain your home in your absence to inspect your property inside and out so that they can inform you of any damages. With this knowledge you will be able to have any cleanup or repair processes started.\nIt is your responsibility to maintain your home in good condition throughout the year and to be aware of its condition at all times. We also realize that this post Milton period is extraordinary and that repairs from hurricane damage may take time for many residents.\nOur thoughts are with all of our Ranch Mobile Friends and we will be back as strong as ever.\nThanks,\nRanch Mobile Board of Governors\n10/15/2024\nWe hope everyone is OK from Hurricanes Helene and Milton and that everyone was safe throughout the storm.\nThe office was flooded with minimum 12 inches of water.

As we work through the best way to maintain our pool, we have hired Artistic Pools to service our pool 3 days a week.\nArtistic Pools will service our pool on Mondays from 10AM to noon, Tuesdays from 8 to 9AM, and Thursdays from 8 to 9AM.  The pool will not be closed at these times unless Artistic Pools asks residents to vacate due to vacuuming or chemical treatments.  Artistic Pools will maintain the chemical balance of the pool water, the cleanliness of the pool itself, and the functioning of the equipment on these days.\nOn the other 4 days, Sunday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, our maintenance team will continue to maintain the pool as we have in the past.  The pool will be closed from 7AM until completion of the pool area maintenance procedures.\nWe will assess the effectiveness of this partnership with Artistic Pools as we go forward to reflect our future needs.\nThank you,\nYour Board of Governors\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n08/02/2023\nCOMPLAINTS:\nIf you have a complaint that you would like addressed by the Board, please put it in writing, sign it, and deliver it to the office.  The Board will then make you aware of the outcome and any necessary resolution.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n07/03/2023\nSEWER ISSUES\n:  There was a clog in the sewer line on Heron Rd. this weekend.  PLEASE DO NOT put fat, grease or ANY paper products in the sewer!  This causes headaches for the affected residents and costs the park money!\n________________________________________________________________________________\n05/22/2023\nSUSPECIOUS ACTIVITY:\nMost of our northerners have left for the summer.  The Ranch is empty.  Now is the time all the criminals come out from under their rocks.  Be on the lookout!  If you see anything suspicious,\nPLEASE CALL THE POLICE!\nYou can call the Largo Police non-emergency line (727-587-6730) or 911 in the case of an emergency.\n_______________________________________________\n04/05/2023\nResident Electrical Issue Procedures\nIf a resident is experiencing electrical issues such as no power, partial power, or lights flickering the following steps should be taken:\nCheck with a neighbor who is\nNOT\non your electrical pedestal to see if they are experiencing a power issue.\nCheck with a neighbor who is on the same electrical pedestal as you to see if they are experiencing a power issue.\nCall Duke Energy to have them check the power coming into your electrical pedestal if it is only you or those on your pedestal with issues or to report an area outage if neighbors not on your pedestal also have a power outage.\nIf the power to the pedestal is good, then a call should be made to an electrician.  Ranch Mobile recommends that you call Weather Chek Electric, Inc.  at 727-943-0886.  They are the park’s service provider for the electrical pedestals and they offer 24-hour service.  If you call Weather Chek, and if they find that the problem is with the electrical pedestal, they will let the Board know and make any repairs or replacements needed at the Park’s expense, including the service call charge.  If it is not the pedestal, but a resident issue with the pedestal breaker to the house, then Weather Check will let the resident know this.  If the issue is with the electrical system that is the resident’s responsibility, Weather Check will charge the resident for the service call and the resident can choose to have them also complete the repair or the resident can call another electrician at their expense.\nIf the resident chooses to first call an electrician, other than Weather Chek, the resident will be responsible for 100% of the service call expense and any repairs associated with the service call.\n**If you happen to have the Duke Energy insurance, ask that Weather Chek Electric, Inc be the provider sent to service your electrical issue.\n_______________________________________________\n03/06/2023\nPlease note that there is a Non-lessee requirement update:  All non-lessees 18 or older must provide a copy of their State ID or Driver’s License.\n_______________________________________________\n03/02/2023\nThou shalt not park on lawns, landscaped areas, or any other areas around your home.  Common roadway parking is allowed during the day and prohibited overnight.  So sayeth Part IV, Section 11(a) of the Ranch Mobile, Inc. Rules and Regulations.  This rule pertains to ALL Non-Recreational vehicles (autos, golf carts, bikes, etc.)\n_______________________________________________\n12/14/2022\nResidents who are experiencing sewer issues when flushing the toilet or have a back-up coming in through the floor drains should first call the office and if the office is closed for the day, call a Board member to have the park investigate first if it is a resident issue or a park main sewer line issue.\n_______________________________________________\n11/22/2022\nGreat information from the Largo Police Department.  Please read:\nOctober 2022 Speaker – Officer Bowling regarding Ranch Mobile’s Break-ins and calls to the Largo police.\nPrevention Measures:\nNeighbors – Get to know your neighbors and let them know when you will be gone so that they are aware and can call if they see something that looks unusual.\nOutside lighting – Have good lighting.  LED lights give better directional lighting and is very inexpensive to have on even for extended periods of time.  Focus lighting toward doors, windows, sheds and patios.  You do not need an electrician to wire up a security light.  They now have LED security lights that are run by solar power with motion detections capabilities for about $35.\nDeadbolts – If you have a window in the door, consider double tumbler so the window cannot be broken out to allow the deadbolt to be unlocked.  If you use a double tumbler, be sure to keep a key in the inside lock while you are home in case of a fire.  Remove the key when you will be away from home.  Change the striker plate screws to be 3 inch aluminum so it goes further into the wood frame so the door cannot be kicked in.\nSlider doors – Use any of these methods to lock out the door:  Broomstick in bottom frame, commercial door locks or a hole that you can place a pin (long nail) through to lock the two panels together.\nJalousie doors or windows – Replace them with solid doors or slider/double hung windows with locks.  Jalousie windows or doors are the easiest to break into because they only need to pry up the glass panel.\nDon’t advertise you are gone to those passing through your park.  No ropes across your driveway.  Do not tie up your mailbox or put a note in it reminding mailperson not to deliver to your home.\nAsk your neighbors or friends to park in your driveway once in a while to make it look like someone is living there.\nStart an evening routine – Pick a time after you know you will not be going out such as 9:00 P.M. to do a double check:\nif the shed and car doors are locked.  Actually pull the handles or turn the door knob.\nif the security lights are working properly and lighting the area that should be lit.\ngo back inside and lock all exterior doors.\nif you don’t have a motion detecting security light, turn on outside lights and leave on all night.  Use an LED bulb in your outside lights to have a brighter light and the cost to leave on will be minor.\nCar security – If you have a Kia or Hyundai where the key does not have a chip get something to lock out the steering wheel.  These vehicles are currently being targeted by thieves.\nNever\nleave the following in your car:  guns, keys to the car or home, valuables, purses, wallets, or personal information.  I recommend disengaging the automatic trunk lid pop so thieves cannot easily access the trunk if they break into the vehicle.\nFinally, the police are willing to come out to your home to give you a security audit and give you advice on how to better secure your home.  Call the non-emergency number (727-587-6730) and ask for Officer Bowling.\n_______________________________________________\n5/20/2022\nNEW DOORBELL\nat the office:  For safety reasons, there may be times during normal business hours (9 – 4, M – F) that the door is locked.  Please ring the doorbell and wait.  It may take us a minute or two to answer the door if we are busy with something else.\n_______________________________________________\n3/24/2022\nAs you are aware, on March 11, 2022 there was a major blockage in our sewer mains in the pet section.  Please,\nDO NOT\nput incontinence products of any kind, feminine hygiene products, wipes of any kind, grease and paper towels down drains or toilets.\n_______________________________________________\n01/24/2022\nWASTE PRO\nWe have a new trash pick-up company Waste Pro and a new bulk pick-up day, the last Saturday of the month, 1/29/2022 for January.\nACCEPTED ITEMS\n(for safety, please remove or secure any doors so they cannot be opened):\nFurniture\nBedsprings\nMattresses\nRugs\nLarge Toys\nTelevisions\nComputers\nYard Waste (3bundles of brush or branches no longer than 4 ft in length securely tied and weighing under 50 lbs.)\nGlass (50 lb. maximum, broken down, place in a closeable hard plastic box)\nNonmetal sinks, tubs and toilets\nSmall amount of remodeling debris (piles less than 4’x4’x8’ in size)\nMetal washers, dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers, sinks, stoves, and freezers\nIron furniture\nLawn mowers (all oil and gas needs to be removed prior to collection)\nDoors and cabinets\nBikes\nDisassembled swing sets\nAll oil, gas and liquids in general should be removed from items prior to collection\nUNACCEPTABLE ITEMS\n:\nConstruction and demolition Debris\nConcrete\nWood (from buildings)\nAsphalt (from roads and roofing shingles)\nGypsum (the main component of drywall)\nMetals (tires, tire rims, rebar)\nBricks\nGlass (sliding glass doors)\nTrees, stumps, earth, and rock from clearing sites\nContractor debris will not be collected\n_______________________________________________\n11/19/2021\nPlease do not feed the animals, especially around the lake!\n_______________________________________________\n9/27/2021\nAs a gentle reminder to returning residents, please make sure that maintenance, such as weeding, bush/tree trimming (excluding park trees), and power washing of homes/driveways, on the leaseholder property is completed as soon as possible upon  your return to the park.\n_______________________________________________\n4/14/2021\nGENTLE REMINDER\n– Please remember to inform the office if a resident passes away.  We like to lower the flag to half staff to honor them and provide notices.  The office may also have to deal with legal issues.  Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n_______________________________________________\nShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\n.entry-content\n.entry-footer\n#post-##\nMessage from the Board\n.entry-header\n8/4/2025\nUpdate on the Branch Creek Clean-up from the City of Largo\nDear Ranch Mobile Home Park Residents and Board Members,\nI hope this message finds you well.\nI’d like to provide a summary of the recent coordination and maintenance activities related to the drainage ditch along 150th Avenue in Largo, Florida.\nMeeting Summary:\nFDOT (Florida Department of Transportation):\nFDOT attended the site visit and confirmed that their section of the ditch remains within acceptable maintenance tolerances and is functioning as intended. Benjamin Smith of FDOT will provide a follow-up email with details regarding their herbicide spraying schedule and continued maintenance plans.\nFDOT’s contractor, Webber, has been tasked with providing a timeline for herbicide treatment and larger vegetation removal as part of their routine schedule. It was clarified that FDOT is not currently planning a full dredging or vegetation removal project, as existing conditions do not warrant it. FDOT and Webber will continue to monitor and respond to any blockages as needed.\nCity of Largo:\nAndre Frazier, Stormwater Supervisor for Open Conveyance Maintenance, attended the meeting and shared details about the City’s maintenance responsibilities and schedule. The city will continue to manage their portion of the ditch through routine inspections and vegetation control as necessary. In addition to standard maintenance, the City has also contracted aquatic spraying services to further manage vegetation and ensure proper flow within this section of the drainage system.\nPinellas County:\nI provided an overview of the County’s maintenance activities, which include slope mowing, aquatic spraying, and hand cleaning on a recurring 4–6-week cycle. I am in the process of confirming the exact schedule and will email that information to all attendees once finalized. Additionally, I’ve reached out to the hand cleaning crew to address some trash observed in the ditch during our visit.\nClosing Remarks:\nAll parties involved have agreed that the ditch is currently functioning as intended and that scheduled maintenance is being carried out appropriately. Agencies will continue to monitor and maintain their respective areas and coordinate as needed moving forward.\nIf any concerns arise regarding flow or obstruction in the ditch, please do not hesitate to report them so they can be addressed promptly.\nAndre Frazier  Stormwater Supervisor Public Works/Streets and Stormwater | City of Largo (727) 587-6740 x4304 | Afrazier@largo.com |\nLargo.com\nDisclaimer: According to Florida Public Records Law, email correspondence to and from the City of Largo, including email addresses and other personal information, is public record and must be made available to public and media upon request, unless otherwise exempt by the Public Records Law.\nUPDATE:  7/21/2025\n07/17/2025\nPLEASE NOTE NEW DATE!\nTHURSDAY, July 24, 2025\nWater Main Valves are being worked on\nBe prepared for intermittent water shut offs throughout the day\n07/11/2025 UPDATE ON LAKE RD CLOSURE\nThe intersection of Lake Rd. and 142nd Ave. is now open.\n07/08/2025, 3:35 PM WATER IS BACK ON!\n07/08/2025\nURGENT.

We are in the process of drying out files that were damaged by water.  One computer that was damaged has been repaired.   The furniture is being removed and will need to be replaced.  We have contacted contractors to remove the AC on top of the roof and to disconnect the power so that roofers can come and remove the remaining damaged metal roof and tarp the office roof.  The roof will need replacing. We have met with two contractors so far and hope to have bids by next week.  The timeline for roof replacement is undetermined until we receive bids and award the contract.  The paneling will need to be removed as it is buckling from being wet and to avoid mold to growth.  The office was the park facility damaged the most.   We hope to be able to open the office by the end of next week on a limited-service basis.  The repairs will take much longer.  We will keep you posted as we progress.\nIf someone is interested in buying or selling a home, they will need to contact the office through email for the time being:\nrranchmobile1@brighthouse.com\nNo home closings can occur until we have internet access restored.\nWe ask that unless it is an emergency or a key issue, you do not go to the office to allow this work to move as quickly as possible.\nTrash – Waste Pro is taking what they can, but please remember that the Monday and Thursday pick-up is for household trash.  The bulk pick-up is the last Saturday of the month, October 26.  Do not become upset if they do not take bulk items, construction debris or yard waste on a Monday or Thursday.  Truck space is limited, and the lines are very long at the landfills for disposal.  When it comes to bulk items, construction debris, or yard debris please keep the three categories separated.  Some additional reminders:\nCarpeting, even area rugs, should be 3 to 4 foot in length, rolled and tied.\nGlass or mirrors must be in a plastic bin, taped shut and marked as glass for the protection of the workers.\nConstruction debris must be removed by your contractor.\nIf you are doing the work yourself, the debris must be neatly organized so that it can be easily picked up.  Nails must be removed to avoid any injuries.  You are limited to the amount of construction debris allowed for bulk pick-up day.  Concrete, stones or bricks will not be taken. If you have a great deal, consider renting a dumpster.\nYard waste such as tree branches must be no longer than 3 to 4 feet and be tied and bundled.\nIf you have aluminum or metal items, the scrappers are in the park, let them know if you want them to take anything.  We believe some residents have posted names and numbers on Facebook of people who do this service.\nIf you are in doubt, please look at the website for trash pick-up procedures.\nPool facilities – The pool must be drained, cleaned, and refilled.  The filters can then be checked for any possible damage.  Artistic Pool has been hired to complete this task.  We are optimistic that the pool facilities will be available in approximately a month.  We are on a long list of communities needing this service.\nPalm Trees – Matthew’s will be in the park within the next week either removing or bracing damaged park palm trees.  Lawn mowing will be Tuesday, October 22.  They will mow lawns that they can access without debris.  They will also use the truck sweeper to clean the streets to remove as much of the washed-out materials as possible.\nThank you for your patience and assistance as we continue to work toward restoring our park facilities.\nRanch Mobile Board of Governors\n10/17/2024\nDear Residents of Ranch,\nHopefully this note finds you all safe.\nAfter the recent damaging hurricane Milton we would encourage each of you to proactively assess any damages you may have incurred at your mobile home.\nDue to the flooding in the Park many homes with a ground floor shed,  room or addition will have had water intrusion with subsequent water damage.\nThe board members will not be going around and inspecting your homes due to time constraints and the need to ensure that the Parks common property is properly addressed.  All Park buildings, the pool and the pool pump house have sustained damage from water intrusion that require cleaning or repair.\nIf  a neighbor or friend has not already contacted you about the condition of your home please contact the person that you have asked to maintain your home in your absence to inspect your property inside and out so that they can inform you of any damages. With this knowledge you will be able to have any cleanup or repair processes started.\nIt is your responsibility to maintain your home in good condition throughout the year and to be aware of its condition at all times.

PLEASE DO NOT put fat, grease or ANY paper products in the sewer!  This causes headaches for the affected residents and costs the park money!\n________________________________________________________________________________\n05/22/2023\nSUSPECIOUS ACTIVITY:\nMost of our northerners have left for the summer.  The Ranch is empty.  Now is the time all the criminals come out from under their rocks.  Be on the lookout!  If you see anything suspicious,\nPLEASE CALL THE POLICE!\nYou can call the Largo Police non-emergency line (727-587-6730) or 911 in the case of an emergency.\n_______________________________________________\n04/05/2023\nResident Electrical Issue Procedures\nIf a resident is experiencing electrical issues such as no power, partial power, or lights flickering the following steps should be taken:\nCheck with a neighbor who is\nNOT\non your electrical pedestal to see if they are experiencing a power issue.\nCheck with a neighbor who is on the same electrical pedestal as you to see if they are experiencing a power issue.\nCall Duke Energy to have them check the power coming into your electrical pedestal if it is only you or those on your pedestal with issues or to report an area outage if neighbors not on your pedestal also have a power outage.\nIf the power to the pedestal is good, then a call should be made to an electrician.  Ranch Mobile recommends that you call Weather Chek Electric, Inc.  at 727-943-0886.  They are the park’s service provider for the electrical pedestals and they offer 24-hour service.  If you call Weather Chek, and if they find that the problem is with the electrical pedestal, they will let the Board know and make any repairs or replacements needed at the Park’s expense, including the service call charge.  If it is not the pedestal, but a resident issue with the pedestal breaker to the house, then Weather Check will let the resident know this.  If the issue is with the electrical system that is the resident’s responsibility, Weather Check will charge the resident for the service call and the resident can choose to have them also complete the repair or the resident can call another electrician at their expense.\nIf the resident chooses to first call an electrician, other than Weather Chek, the resident will be responsible for 100% of the service call expense and any repairs associated with the service call.\n**If you happen to have the Duke Energy insurance, ask that Weather Chek Electric, Inc be the provider sent to service your electrical issue.\n_______________________________________________\n03/06/2023\nPlease note that there is a Non-lessee requirement update:  All non-lessees 18 or older must provide a copy of their State ID or Driver’s License.\n_______________________________________________\n03/02/2023\nThou shalt not park on lawns, landscaped areas, or any other areas around your home.  Common roadway parking is allowed during the day and prohibited overnight.  So sayeth Part IV, Section 11(a) of the Ranch Mobile, Inc. Rules and Regulations.  This rule pertains to ALL Non-Recreational vehicles (autos, golf carts, bikes, etc.)\n_______________________________________________\n12/14/2022\nResidents who are experiencing sewer issues when flushing the toilet or have a back-up coming in through the floor drains should first call the office and if the office is closed for the day, call a Board member to have the park investigate first if it is a resident issue or a park main sewer line issue.\n_______________________________________________\n11/22/2022\nGreat information from the Largo Police Department.  Please read:\nOctober 2022 Speaker – Officer Bowling regarding Ranch Mobile’s Break-ins and calls to the Largo police.\nPrevention Measures:\nNeighbors – Get to know your neighbors and let them know when you will be gone so that they are aware and can call if they see something that looks unusual.\nOutside lighting – Have good lighting.  LED lights give better directional lighting and is very inexpensive to have on even for extended periods of time.  Focus lighting toward doors, windows, sheds and patios.  You do not need an electrician to wire up a security light.  They now have LED security lights that are run by solar power with motion detections capabilities for about $35.\nDeadbolts – If you have a window in the door, consider double tumbler so the window cannot be broken out to allow the deadbolt to be unlocked.  If you use a double tumbler, be sure to keep a key in the inside lock while you are home in case of a fire.  Remove the key when you will be away from home.  Change the striker plate screws to be 3 inch aluminum so it goes further into the wood frame so the door cannot be kicked in.\nSlider doors – Use any of these methods to lock out the door:  Broomstick in bottom frame, commercial door locks or a hole that you can place a pin (long nail) through to lock the two panels together.\nJalousie doors or windows – Replace them with solid doors or slider/double hung windows with locks.  Jalousie windows or doors are the easiest to break into because they only need to pry up the glass panel.\nDon’t advertise you are gone to those passing through your park.  No ropes across your driveway.  Do not tie up your mailbox or put a note in it reminding mailperson not to deliver to your home.\nAsk your neighbors or friends to park in your driveway once in a while to make it look like someone is living there.\nStart an evening routine – Pick a time after you know you will not be going out such as 9:00 P.M. to do a double check:\nif the shed and car doors are locked.  Actually pull the handles or turn the door knob.\nif the security lights are working properly and lighting the area that should be lit.\ngo back inside and lock all exterior doors.\nif you don’t have a motion detecting security light, turn on outside lights and leave on all night.  Use an LED bulb in your outside lights to have a brighter light and the cost to leave on will be minor.\nCar security – If you have a Kia or Hyundai where the key does not have a chip get something to lock out the steering wheel.  These vehicles are currently being targeted by thieves.\nNever\nleave the following in your car:  guns, keys to the car or home, valuables, purses, wallets, or personal information.  I recommend disengaging the automatic trunk lid pop so thieves cannot easily access the trunk if they break into the vehicle.\nFinally, the police are willing to come out to your home to give you a security audit and give you advice on how to better secure your home.  Call the non-emergency number (727-587-6730) and ask for Officer Bowling.\n_______________________________________________\n5/20/2022\nNEW DOORBELL\nat the office:  For safety reasons, there may be times during normal business hours (9 – 4, M – F) that the door is locked.  Please ring the doorbell and wait.  It may take us a minute or two to answer the door if we are busy with something else.\n_______________________________________________\n3/24/2022\nAs you are aware, on March 11, 2022 there was a major blockage in our sewer mains in the pet section.  Please,\nDO NOT\nput incontinence products of any kind, feminine hygiene products, wipes of any kind, grease and paper towels down drains or toilets.\n_______________________________________________\n01/24/2022\nWASTE PRO\nWe have a new trash pick-up company Waste Pro and a new bulk pick-up day, the last Saturday of the month, 1/29/2022 for January.\nACCEPTED ITEMS\n(for safety, please remove or secure any doors so they cannot be opened):\nFurniture\nBedsprings\nMattresses\nRugs\nLarge Toys\nTelevisions\nComputers\nYard Waste (3bundles of brush or branches no longer than 4 ft in length securely tied and weighing under 50 lbs.)\nGlass (50 lb. maximum, broken down, place in a closeable hard plastic box)\nNonmetal sinks, tubs and toilets\nSmall amount of remodeling debris (piles less than 4’x4’x8’ in size)\nMetal washers, dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers, sinks, stoves, and freezers\nIron furniture\nLawn mowers (all oil and gas needs to be removed prior to collection)\nDoors and cabinets\nBikes\nDisassembled swing sets\nAll oil, gas and liquids in general should be removed from items prior to collection\nUNACCEPTABLE ITEMS\n:\nConstruction and demolition Debris\nConcrete\nWood (from buildings)\nAsphalt (from roads and roofing shingles)\nGypsum (the main component of drywall)\nMetals (tires, tire rims, rebar)\nBricks\nGlass (sliding glass doors)\nTrees, stumps, earth, and rock from clearing sites\nContractor debris will not be collected\n_______________________________________________\n11/19/2021\nPlease do not feed the animals, especially around the lake!\n_______________________________________________\n9/27/2021\nAs a gentle reminder to returning residents, please make sure that maintenance, such as weeding, bush/tree trimming (excluding park trees), and power washing of homes/driveways, on the leaseholder property is completed as soon as possible upon  your return to the park.\n_______________________________________________\n4/14/2021\nGENTLE REMINDER\n– Please remember to inform the office if a resident passes away.  We like to lower the flag to half staff to honor them and provide notices.  The office may also have to deal with legal issues.  Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n_______________________________________________\nShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\n.entry-content\n.entry-footer",
