Scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026, the Windsor Charity Polo Cup is recognized as the signature high-goal charity polo match of the Vero Beach season. Since its inception in 2012, the event has raised more than $2 million for local and national nonprofit organizations.\n“Polo has long been a cornerstone of Windsor’s culture, reflecting our community’s deep appreciation for sport and tradition,” says Max Secunda, Windsor’s director of equestrian operations and the event’s match director. “We are proud to once again host the highly anticipated Windsor Charity Polo Cup, and to be supporting three outstanding local charitable organizations.”\nSelected by the Windsor membership, the beneficiaries for the 2026 event are Childcare Resources of Indian River, Crossover Mission and the Environmental Learning Center. All three charities selected offer programs to support the basic, educational and enrichment needs of underprivileged children, including community education on the importance of land preservation. While the Polo Cup raised $350,000 in 2022 and $400,000 in 2024, in 2026, the Windsor Foundation aims to significantly surpass its previous fundraising efforts.\n“PNC is proud to continue our support of the Windsor Charity Polo Cup and its mission to create lasting change in the Vero Beach community,” said Cressman Bronson, PNC regional president for Southeast Florida. “This event enables us to contribute to organizations that protect our environment and empower the people who call it home.”\nIn addition to the thrill of world-class polo, the 2026 Windsor Charity Polo Cup will feature an array of interactive events and exhibitions for the entire family to enjoy. Highlights include an elegant fieldside luncheon for 650 guests, junior player match, themed tailgate competition, luxury automobile concours, and an exciting silent auction and raffle.\nCorporate and luxury sponsors are quickly signing up, joining Windsor members who are generously supporting the event.

Stretching along the Indian River Lagoon, the North Village will pay tribute to the existing homes on property while placing a heightened emphasis on sustainability and fostering a vibrant, enduring environment for years to come.\nTickets go on sale to the public Sept. 2, 2025.

In Vero Beach they became enchanted by a property that over the next decades would become a cherished home, passion project and ultimately a critically acclaimed residential community. Windsor was designed by renowned town planners Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk in the New Urbanism style of residential living. It offers public and community spaces framed by timeless architecture and landscape design that celebrates its tropical and unspoiled setting.
