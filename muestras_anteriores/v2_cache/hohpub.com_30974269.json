We hope you enjoy the friendly atmosphere here at Florida’s most authentic Irish pub. However, any establishment is merely bricks and mortar without the people that create the atmosphere. The HOH is blessed with the finest staff. So belly on up to the bar, grab a stool, order a pint (or your preference) and experience some Irish hospitality. Thank you for the privilege of serving you.\nWe feature a quick and satisfying lunch including daily specials. Stop by after work for one of the best happy hours in town.\nGood people drink good beer.\nHunter S.
