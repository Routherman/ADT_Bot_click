      "text": "Our Story\nBay 13 Brewery & Kitchen was conceived by two recovering accountants turned hospitality entrepreneurs, aimed at showcasing Melbournian hospitality. Bay 13 is focused on a deliberate and comfortable environment serving quality beer, and quality food with friendly, professional service in a relaxed atmosphere. With the addition of a very deliberate, high-quality, and beer-focused menu, we are aiming to bring something truly unique to the South Florida beer market.\nThe beer menu is fresh and will change regularly showcasing a global offering of beer styles, of course including some great Southern Hemisphere style beers.\nOur Team\nNick Sharp - Owner\nNick came to Miami in 2012 as an accountant at a dairy commodity trading company. In 2014 with his wife Teresa, opened Threefold Café on Giralda Avenue in the Gables aiming to recreate a small piece of their hometown of Melbourne, which is so heavily served with great coffee and all-day breakfast.\nSince that time Nick has undertaken a variety of ventures in Miami from Miami Beach to Key Biscayne but his home is definitely Coral Gables where he has four operating locations. Nick is an active member in the community serving on the Executive Board of the Coral Gables Business improvement district as well as a variety of other panels, committees, and task forces.\nGreg Berbusse - Head Brewer\nHailing from Little Rock, AR Greg was recruited to Bay 13 Brewery and Kitchen at the end of 2019, moving down early in the near year of 2020. If Miami wasn’t a large enough shock to the system, the first port of call was being shipped off to Australia to do a 10-day whirlwind brewery tour of Sydney, Canberra, and Melbourne.  Back to Bay 13 to oversee the final (and long) stages of the construction process, Greg was finally able to begin brewing in November for the December grand opening. The starting range was a huge hit with the most common comment being “a menu with beer-flavored beer”!\nGet in touch\nName\n*\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\n*\nMessage\n*\nSubject\nGeneral Inquiries\nMedia Inquiries\nOther\nThank you!\nOur Story\nBay 13 Brewery & Kitchen was conceived by two recovering accountants turned hospitality entrepreneurs, aimed at showcasing Melbournian hospitality.
