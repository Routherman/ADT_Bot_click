This family trio is best known for their sweet harmonies and well-crafted songs—each a blend of folk, bluegrass, and rock. They rose to popularity shortly after the release of their debut full-length album, Superhighway, and have since become regular headliners at Americana, jam, and folk festivals across the South. With instinctive vocals and stripped-down instrumentation, The New 76ers often stand around a single microphone and deliver timeless, soul-stirring music in it's purest form. Passionate performers and festival favorites, their mission is to share love through music—and they believe that music is, and always will be, a force to inspire change. Real music. Real people.

Listening to the breadth of his discography, which includes 7 projects as a solo artist and 6 as a founding member of the string band, Hawktail, one will hear this dedication at play. Equally virtuosic as a flatpicker and fingerstylist, and with a casual vocal style, Tice conjures ingredients from far-flung worlds with ease which has earned him glowing press from such outlets as NPR and American Songwriter and taken him to stages such as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the Ryman Auditorium. His performances call upon the repertories of American and British Isles folk, bluegrass, blues and pop-oriented songs, and though his earlier releases are instrumental in focus, he has been carefully honing his craft as a singer-songwriter in his most recent work. Having filled the roles of guitar ace, sideman (w/ Aoife O’Donovan, Andrew Marlin of Watchhouse and David Rawlings), songwriter and student of American music for the better part of his life, Jordan’s songs are enriching for all manner of listeners, from guitar fanatics to more casual fans of Americana music.

He blended music with dialogue and storytelling to captivate any audience he came before.\nGamble inspired many artists, including Jimmy Buffet, to expand their capacity for storytelling and their musical talent will follow. Gamble first gained national attention as a lead singer and guitarist, both acoustic and electric, for the band the Serendipity Singers.\n​\nHe introduced and verbally set the stage for their songs when they appeared on television shows such as The Tonight Show, Hootenanny, and The Ed Sullivan Show. Gamble soon moved to a solo career where he earned national acclaim, appearing on talk shows across the country, hosting numerous music specials, and continuing to play his whimsical, spellbinding music. At the age of 54, Gamble passed away trying to save a drowning man at Flagler Beach in Florida. He is remembered today through the Gamble Rogers Memorial Foundation and the Gamble Rogers Folk Fest.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nGamble Rogers balanced a love of balladry and folk songs with a passion for the oral tradition and storytelling. The son and grandson of influential architects, Rogers was described as both a \"modern troubadour\" and the \"resurrection of Will Rogers and Mark Twain\". Rogers was a master performer--enchanting an audience with Travis-style guitar finger picking and relating downright rib-tickling tales about the inhabitants of the fictitious Oklawaha County.\nThe Atlanta Constitution called Rogers, \"an American treasure worthy of inclusion in the Smithsonian\". Rogers was just hitting his peak when he died, on October 10, 1991, trying to save a man from drowning. The recreational area in Flagler County, where the accident occurred, was later renamed, Gamble Rogers Memorial State Recreation Area.\nIn the liner notes of his album, Fruitcakes, Jimmy Buffett dedicated the recording to Rogers' memory and wrote that Rogers, \"taught me how to move an audience with dialogue and delivery as much as with music\". In 1993, Rogers was posthumously awarded a Folk Heritage award.\n~ Craig Harris, All Music Guide\n﻿\n/$\n$\nREAD MORE\n/$\n$\nWhy do we celebrate Gamble’s legacy?
