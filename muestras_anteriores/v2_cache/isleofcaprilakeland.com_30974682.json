He works alongside his wife, and says she is a large part of what makes the bar run well. Lauzon says the longevity at the Isle of Capri is due to the great customers. When not working, Lauzon likes to relax at home with his wife and 16-year-old son. Lauzon moved to Florida from Massachusetts 30 years ago to follow his older brother.\"\n-- Jennifer Canady/Ledger Correspondent\nclick here to read the article\nThis is an article about Christy Published in the Lakeland ledger: Thursday, June 15, 2006\nAfter 25 years as a bartender -- the last 20 at Isle of Capri off Combee Road in Lakeland -- Christy Lauzon has figured out the key qualities any good bartender must possess: the ability to juggle a million things at once and a personality. Lauzon -- as demonstrated as she grilled hamburgers, poured beer and made small talk with her customers on a recent afternoon -- has both. \"Women are good jugglers. We take care of the kids, the home, the husbands -- they're just like babies -- but they don't have us as president.\"\n-- Rachel Pleasant/The Ledger\nclick here to read the article\nHello Everyone,\nI am writing this to introduce you to the Isle Of Capri.
