Originally from Orlando, Zachariah brings over a decade of restaurant experience to his leadership role. He began his career at Olive Garden in 2011 as a line cook and steadily advanced through both back-of-house and front-of-house positions, eventually becoming a Culinary Manager in 2019. He played a key role in opening the Olive Garden in Champions Gate and went on to serve as General Manager in Brunswick, GA before joining FMK.\n​\nSince coming onboard with FMK seven months ago, Zachariah has worked at Chop House at Lake Sumter and started as a Bar Manager before advancing to General Manager at Bonifay. He’s passionate about serving The Villages community and finds great fulfillment in mentoring and growing his team. Outside of work, Zachariah is a dedicated husband and father of two. He also enjoys playing video games as a way to relax and recharge.\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nGary Moore\n/$\n$\nCULINARY MANAGER\n/$\n$\nGary Moore is the Culinary Manager at Bonifay Country Club in The Villages, FL, bringing over 14 years of restaurant industry experience to FMK Hospitality Group. Originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Gary developed his love for cooking early in life as an only child with working parents. That passion led him to earn an associate degree from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Tucker, GA, in 2013, with externships at prestigious Atlanta restaurants like Ray's in the City and Fox Bros. BBQ. Since joining FMK over two years ago as a Line Cook, Gary has contributed to multiple venues including Evans Prairie Country Club, Belle Glade Country Club, and was instrumental in opening Sawgrass Tavern.\n​\nGary thrives in FMK’s unique “each one teach one” culture, describing the company as a rare gem in the hospitality industry where growth, opportunity, and mentorship are priorities. He takes pride in mentoring others while continuing to grow his own culinary talents. His favorite entrée at Bonifay is the pecan-encrusted salmon. Outside of the kitchen, Gary is a dedicated family man, married to his wife Tamika for 8 years, and father to three grown children—two firefighters and a nursing assistant. He’s also an avid motorcyclist and dog dad to Bear, Bosco, and Butchie.\n/$\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\nOUR TEAM\n/$\n$\nOur team is managed by Zachariah Berndt, General Manager and Gary Moore, Culinary Manager\n/$\n$\nJOIN OUR TEAM TODAY\n/$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\n$\nZachariah Berndt\n/$\n$\nGENERAL MANAGER\n/$\n$\nZachariah Berndt is the General Manager at Bonifay Country Club, part of FMK Hospitality Group in The Villages, FL.
