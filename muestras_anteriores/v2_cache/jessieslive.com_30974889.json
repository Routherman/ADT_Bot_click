Many people might be surprised to learn that Jessie is a young, female, business savvy entrepreneur from Winter Haven. She is civic minded and has established a reputation for her willingness to be involved in community affairs. She was born into the hospitality industry with her grandparents and parents leading the way. After working in the business she set out to establish her own place. Jessie Skubna and her business partners Steve and Mary Jensen (her Mother) invested in the downtown area of Winter Haven before it became the popular place to be.\nUltimately they were able to purchase the entire building. In December of 2015 they opened “Jensen’s Corner Bar” named for her parents and partners, this bar is a non-smoking venue offering a good selection of wine and craft beers on tap.\nThe back patio expands the space and features an original wall mural of a big bass guitar. “Goldie” was painted by Mark Hanna to honor musician Ralph Ameduri. Jessie has always supported both musicians and artists. She has an extensive collection of artwork displayed in both Jessie’s and Jensen’s. She has brought nationally known musical acts to the area.\nBoth bars are available for events, parties and special occasions. They are connected by a walkway from one patio to the other giving people the opportunity to mingle and enjoy two completely different atmospheres.\nAbout us\nJessie’s Lounge opened September 16th, 2002 located at 118 3rd St SW, Originally the site of the 3rd Street Pub and Cinema.
