      "text": "Home\nAbout the CDD\nCommunity Development District Overview\nThe Grand Haven Community Development District (the “District”) is an independent local unit of, special-purpose government, created pursuant to and existing under the provisions of Chapter 190, Florida Statutes. The District was established by Ordinance 97-03 adopted of the Board of County Commissioners of Flagler County, Florida which became effective on March 3rd, 1997.\nThe District currently encompasses approximately nine hundred and ninety-seven (997.82) acres of land located entirely within Flagler County, Florida. As a local unit of special-purpose government, the District provides an alternative means for planning, financing, constructing, operating and maintaining various public improvements and community facilities within its jurisdiction.\nA District provides the “solution” to Florida’s need to provide valuable community infrastructure generated by growth, ultimately without overburdening other governments and their taxpaying residents. Community Development Districts represent a major advancement in Florida’s effort to manage its growth effectively and efficiently. This allows a community to establish higher construction standards, meanwhile providing a long-term solution to the operation and maintenance of the community’s facilities.\nDistrict Map\nCommunity Development District Organization\nThe Grand Haven Community Development District (the “District”) is organized similar to other local governments in Florida, in that the legislative body is composed of a five-member board known as the Board of Supervisors. The Board establishes the policy of the District in accordance with Florida law. The Board, by law, must hire a District Manager and District Counsel. Staff members operate utilizing the same formalities as a County Administrator and County Attorney. The Board, through review of advertised Requests for Qualifications, ranks and selects a District Engineer to perform the engineering needs of the District. The District staff administers the operations of the District and implements the Board’s policies and contracts.\nDistrict Administration\nThe District Manager’s responsibilities include:\nPreparation and submittal of a proposed operations and maintenance budgets for Board of Supervisors review and action.\nPreparation of contract specifications for District operations, including community appearance, waterway management, street lighting and facilities maintenance.\nFile all required forms and documents with state and local agencies.\nAttend all Board of Supervisor meetings.\nImplement the policies of the Board of Supervisors.\nAdditional duties as directed by the Board of Supervisors.\n./about-the-cdd\nAbout the CDD\n./amenities\nAmenities\n./finances\nFinances\n./elections\nElections\n./meetings\nMeetings\n./questions\nQuestions\n./services\nServices\n./website-accessibility\nWebsite Accessibility\nAcrobat Reader DC Link\nThis site provides information using PDF, visit this link to\ndownload the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC software\n.\nVesta District Services\n250 International Parkway\nSuite 208\nLake Mary, FL 32746\nCorporate Office\nDavid McInnes\nDistrict Manager\nQuick Links\nHome\nAbout\nDocuments\nFAQs\nCalendar\nContact Us\nAccessibility Policy\nIf you have a concern, please let us know.\nUse this form to report your concern.",
