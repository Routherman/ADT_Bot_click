From its earliest founding, artist Jacques LeMoyne was sent by the French king to document images of the New World. In the early 1800s, John James Audubon trod the wilds of North Florida classifying and painting the abundant wildlife. At the turn of the century, oil tycoon Henry Flagler enticed artists from New England to paint in his opulent Hotel Ponce de Leon studios for the enjoyment of his wealthy patrons.\nEst. January 18, 1924\nThe St. Augustine Art Association emerged as part of local art history in 1924, when Nina Hawkins, the first female editor of The St. Augustine Record, gathered together wintering artists and writers to form The Pen & Brush Club, which soon became “The Galleon Club.”\nMiss Hawkins continued over the years to promote this St. Augustine group of artists through the local newspaper. Other charter members included photographer F. Victor Rahner, writers John and Georjina Jex, and painter John Parker. The\nGalleon Club\nwent through several fits and starts over the next few years, until in 1931, Hildegarde Mueller-Uri and J. Dexter Phinney organized the Club with the intent to transform St. Augustine into a major winter art colony. They persuaded the City of St. Augustine to allow them to use the former Waterworks building in Davenport Park as a clubhouse and exhibition gallery.\nWhen the Great Depression gripped the local economy, it was the successful ad campaign “Like Painting in Europe” launched by the artists and local businesses that drew flocks of artists to the Oldest City. The 1930’s and 40’s saw prominent artists moving to St. Augustine from up north like Nunzio Vayana, Edith Oliver, Louis Vogt, Bill Galpin, Tod Lindenmuth and his wife E.B. Warren, Anthony Thieme, Langston Moffett, and William and Lucy L’Engle.\nIn 1948, the club officially changed its name to the St. Augustine Art Association (STAAA). Membership was at an all-time high–over 500 members–and after moving around from one location to another over the years, it was time for the Art Association to build its own space. The land on Marine Street had been purchased by the organization in 1945 from Hildegarde Mueller-Uri’s parents and the building–what is now the main gallery–opened in February 1954.\nThrough the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, the STAAA continued to grow and expand exhibits, memberships and programs. It was incorporated as a non-profit and bylaws amended so that the property will always remain devoted to public charities with a preference for the arts. Despite some financial woes, the members and board directors were creative and held fundraisers like the Art-Mart, Beaux Arts Balls, workshops, concerts and performances. In 1998, thanks to funds donated by Joseph & Faith Tiberio, the building was expanded by the addition of the two wing galleries, allowing for more growth and space. In that same year a new source of funding became available, “The St. Augustine Art & Craft Festival.”\nToday, St. Augustine is home to many art galleries and artists, ranging from amateurs and students to internationally acclaimed professionals. With its extensive Permanent Collection of important St. Augustine art, large active membership and ever-expanding exhibitions, programs and partnerships, the STAAA thrives and is recognized as the cultural epicenter of the local art community.\nOn January 18, 1924, a handful of visionaries in St. Augustine, Florida, founded an art group that over time grew into a vibrant and influential force for the arts–the St. Augustine Art Association. This video features historian Susan Parker and two distinguished Art Association members, Tom Rahner and Kay Burtin. Their stories highlight the history of the founding of the St. Augustine Art Association. The project was produced for the Association’s 95th Anniversary in 2019, through a grant from The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida.\nThis symposium brought to life the people and personalities of St. Augustine’s mid-century art colony. The gathering featured local artists, historians and residents whose research, recollections and first-hand knowledge that shed light on the importance of this regional art movement. A figurative art exhibit with newly acquired and restored portraits complimented the discussion.\nThursday, April 7, 2011\nListen to the Symposium\n.entry-content\nABOUT THE ST.

After four and a half years of working in communications, she walked into the St. Augustine Art Association in 2016, and never left. Jennifer oversees all facets of the Art Association including the exhibitions, programs and Permanent Collection.\n\nIn her spare time, she enjoys little adventures with her dog Loki, kayaking and gardening. Jennifer can also be found frequently eating around the world at Epcot.\nBailey Poole, Program Director\nWith a background in museum studies and art history, Bailey first became involved with the St. Augustine Art Association as a curatorial intern from Flagler College in 2017. Having the opportunity to spearhead an exhibit centered around locally-renowned artist, Emmett Fritz, solidified her career interests: combining an appreciation for art with a passion for people. Less than a year later, she officially joined the staff and made a new home here at the Art Association. Now, not only does she organize an ongoing rotation of workshops and educational programming, Bailey also coordinates all of the volunteers, manages memberships, and helps oversee the day to day functions of the gallery.\nWhen not at the gallery, Bailey spends her spare time pursuing her own artistic hobbies -- if she’s not chasing after her dog Scooby or binging the latest TV series, of course!\nMorgan Zoldak, Gallery Assistant\nRaised in St. Johns County, Morgan has always been drawn to the charm of St. Augustine—especially its history and beautiful architecture. She earned her B.A. in Art History and Economics from Florida State University before moving to New York, where she pursued an M.A. in Art Market Studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Over the past six years, Morgan has immersed herself in New York City's arts scene, working across various creative spaces such as galleries and art fairs. Last spring, she returned to St. Johns County and had a full-circle moment upon reconnecting with the St. Augustine Art Association—an organization where she once exhibited her ceramics as a high school student. Beyond the gallery, Morgan is a passionate educator who teaches chess to children, a friendly barista who can craft your favorite cup of coffee without fail, and a yoga enthusiast striving to perfect her shoulder stand someday soon!\nCatherine Avery St. Jean, President of the Board of Directors\nCatherine was born in Iowa, earned her BA in Communications from Loyola University in Chicago and then started a career in Advertising that took her to Madison Avenue. Catherine and her husband relocated to St. Augustine, Florida, arriving on New Year's Day in 2012. She joined the St. Augustine Art Association in 2014 and, by 2015, became actively involved as Chair of Receiving for exhibitions and became a Life Member.

After four and a half years of working in communications, she walked into the St. Augustine Art Association in 2016, and never left. Jennifer oversees all facets of the Art Association including the exhibitions, programs and Permanent Collection.\n\nIn her spare time, she enjoys little adventures with her dog Loki, kayaking and gardening. Jennifer can also be found frequently eating around the world at Epcot.\nBailey Poole, Program Director\nWith a background in museum studies and art history, Bailey first became involved with the St. Augustine Art Association as a curatorial intern from Flagler College in 2017. Having the opportunity to spearhead an exhibit centered around locally-renowned artist, Emmett Fritz, solidified her career interests: combining an appreciation for art with a passion for people. Less than a year later, she officially joined the staff and made a new home here at the Art Association. Now, not only does she organize an ongoing rotation of workshops and educational programming, Bailey also coordinates all of the volunteers, manages memberships, and helps oversee the day to day functions of the gallery.\nWhen not at the gallery, Bailey spends her spare time pursuing her own artistic hobbies -- if she’s not chasing after her dog Scooby or binging the latest TV series, of course!\nMorgan Zoldak, Gallery Assistant\nRaised in St. Johns County, Morgan has always been drawn to the charm of St. Augustine—especially its history and beautiful architecture. She earned her B.A. in Art History and Economics from Florida State University before moving to New York, where she pursued an M.A. in Art Market Studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Over the past six years, Morgan has immersed herself in New York City's arts scene, working across various creative spaces such as galleries and art fairs. Last spring, she returned to St. Johns County and had a full-circle moment upon reconnecting with the St. Augustine Art Association—an organization where she once exhibited her ceramics as a high school student. Beyond the gallery, Morgan is a passionate educator who teaches chess to children, a friendly barista who can craft your favorite cup of coffee without fail, and a yoga enthusiast striving to perfect her shoulder stand someday soon!\nCatherine Avery St. Jean, President of the Board of Directors\nCatherine was born in Iowa, earned her BA in Communications from Loyola University in Chicago and then started a career in Advertising that took her to Madison Avenue. Catherine and her husband relocated to St. Augustine, Florida, arriving on New Year's Day in 2012. She joined the St. Augustine Art Association in 2014 and, by 2015, became actively involved as Chair of Receiving for exhibitions and became a Life Member. In 2017, she helped relaunch the Plein Air Paint Out, transforming it into a celebrated event for artists and art enthusiasts. In 2022, she joined the Board of Directors. Additionally, Catherine dedicated eight years to the St. Johns County Library Advisory Board, where she championed library initiatives to better serve the community.

From its earliest founding, artist Jacques LeMoyne was sent by the French king to document images of the New World. In the early 1800s, John James Audubon trod the wilds of North Florida classifying and painting the abundant wildlife. At the turn of the century, oil tycoon Henry Flagler enticed artists from New England to paint in his opulent Hotel Ponce de Leon studios for the enjoyment of his wealthy patrons.\nEst. January 18, 1924\nThe St. Augustine Art Association emerged as part of local art history in 1924, when Nina Hawkins, the first female editor of The St. Augustine Record, gathered together wintering artists and writers to form The Pen & Brush Club, which soon became “The Galleon Club.”\nMiss Hawkins continued over the years to promote this St. Augustine group of artists through the local newspaper. Other charter members included photographer F. Victor Rahner, writers John and Georjina Jex, and painter John Parker. The\nGalleon Club\nwent through several fits and starts over the next few years, until in 1931, Hildegarde Mueller-Uri and J. Dexter Phinney organized the Club with the intent to transform St. Augustine into a major winter art colony. They persuaded the City of St. Augustine to allow them to use the former Waterworks building in Davenport Park as a clubhouse and exhibition gallery.\nWhen the Great Depression gripped the local economy, it was the successful ad campaign “Like Painting in Europe” launched by the artists and local businesses that drew flocks of artists to the Oldest City. The 1930’s and 40’s saw prominent artists moving to St. Augustine from up north like Nunzio Vayana, Edith Oliver, Louis Vogt, Bill Galpin, Tod Lindenmuth and his wife E.B. Warren, Anthony Thieme, Langston Moffett, and William and Lucy L’Engle.\nIn 1948, the club officially changed its name to the St. Augustine Art Association (STAAA). Membership was at an all-time high–over 500 members–and after moving around from one location to another over the years, it was time for the Art Association to build its own space. The land on Marine Street had been purchased by the organization in 1945 from Hildegarde Mueller-Uri’s parents and the building–what is now the main gallery–opened in February 1954.\nThrough the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, the STAAA continued to grow and expand exhibits, memberships and programs. It was incorporated as a non-profit and bylaws amended so that the property will always remain devoted to public charities with a preference for the arts. Despite some financial woes, the members and board directors were creative and held fundraisers like the Art-Mart, Beaux Arts Balls, workshops, concerts and performances. In 1998, thanks to funds donated by Joseph & Faith Tiberio, the building was expanded by the addition of the two wing galleries, allowing for more growth and space. In that same year a new source of funding became available, “The St. Augustine Art & Craft Festival.”\nToday, St. Augustine is home to many art galleries and artists, ranging from amateurs and students to internationally acclaimed professionals. With its extensive Permanent Collection of important St. Augustine art, large active membership and ever-expanding exhibitions, programs and partnerships, the STAAA thrives and is recognized as the cultural epicenter of the local art community.\nOn January 18, 1924, a handful of visionaries in St. Augustine, Florida, founded an art group that over time grew into a vibrant and influential force for the arts–the St. Augustine Art Association. This video features historian Susan Parker and two distinguished Art Association members, Tom Rahner and Kay Burtin. Their stories highlight the history of the founding of the St. Augustine Art Association. The project was produced for the Association’s 95th Anniversary in 2019, through a grant from The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida.\nThis symposium brought to life the people and personalities of St. Augustine’s mid-century art colony. The gathering featured local artists, historians and residents whose research, recollections and first-hand knowledge that shed light on the importance of this regional art movement.

After four and a half years of working in communications, she walked into the St. Augustine Art Association in 2016, and never left. Jennifer oversees all facets of the Art Association including the exhibitions, programs and Permanent Collection.\n\nIn her spare time, she enjoys little adventures with her dog Loki, kayaking and gardening. Jennifer can also be found frequently eating around the world at Epcot.\nBailey Poole, Program Director\nWith a background in museum studies and art history, Bailey first became involved with the St. Augustine Art Association as a curatorial intern from Flagler College in 2017. Having the opportunity to spearhead an exhibit centered around locally-renowned artist, Emmett Fritz, solidified her career interests: combining an appreciation for art with a passion for people. Less than a year later, she officially joined the staff and made a new home here at the Art Association. Now, not only does she organize an ongoing rotation of workshops and educational programming, Bailey also coordinates all of the volunteers, manages memberships, and helps oversee the day to day functions of the gallery.\nWhen not at the gallery, Bailey spends her spare time pursuing her own artistic hobbies -- if she’s not chasing after her dog Scooby or binging the latest TV series, of course!\nMorgan Zoldak, Gallery Assistant\nRaised in St. Johns County, Morgan has always been drawn to the charm of St. Augustine—especially its history and beautiful architecture. She earned her B.A. in Art History and Economics from Florida State University before moving to New York, where she pursued an M.A. in Art Market Studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Over the past six years, Morgan has immersed herself in New York City's arts scene, working across various creative spaces such as galleries and art fairs. Last spring, she returned to St. Johns County and had a full-circle moment upon reconnecting with the St. Augustine Art Association—an organization where she once exhibited her ceramics as a high school student. Beyond the gallery, Morgan is a passionate educator who teaches chess to children, a friendly barista who can craft your favorite cup of coffee without fail, and a yoga enthusiast striving to perfect her shoulder stand someday soon!\nCatherine Avery St. Jean, President of the Board of Directors\nCatherine was born in Iowa, earned her BA in Communications from Loyola University in Chicago and then started a career in Advertising that took her to Madison Avenue. Catherine and her husband relocated to St. Augustine, Florida, arriving on New Year's Day in 2012. She joined the St. Augustine Art Association in 2014 and, by 2015, became actively involved as Chair of Receiving for exhibitions and became a Life Member. In 2017, she helped relaunch the Plein Air Paint Out, transforming it into a celebrated event for artists and art enthusiasts. In 2022, she joined the Board of Directors. Additionally, Catherine dedicated eight years to the St. Johns County Library Advisory Board, where she championed library initiatives to better serve the community.

No matter the outcome, we continue to develop our aesthetic vision and craftsmanship professionally. Being an art educator, I have honed my skills as a practicing artist and designer, impartially fostering craft and creativity.\nUpon entering the St. Augustine Association, I was energized by the plethora of art outcomes and impressed with the variety of mediums, craftsmanship, and aesthetics. This was a tough judication and I wanted to be inclusive to what was submitted. Consequentially, the awards were decisively chosen with regards to craftsmanship, presentation, and creativity; with the notion in mind, that the diversity needs to be recognized.\nIt has been an honor to reward pieces that showed the ability of an artist to solve a visual art problem representing their dedication, craft, skillset, and imagination. Careful observation and practice are necessary in the evolution of an accomplished artist. Congratulations, St. Augustine Association Members, your works are profound, vast and demonstrate the creative possibilities of learning to see.\n.entry-content\nFall Members Show\nIn-Gallery & Online: September 5 - 28\nTROEMEL BEST IN SHOW: \"Sunset Sentry\" by Christel Fleming\nAVERY ST.

From its earliest founding, artist Jacques LeMoyne was sent by the French king to document images of the New World. In the early 1800s, John James Audubon trod the wilds of North Florida classifying and painting the abundant wildlife. At the turn of the century, oil tycoon Henry Flagler enticed artists from New England to paint in his opulent Hotel Ponce de Leon studios for the enjoyment of his wealthy patrons.\nEst. January 18, 1924\nThe St. Augustine Art Association emerged as part of local art history in 1924, when Nina Hawkins, the first female editor of The St. Augustine Record, gathered together wintering artists and writers to form The Pen & Brush Club, which soon became “The Galleon Club.”\nMiss Hawkins continued over the years to promote this St. Augustine group of artists through the local newspaper. Other charter members included photographer F. Victor Rahner, writers John and Georjina Jex, and painter John Parker. The\nGalleon Club\nwent through several fits and starts over the next few years, until in 1931, Hildegarde Mueller-Uri and J. Dexter Phinney organized the Club with the intent to transform St. Augustine into a major winter art colony. They persuaded the City of St. Augustine to allow them to use the former Waterworks building in Davenport Park as a clubhouse and exhibition gallery.\nWhen the Great Depression gripped the local economy, it was the successful ad campaign “Like Painting in Europe” launched by the artists and local businesses that drew flocks of artists to the Oldest City. The 1930’s and 40’s saw prominent artists moving to St. Augustine from up north like Nunzio Vayana, Edith Oliver, Louis Vogt, Bill Galpin, Tod Lindenmuth and his wife E.B. Warren, Anthony Thieme, Langston Moffett, and William and Lucy L’Engle.\nIn 1948, the club officially changed its name to the St. Augustine Art Association (STAAA). Membership was at an all-time high–over 500 members–and after moving around from one location to another over the years, it was time for the Art Association to build its own space. The land on Marine Street had been purchased by the organization in 1945 from Hildegarde Mueller-Uri’s parents and the building–what is now the main gallery–opened in February 1954.\nThrough the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, the STAAA continued to grow and expand exhibits, memberships and programs. It was incorporated as a non-profit and bylaws amended so that the property will always remain devoted to public charities with a preference for the arts. Despite some financial woes, the members and board directors were creative and held fundraisers like the Art-Mart, Beaux Arts Balls, workshops, concerts and performances. In 1998, thanks to funds donated by Joseph & Faith Tiberio, the building was expanded by the addition of the two wing galleries, allowing for more growth and space. In that same year a new source of funding became available, “The St. Augustine Art & Craft Festival.”\nToday, St. Augustine is home to many art galleries and artists, ranging from amateurs and students to internationally acclaimed professionals. With its extensive Permanent Collection of important St. Augustine art, large active membership and ever-expanding exhibitions, programs and partnerships, the STAAA thrives and is recognized as the cultural epicenter of the local art community.\nOn January 18, 1924, a handful of visionaries in St. Augustine, Florida, founded an art group that over time grew into a vibrant and influential force for the arts–the St. Augustine Art Association. This video features historian Susan Parker and two distinguished Art Association members, Tom Rahner and Kay Burtin. Their stories highlight the history of the founding of the St. Augustine Art Association. The project was produced for the Association’s 95th Anniversary in 2019, through a grant from The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida.\nThis symposium brought to life the people and personalities of St. Augustine’s mid-century art colony. The gathering featured local artists, historians and residents whose research, recollections and first-hand knowledge that shed light on the importance of this regional art movement. A figurative art exhibit with newly acquired and restored portraits complimented the discussion.\nThursday, April 7, 2011\nListen to the Symposium\n.entry-content\nABOUT THE ST.
