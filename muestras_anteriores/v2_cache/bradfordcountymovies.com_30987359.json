      "text": "About BCRAC, Sayre Theatre\nAbout BCRAC\nThe Bradford County Regional Arts Council is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building and supporting a thriving regional arts community by:\n- advocating for the Arts;\n- cultivating quality arts programming; and\n- preserving Bradford County's historic theatres as venues for performances, community events, and movies.\nFor information on BCRAC programs beyond the movies, please visit the Arts Council website at\nwww.bcrac.org\n.\nWho We Are\nElaine Poost\n|\nExecutive Director\nelaine@bcrac.org\nRenae Chamberlain\n|\nNTPAIE/PPA Director\nntpaie@bcrac.org\n|\nAdminstrative Assistant\ninfo@bcrac.org\nSabrina McEwen\n|\nGraphic Design/Communications\ngraphics@bcrac.org\nStefan Poost\n|\nMarketing\nmarketing@bcrac.org\nKelly Wilhelm\n|\nKeystone Theatre Manager, Senior Theatre Manager\nkeystone@bcrac.org\nSarah Brackel\n|\nSayre Theatre Manager\nsayre@bcrac.org\nOur History\nIn 1988, the Bradford County Regional Arts Council (BCRAC) hired Brooks Eldredge-Martin as its first employee and Executive Director. In the period 1988 to 1995, the BCRAC purchased, renovated and began operating the only three historic theatres remaining in Bradford County.\nAs a result of a 1996 long-range plan the BCRAC expanded its arts and cultural mission, \"to promote arts and culture in our region\" by becoming a Partner with the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts for re-granting and implementation of arts in education programs serving six counties in the Northern Tier.\nIn 1997, the BCRAC began to focus on arts in education programs for early childhood. The BCRAC formed the Learning Early Network, which was selected as a \"Best Practice in the Arts in Pennsylvania\" in 1999. On June 3, 2007 the BCRAC received the first-ever Americans for the Arts - Arts in Education Award in Las Vegas.\nIn 2000, the BCRAC became a Partner with the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts for re-granting funds in support of public, community arts activities. BCRAC now implements this program throughout seven counties in the Northern Tier.\nIn 2012, the BCRAC experienced a leadership change with the retirement of long-time Executive Director Brooks Eldredge-Martin.  This was followed closely by long-range planning and evaluation of the organization.\nContact\nBradford County Regional Arts Council\n601 Main Street\nTowanda, PA 18848\nPhone:\n570.268.ARTS (2787)\nFax:\n570.265.4558\nEmail:\ninfo@bcrac.org\nCOMING SOON\nA Big Bold Beautiful Journey\nA Big Bold Beautiful Journey OC\nGabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie\nOne Battle After Another\nJoe Ohrin Comedy Show\nRoofman\nTron: Ares\nHorizon: An American Saga Chapter 2\nSEE ALL\nThe Sayre Theatre\nAbout the Sayre Theatre\nMerchandise\nAbout BCRAC\nDonate\nBecome a Member\nOn-Screen Advertising\nFAQ\nLive Events\nSign up for our newsletter\nPrices\n205 S.
