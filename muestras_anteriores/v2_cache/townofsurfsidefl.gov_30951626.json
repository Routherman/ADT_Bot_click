Surfside is home to nearly 6,000 residents and has an attractive residential neighborhood featuring multi-family condominium and apartment buildings, and a charming business district, as well as public art, award-winning restaurants, resorts, spas and recreational facilities enjoyed by residents and visitors year-round.\nSurfside, Miami’s Uptown Beachtown, has earned a reputation as both a superb family community and a premier travel destination. It encompasses the area from 87th Terrace to 96th Street, between the City of Miami Beach to the South and the Village of Bal Harbour to the North, offering a mile of pristine public beach, parks, tennis, playgrounds, and recreational facilities, including a state-of-the-art Community Center and aquatics facility. Its two-block business and commercial district is bustling with restaurants, boutiques and services, many operated by small business owners.\nResidents and visitors can also find art sprinkled throughout Surfside, including a mural by Miami artist Douglas Hoekzema, a.k.a. Hoxxoh at the 96th Street Park, and a sculpture by Pablo Atchugarry at the beach end of 94th Street. The “Turtle Walk” public exhibition features colorful fiberglass turtle sculptures designed by local artists to raise awareness about loggerhead sea turtles, which return each year during nesting season.\nFounded on May 18, 1935, Surfside was incorporated through the signatures of 35 members of the Surf Club, a gathering place for the rich and famous. Guests included Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Winston Churchill and Dean Martin, among many others. The original historic structure was redeveloped into the Four Seasons Hotel at The Surf Club.\nSurfside began emerging after World War II and by 1957 had outgrown its original Town Hall. The current Town Hall was renovated in 2001 and serves as a hub of public services, and includes the Town Commission chambers, the offices of the Town Manager, Town Clerk, Solid Waste Department, Water and Sewer Department, Public Works Department, Code Compliance Division, Finance Department, Human Resources and Police Department.\nIn 1962, the town built the Community Center at 93rd Street, which was later torn down and rebuilt into a world-class recreation facility. This multi-purpose facility is a central meetup spot for Surfside residents and features a pool with lap lanes, plunge pool and slide, children’s activity pool, jacuzzi, and Surf-n-Sides poolside eatery. Additionally, the Community Center offers numerous events and programs for adults, seniors, teens and kids. Other community and recreational facilities include the Tennis Center, 96th Street Park, Hawthorne Tot Lot, Paws Up Dog Park, Veterans Park and Community Garden.\nOne thing that sets Surfside apart is its commitment to the quality of life of its residents. Old and new houses are mixed together in harmony, while maintaining a relaxing and charming beach town neighborhood setting.\nSustainability and green initiatives are a large focus in Surfside. Town efforts include banning plastic straws and Styrofoam; establishing incentives to promote the use of solar photovoltaic systems for Surfside residents and businesses; implementing the use of solar-powered garbage compaction containers and instituting requirements for environmentally-preferable building practices. Surfside also is a founding community of the Clean Energy Coastal Corridor under the\nProperty Accessed Clean Energy\n(PACE) Program and a member of the Compact of Mayors. Additionally, through the leadership of former Mayor Dietch, Surfside has joined hundreds of mayors by signing letters opposing the repeal of the federal Clean Power Plan.\nThe efficiency and effectiveness of Surfside's services are unparalleled. Garbage and trash is collected from all residences five days a week, while commercial buildings and businesses coordinate the number of trash pick-ups directly through the Town of Surfside.  Emergency police response time is approximately one minute. Entertainment and recreation programs are offered throughout the year. This has produced pride in the community's record of positive results and achievement in the public interest.\nCheck out the\n2020 Census data\nfor Surfside to take a more in-depth look into the Town's demographics.\nSilver Anniversary Book\nSurfside ACS Data Profile\n2010 - 2012 Miami-Dade Profile\nSurfside 2010 Census\nRelated Links\nAbout the Town of Surfside\nActivities and Events\nBecome Involved\nStreet Sweeping Schedule\nShort-Term Rentals\nSubscribe to Town News\nBe Hurricane & Flood Ready\n+\nHurricane Kit and Checklist\nFreebee Transportation Service\nYouth Council Job & Internship Hub\nBiophilic Cities\nStaff Directory\nResident Brochure\nEmergency Alerts",
