MY NAME IS RICK!”\nIt turned out that Rick and Andy had a lot in  common, with the biggest thread being home brewing.  Over the years they  brewed beer in each other’s driveway,  joined the\nDunedin Brewers Guild\ntogether, and spent a lot of time talking about and drinking good craft beer.\nBut  their fate wasn’t sealed yet.  Rick threw a little house keg party the  following Memorial day weekend, and had a huge turnout.  The ½ barrel  blew within the first hour or so.  Luckily Andy was there, and Rick  asked him what he had on tap at home.  He said he had most of a keg of  Anchor Steam flowing.  And Rick said, “Can I borrow it?”.  Andy said,  “Sure!”, so they grabbed a hand cart and snagged the keg out of the  fridge, and brought it to the party.  At that moment in time, Rick knew  he had a friend for life.  Anyone who will loan you the keg out of their  fridge is the type of guy you can trust.\nOver the years they talked about opening a  bar.
