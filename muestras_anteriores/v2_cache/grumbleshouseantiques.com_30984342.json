Built in 1908 when the town was booming due to the discovery of phosphate, the 4 bedroom home boasts 5 fireplaces, transom windows, a beautiful staircase and wood trim not typically found today.\nInside you’ll find antiques and cool pieces you can re-purpose as well as unique gifts, stained glass, home decor, gourmet foodstuff, bath & body products, handmade from local artists as well as some from across the globe and more.\nOutside we have whimsical balance stakes & spinners, seasonal plants & flowering trees, pottery planters, birdbaths, fountains, stepping stones & miscellaneous yard art in the spaces that connect the three buildings on the property. We carry natives, herbs, some tropicals, shrubs & houseplants as well as an edible section of veggies & fruit trees to help you garden at home, enhance your outdoor space or to gift that special someone who loves to embellish their yard.\nCedar Street Boutique is the teal building right behind Grumbles House that sells ladies clothing, jewelry & accessories as well as unique lighting, some furniture and even a small men’s clothing department. One of the rooms in the boutique is filled with home decor and vintage oddities so that those who aren’t looking for clothing can still be entertained.\nWhen your stomach growls, you don’t have to leave the property but can meander over to the bright pinkish-red WWII army barracks that houses Sweetie’s Cafe. Open Tues.-Sat. from 10am to 3pm, Sweetie’s serves scones, waffles and spinach scrambled egg quesadillas to those needing a late breakfast as well as sandwiches, salads, quiche, tomato pie or soup to the lunch bunch. Make a reservation for afternoon tea and enjoy dressing up in vintage hats & dresses and being served the tiny finger sandwiches, tea of course and dainty desserts for the sweet tooth.  To make reservations please call\n352-216-2510.\nWhen we bought the business in 1996, it was called Argyles Attic and was 98% antiques. Over the years we’ve infused art, lamps, mirrors, rugs and interesting small furniture collectively known as home decor. Dane is the one with the vision; always adding nice touches to take us to where we are today. He saved the WWII Army barracks from being torn down, moved it next door & he built the crosswalk, porch & fountain. He’s added walkways with our stepping stones and installed a kitchen in the barracks in hopes of a quaint cafe. In April of 2016, we welcomed Sweetie’s Cafe to our barracks and they are a great addition to our “campus”.\nBesides selling our own products, we consign antiques & gently used items for our customers and do our best to find them new homes. We also conduct Estate & Moving Sales outside the store.\nWe enjoy meeting new customers when we set up booths at Marion County Master Gardener’s Spring Festival, Kanapaha Botanical Gardens spring & fall shows, Cedar Lakes Woods & Gardens spring show as well as several out of area garden shows.\nWe host garden clubs at our place and sometimes travel to area clubs to speak at their meetings. Sign up for our newsletter on this site to stay informed about Garden Groupies and other events we host for our customers. Many events have yet to restart as we are still in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic but as soon as it’s safe, we will continue hosting classes, workshops, Music on the Porch and First Saturday VIllage Market.\nWe work hard to give our customers a great variety of quality merchandise to choose from at reasonable prices in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere that hopefully nurtures the soul.\nIn an effort to keep our prices reasonable, we ask customers to pay with cash or check when you can, thus reducing our exorbitant credit card fees.\nWe recycle plastic grocery bags to put your plants in to prevent getting your car dirty. We are also happy to recycle your water bottle or soda can to avoid it going into the landfill. We hope you’ll do your part to reduce, reuse and recycle, too.\nFolks ask us quite frequently to come to their home to help them with a landscape plan. If you are interested in this service, please ask at our register and we will get your information to the person who can help you.\nThanks for your interest in Grumbles House Antiques & Garden Shop!!\nend of Page content",
