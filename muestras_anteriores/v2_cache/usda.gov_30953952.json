Over 3 million acres of land located in 22 National Recreation Areas managed by the Forest Service is preserved for recreational activities like hiking, boating, fishing and swimming, while highlighting natural, cultural and scenic resources. Visitors who choose to recreate on these public lands find 162,984 miles of trails, over 30,000 recreation sites, over 400,000 miles of streams and 3 million acres of lakes, 127 alpine ski areas, 338,000 heritage sites, and specially designated sites that include 36.7 million acres of designated wilderness areas, 130 wild and scenic rivers, 12 monuments, and one preserve. And remember, “It’s All Yours.”\nEach National Forest unit is managed by a local team.
