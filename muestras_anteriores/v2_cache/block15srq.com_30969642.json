We were approached with the opportunity to buy our second bar and we went for it!! Our first bar is Siesta Key Wine Bar, located in Siesta Key and we are so pleased to now have a second wine bar in downtown Sarasota. We have always had a passion for food and wine and decided \"Why not open a Wine Bar?\" We want everyone who comes in to both bars to feel comfortable just coming in by yourself or with friends to drink delicious wine.\nEnd Section 2\nStart Section 4 Custom section\nBlock 15 Cork & Craft was just remodeled with a lot of thought and love and no detail went unnoticed. Many people ask us about our name? So many people may not know this but if the Vineyard is larger than several acres the Vineyard is generally partitioned into blocks. A block might represent a single variety, a soil type, or topographic features such as grade, existing fence lines, roads, or natural features like streams or rock outcroppings. We are also on the 1500 Block of Main Street, so we thought Block 15 fits perfect! So we went with Block 15 Cork and Craft. We decided to keep the wine and beer wall because people really have so much fun with it! We also offer a full wine menu, flights, happy hour, fun new cocktails, seltzers, beers, and food will be coming soon!\nMost of our time was spent living in Scottsdale, AZ but we have lived in many great places including Telluride, CO., Seattle, WA., Akron, OH., and one of our favorite places: Playa del Carmen, Mexico, where we just recently got married on our ten year anniversary. We love our dogs, cerveza, wine, and our simple life! We love to travel and just offered our first wine bar trip to Portugal with some of our closest customers and friends. We are both avid travelers, foodies, wine and beer lovers, runners, fisherman, boaters, and also have a love for Real Estate. We have both been in the restaurant industry for a long time and wanted to continue to dive into it.\nWe hope that you will come visit our bars and drink some delicious wine with us.\nEnd  Section 4 Custom section\nStart Section 3\nContact us:\nby phone\n(941)-404-9937,\nby email\nmelbdodge@gmail.com\nEnd Section 3\nStart Section 1\nBlock 15 Cork and Craft\nDot slide navigation number 1\nDot slide navigation number 2\nDot slide navigation number 3\nslideshow start stop playing\nBlock 15 Cork and Craft\nEnd Section 1\nStart Section 2\nAbout us\nIt has always been a dream of ours to open a bar so we opened our first bar in 2020 and always dreamed of having more than just one.
