They met, fell in love, and married. After the opening of their families restaurant, Paradise Village on Mt. Rainier in the beautiful state of Washington, the Popkovs knew they wanted to continue their calling of serving others here in Florida. Both from large families, their homes were always bustling with family and visitors. Throughout childhood they learned how families and friends bonded over lovingly crafted food. Their dream was to offer a restaurant with outstanding service, a home-like atmosphere, and meals made from scratch just like when they grew up.\nAfter moving to Florida and an awe inspiring trip to Greece where they saw the importance of family, food and culture, they began the search for a restaurant to call their own. They found and purchased a Greek themed restaurant. The menu conveniently matched their culinary goals. The Greek Grille was born, the Popkovs have further developed and enhanced the menu and updated the restaurant's interior.\nRelishing good wine and adoring Greek cuisine, the Popkovs enjoy loud get-togethers of friends and family around the table! Delicious Greek food can now be found close to home. The Greek Grille skillfully serves lamb shank, moussaka, and other authentic Greek dishes under the watchful eye of executive chef, Gary Golden, using the most authentic and highest quality ingredients. Greek Grille's traditional recipes and fine wines combined with the addition of friends and family makes the perfect combination for time well spent.\nCome to enjoy the delicious authentic Greek cuisine and leave knowing you are now part of the Greek Grille family.\nORDER ONLINE\nVIEW OUR MENU\nHelpful Links\nHOME\nMENU\nSPECIAL OFFERS\nCONTACT\nABOUT US\nWINE TASTING\nHours of Operations\nMon - Fri: 11:00 AM - 8:30 PM\nSat: 1:00 PM - 8:30 PM\nSunday Closed\n(Stop sitting at 8:00 PM.
