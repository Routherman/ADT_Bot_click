All franchise applicants must have extensive experience as the General Manager or owner/operator of a full service, sit down restaurant similar to a Moxies (premium casual, high volume, dining room & lounge). New franchisees must be the primary operator of their Moxie’s location, so career experience is critical.\nNo franchise applicant may have other business commitments within our industry. We expect 100% commitment to our brand.\nWe are no longer accepting new franchisees for locations in BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba or the Maritimes.\nPlease note that all new location opportunities are first offered to our current franchisees to help them expand their businesses, then secondly to our bank of internal applicants prepared to become franchisees. Any applicant from an external source, who we find to meet all of our criteria, can expect an extensive review period before a new location becomes available.\nFor more information about owning a Moxies franchise, please send an outline of your management experience in the Food and Hospitality industry to\nguestrelations@moxies.ca\n.
