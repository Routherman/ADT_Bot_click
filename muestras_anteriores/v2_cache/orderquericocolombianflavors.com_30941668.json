The lunch plates have generous portions. The grilled chicken and breaded pork are tender and juicy. The tres leches cake is heavenly. You will not be disappointed!\n-Terrence M.\n★★★★★\nWow. Amazing food and service. This place is packed every time I visit the area. I believe it has outgrown itself with all the customers they have. The food is authentic columbian, fresh and good. There is always a line up for food, but service is quick. There is seating accommodation but I always order to go. I ordered beef soup and a sour sop drink this time and it didn’t disappoint!\n-Sacha C.\n★★★★★\nQue-Rico is absolutely great! The food is fantastic, the staff are friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is fun! This is also a local establishment which is fantastic to support. My favorite dish is the chicken empanadas with the aji sauce added to the side!\n-Julia S.\nLeave A Review\nOrder Now\nGrid Photo Gallery\nContact Form\nQUE-RICO\nWe serve a variety of food here at Que Rico Colombian Restaurant.
