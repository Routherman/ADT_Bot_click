Notifications can include severe weather, evacuation information, fires, and other emergencies, as well as general important routine County information and announcements.\nMessages are sent to residents on preferred primary and secondary contact paths – cell phone, SMS/texts, home phone, or email – to ensure real-time access to potentially lifesaving information. The notifications will transmit to thousands of residents within seconds.\nRegister for Alert!Monroe\nResidents listed in the Monroe County public white and yellow page database were automatically subscribed to alerts by phone, but non-landline users can self-register cell phone and email information, provide or change additional contact or secondary information, or opt-out.\nIn addition to being able to send alerts to all users in the Florida Keys, the Everbridge technology system allows Monroe County Emergency Management to tailor information to specific geographical areas and neighborhoods.\n\"This technology is particularly important as we head into another hurricane season for helping keep Monroe County residents safe,\" said Shannon Weiner, Deputy Director of Monroe County Emergency Management. \"Communication is key for Emergency Management, and this system will allow us to reach residents with critical time-sensitive information quickly.\"\nThe program is used throughout the State of Florida and across the country and is funded by the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\nNotify Me\nMonroe County also has a wide variety of ways you can be notified about County government functions, including BOCC meetings, employment opportunities, news flashes, bid postings and calendar events.\nClick here to register for any or all of the above notifications.\n“Be Prepared, Get a Plan”\nFlorida’s Hurricane Season is from June 1 to November 30\nIn response to a hurricane emergency, the City of Marathon will strive to achieve the following:\nEvacuation and shelter of the vulnerable population and non-residents who do not leave the City in a category 1 or 2 storm, and open Refuge of Last Resort in category 3, 4, and 5 storms when required.\nPreservation of Public Property and vital records.\nMinimize the loss of private property.\nMinimize the impact and timing of response operations on the local level economy by coordinating with Monroe County and the National Hurricane Center to prevent unnecessary closure of businesses and evacuation of residents and guests.\nMinimize the impact of response operations on the environment.\nIdentify structures to be used as Shelter and Refuges of Last Resort in the City and communicate them to Monroe County.\nCoordinate all plans and programs with our Emergency Management Partners.\nPreservation of the continuity of local government.\nCity of Marathon canals will be closed to boat traffic at 36 hrs when a hurricane watch is issued. A hurricane watch is issued when there is a possibility that you could experience hurricane conditions within 36 hours. This will allow residents time to secure their vessels in the canal. Residents wishing to trailer their boats should do so before the issuance of a hurricane watch.\nWeb Links\nClick here for Monroe County’s Emergency Management\nMake Family Plan | Florida Disaster\nHealth and Safety After the Storm\nHurricane Hazards\nHurricane Basics\nPreparing Your Boat\nRed Cross Hurricane Safety\nStorm Surge Information\nTracking Chart\nEvacuation Zones\nMonroe County Emergency Response Plan\nCreate an Emergency Supply Kit\nShelters\nInformation about Flood Zones\nNext steps to take during post disaster recovery\nSpecial Needs Registry\n[if IE]><div class=\"ie\"><![endif]\nAbout\nApparatus\nFire Marshal's Office\nFire Rescue's Thank You Letters\nSafe Haven Program\nAlarm Check Sheet\nFire Rescue Contact Information\nForms\nVacation Rentals\n[if IE]></div><![endif]\nContact Information\nStation #14\n8900 Overseas Highway\nMarathon, FL 33050\nPhone:\n(305) 743-5266\nEmail:\nfd@ci.marathon.fl.us\nHours\nMonday - Friday\n8:00 AM - 5:00 PM\nStation #15\n59265 Overseas Hwy\nMarathon, FL 33050\nPhone:\n(305) 743-7599\nEmail:\nfd@ci.marathon.fl.us\nAdministration\nChief - James Muro\nEmail:\nfd@ci.marathon.fl.us\nRecord Requests\nEmail:\nfd\n@ci.marathon.fl.us\nView Full Contact Details\nUpcoming Events\nFirefighter Pension Board Meeting\n11/13/2025 - 9:00am\nView the Fire Rescue Calendar\nEND CONTAINER 2\nSTART CONTAINER 3\nMarathon TV\nWastewater Emergency\nAccessibility\nNon-Discrimination\nContact Us\nSitemap\nStaff Login\n9805 Overseas Highway\nMarathon, Florida 33050 | 305-743-0033\nSewer Emergency Line: 305-517-6764\n&nbsp; is for a non breaking space and &#8209; is for a non breaking hyphen\na municode design\nEND CONTAINER 3\npage-outer",

and in accordance with Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, the City Council has levied an excise tax of 1.85% on insurance companies doing business within the corporate limits of the City on the gross amount of receipts from premiums collected on property insurance policies covering property within the corporate limits of the City; and in accordance with Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, the excise tax monies will be used by the City to establish and fund a defined benefit pension plan for the City’s firefighters; and the City Council finds that the establishment of a defined benefit plan for the City’s firefighters in accordance with Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, is in the best interest of the City.\nThe Fire Fighter Pension Board is comprised of the following five members; two of the members shall be legal residents of the City and are appointed by the City Council.  Two of the members shall be full time firefighters of the City elected by a majority of the active firefighters who are members of the plan.  The fifth member of the Pension Board shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four Board members.  The name of the fifth Board member is then submitted to City Council who appoints such person to the board.\nMembers\nChristopher Cameron, Chairman\nEdwin Marquez, Secretary\nMike Card, Member\nMary Rice, Member\nMike Puto, Member\nSupporting Documents\nRequired Disclosures\n(816 KB)\nActuarial Valuation\n(13 MB)\n[if IE]><div class=\"ie\"><![endif]\nAgendas/Minutes\nApplication for Board, Committee, or Commission\nCity Council\nFire Fighter Pension Board\nPlanning Commission\nSpecial Magistrate\n[if IE]></div><![endif]\nContact Information\nPhone:\n(305) 743-0033\nCity Council:\ncouncil@ci.marathon.fl.us\nPlanning Commission:\nplanning@ci.marathon.fl.us\nCode Magistrate:\ncode@ci.marathon.fl.us\nFire Fighter Pension Board:\nfd@ci.marathon.fl.us\nHours\nMonday - Friday\n8:00 AM - 5:00 PM\nView Full Contact Details\nUpcoming Events\nFirefighter Pension Board Meeting\n11/13/2025 - 9:00am\nView the Fire Fighter Pension Board Calendar\nEND CONTAINER 2\nSTART CONTAINER 3\nMarathon TV\nWastewater Emergency\nAccessibility\nNon-Discrimination\nContact Us\nSitemap\nStaff Login\n9805 Overseas Highway\nMarathon, Florida 33050 | 305-743-0033\nSewer Emergency Line: 305-517-6764\n&nbsp;
