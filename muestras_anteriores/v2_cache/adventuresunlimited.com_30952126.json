During the pandemic, the week of an impending hurricane. The staff at Adventures Unlimited went above and beyond working with me during these difficult times. They were extremely flexible. Especially the day of, when our outdoor wedding got completely rained out and we had to move it inside. SO MANY crazy situations arose on this day. Jo Dee and the Adventures Unlimited staff went out of their way to accommodate us and make sure we were satisfied. I cannot thank them enough. They were there for me every step of the way.\nMy guests loved the adventure as well. Most everyone I have talked to about our wedding, said it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to. Guests loved the cabins and being able to have places to hangout together the day before and after the wedding\"\nKristy H.\n<div class=\"col-4 reviews-website\"> \n                    <img src=\"https://adventuresunlimited.com/wp-content/themes/auoc-theme/assets/images/website-example-review.webp\" class=\"img-fluid rounded-1 border-dark\" alt=\"cost to hire a website designer\">               \n                </div>\n<div class=\"col-4 reviews-website\"> \n                    <img src=\"https://adventuresunlimited.com/wp-content/themes/auoc-theme/assets/images/website-example-healthpro.webp\" class=\"img-fluid rounded-1 border\" alt=\"cost to hire a website designer\">               \n                </div>\n\"Went here for a spur of the moment with my friend. A bit of a drive from Pensacola, but it's worth it. The instructor's were really friendly, outgoing and funny. Especially the guy, he was quite the comedian. You work your way up from small potatoes to a 900 foot zip line over a river. It's pretty crazy. After the first few though, it's no longer nerve wrecking. So by the time you get to 900 feet, it's nothing but joy and pleasure. Super safe, super fun.\"\nMathew S.\nPrevious\nNext\nend reviews\nAdventures Unlimited Outdoor Center (AUOC) began with two canoes on top of a 1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass, then expanded to 30 canoes and a 1972 GMC three-quarter ton pickup (affectionately referred to as “Old Blue”).\nIn 1978, the original Tomahawk Landing was purchased on the Santa Rosa County courthouse steps.

The Blackwater River State Park was the main point of debarkation and phones were answered from the Sanborn family residence in Bagdad, Florida.\nIn 1978, the original Tomahawk Landing was purchased on the Santa Rosa County courthouse steps. It started out as one building and over the years developed into a complete lodging and water recreation resort. By 1982, Adventures Unlimited began adding lodging to further expand its services.  Currently there are three rustic camping cabins, the School House Inn (8 separate rooms, similar to hotel rooms), 20 furnished cottages/cabins (which includes the Lorax Loft unique treehouse) added in 2013, Katie’s Kaboose (2016) and Louisville/Nashville (Pullman car accommodations, 2020).  Two rustic camping cabins and eight cottages are designated as “pet friendly.”\nIn the summer of 1994, the Adventures Unlimited Low and High Challenge Courses were completed. As a result,  Adventures Unlimited has been a favored site for retreats of all kinds – schools, military, churches, non-profits, sports teams, corporations, scouts and many others – utilizing the challenges presented by these courses, lead AUOC to become one of the premiere courses in the Southeastern United States.\nIn 2010, we proudly unveiled the Zip Adventures Canopy Tour, offering adventure seekers the ability to soar through the glorious tree tops of Northwest Florida and over Coldwater Creek on nearly a mile of zip lines, some as high as 65′ in the air.\nThese programs and activities complement our fleet of  250 canoes, 100 kayaks, 500 tubes and 10 stand-up paddle boards for aquatic enjoyment. Adventures Unlimited also has nearly 100 acres on its Wilderness Resort location campgrounds for groups and individuals, a catering facility, group retreat cabins (which holds up to 70 people), private cabins, a playground, a nature trail, sports fields and a volleyball court.\nAdventures Unlimited continues to expand to meet the needs of all of our guests – families, honeymooners, friends and many more!  If there is anything Adventures Unlimited can do to meet your specific requests, please let us know!

Do you see that your staff responds with the same solutions repeatedly – even as they face new challenges? If you want your staff to become “breakthrough thinkers” – we can help.\nAdventures Unlimited utilizes the Low and High Challenge Courses as resources to assist your group to challenge their assumptions about themselves, the team and their problem-solving techniques. It’s designed to throw out “every day” thought patterns, teach new skills, expand their thinking, build confidence and mental flexibility, all while experiencing the great outdoors.\nBoth courses consist of a broad curriculum of programs that can be a completed in one-day or incorporated into a multi-day retreat. We will help you tailor the program to best fit the needs and goals of your group.\nAt the end of each course, time is set aside for reflection and evaluation. Together the group decides what worked, what didn’t, and what might be worth further exploration. Time is given to develop methods of carrying these lessons away with the group so that as a whole, the group is committed to continuing these new approaches as they move forward. And of course, these new approaches and ideas lead to every group’s number one goal: Success!\nOur Target Clients\nCorporations\nSmall businesses\nEducators\nTeachers with Classes\nNon-Profit Organizations\nClubs/Teams/Scouts\nGovernmental Organizations\nCommittees\nWhat can the Challenge Courses deliver to your team?\nEnhance team cohesiveness\nEmphasize group problem solving and decision making\nExplore the issues of high-quality leadership, mutual support, and individual commitment\nEnhance self confidence\nPromote effective risk-taking\nExamine group dynamics and practical problem solving\nStrengthen communication and cooperative spirit\nDiscover hidden strengths and abilities\nIncrease trust and group cohesion\nTranslating the TLC experience to the workplace\nFor more information contact our office at auocmail@gmail.com or 850-623-6197\nAdventures Unlimited Outdoor Center (AUOC) began with two canoes on top of a 1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass, then expanded to 30 canoes and a 1972 GMC three-quarter ton pickup (affectionately referred to as “Old Blue”).\nIn 1978, the original Tomahawk Landing was purchased on the Santa Rosa County courthouse steps.
