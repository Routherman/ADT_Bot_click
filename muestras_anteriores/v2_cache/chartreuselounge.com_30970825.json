In search of the warmer weather, he made his way to south to Tennessee for the whiskey, southern culture and cuisine. His journey then led him to Southwest Florida for the sun and amazing beaches. Nick is a bartender of the classic style and enjoys working each night behind the bar serving his guests and creating new drinks as well as contemporary interpretations of vintage cocktails.\nZach Moreno\nZach, originally from Rhode Island has lived in SWFL since childhood. His young career has always been in the service industry; where his interest and love for the world of cocktails grows every day.\nHis favorite part of working behind the bar is introducing and educating customers to both classic and innovative cocktails alike. Zach aims to deliver a uniquely incredible environment and experience for all.\nZach is an easygoing young man who lives for good times, good music, and spending time with his family.\nJusten Vargo\nBorn and raised in Tampa, Justen fell in love with the industry the moment he stepped into a bar back role in 2018. Now, his journey has brought him to Southwest Florida working for Chartreuse, where he’s cultivating cocktails and working hard to bring guests a fantastic imbibing experience. He loves to work with rum, gin, and mezcal. When he isn’t at the bar, he spends his free time with his loving girlfriend and two cats, Toothless and Westley, or in front of his gaming pc.\nOctavian Sulumete\nHi, I’m Octavian, originally from Romania, the same land that gave the world Count Dracula. I studied Hospitality at Manchester Metropolitan University and have been behind the bar for several years, from Europe to Colorado, and now Florida. For me, cocktails are more than drinks ,they’re stories in a glass. At Chartreuse, I focus on crafting elevated, thoughtful recipes that bring unique spirits and bold flavors together in unexpected, unforgettable ways.\nLauren Garchar\nWhat up doe!\nStraight outta Detroit, Mi Lauren is a versatile bartender that has over 13 years of experience in the hospitality industry.\nLauren thrives in a fast paced creative atmosphere that constantly allows her to expand her knowledge of her craft. Fueled by an adventurous and creative mindset she tries to pour her heart into anything she is involved in.\nLauren’s itch for creativity bleeds beyond the bar into many other avenues of art such as; photography, video, and graphic design. In her free time you may catch her in a moshpit at heavy metal concert or cuddled up with her two fur babies Patches and Bandit.\nEthan Howe\nFrom barista to barback, Ethan’s had a passion for making delicious drinks for the last 3 years. Although new to the world of the bar, he’s getting a crash course on how to make fresh, custom ingredients, and turn them into amazing cocktails. Ethan spends his free time reading, cooking, experimenting with new recipes, or playing with his kitten.\nBrijesh Soni\nCurrently a host/barback with aspirations of becoming a bartender. Born in Chicago, grew up in Georgia, and moved to Florida in 2022. Ever since I was young, I’ve been passionate about the art of craft cocktails, completely mesmerized by the harmony of flavors that come together in each creation. Driven and always on the move, I thrive on staying busy and constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skill set. As an avid explorer, I love uncovering new places and flavors, always striving to find the best of what life has to offer. With a wonderstruck heart and an open mind, I’m dedicated to crafting unforgettable moments.\n.entry-content .clear\n#post-##\n.entry-header\nOur Team\nMeet the Makers!\nNick Drohan\nNick, an avid Boston sports fan was born in Massachusetts where he first got his feet wet in the bar cocktail scene and began his lifelong preoccupation with rum.
