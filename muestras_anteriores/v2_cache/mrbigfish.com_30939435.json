My dad and grandfather spent their time in the kitchen cooking EVERYTHING from scratch, while my mom and grandmother worked in front of the house treating customers as if they were guests in our home. The joy and passion they brought to the restaurant business truly made a great impression on me.\nI missed the eating experience I remember as a child, in which our home was practically a restaurant in itself, where family and friends came to feast together -- simply and comfortably.\nThat’s what Mr. Big Fish is all about. A restaurant where people can relax and feel at home.\nWhere food is familiar, consistent, and comforting.\nWhere our guests receive the freshest food with the freshest ingredients, all at a great value. Where patrons recognize the passion that goes into everything we do. Simple. Traditional. Fresh.\nWe offer crisp salads, hot bread, delicious chowders, fresh local seafood (delivered daily), hand-cut steaks, good wines, and cold beer served in a comfortable atmosphere.\nPlease do not hesitate to let us know what we can do to make your dining experience better.\nEnd main content\nGlobal site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics\nADDRESS\n754 Neapolitan Way\nNaples, Fl 34103\nDIRECTIONS >\n239-262-4665 (HOOK)\nFIND US\nHOURS\u0003\nMonday – Saturday 3 – 9:30 PM\nClosed Sunday (Gone Fishing)\nClosed Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve & Christmas Day\nAccepting Reservations!\n239-262-4665 (HOOK)\n© Copyright Mr. Big Fish.
