To serve our veterans, the military and our communities. To advocate on behalf of all veterans.\nOur Vision:\nEnsure that veterans are respected for their service, always receive their earned entitlements, and are recognized for the sacrifices they and their loved ones have made on behalf of this great country.\n***END Simple Content Module Container***\n***SubLayout - Two Column RIGHT Sidebar***\nWho We Are\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States is a nonprofit veterans service organization comprised of eligible veterans and military service members from the active, guard and reserve forces.\nWe trace our roots back to 1899 when veterans of the Spanish-American War (1898) and the Philippine Insurrection (1899-1902) founded local organizations to secure rights and benefits for their service. Many arrived home wounded or sick. There was no medical care or veterans' pension for them, and they were left to care for themselves.\nIn their misery, some of these veterans banded together and formed organizations that would eventually band together and become known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. After chapters were formed in Ohio, Colorado and Pennsylvania, the movement quickly gained momentum. Today, membership stands at more than 1.4 million members of the VFW and its Auxiliary.\nOur voice was instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration,  development of the national cemetery system, in the fight for compensation for Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange and for veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome. In 2008, we won a long-fought victory with the passing of a GI Bill for the 21st Century, giving expanded educational benefits to America's active duty service members, and members of the guard and reserves, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. We were the driving force behind the Veterans Access and Accountability Act of 2014, and continually fight for improved VA medical centers services for women veterans. The VFW's legislative advocacy efforts were also the driving force behind the passage of the 2019 Blue Water Navy Veteran Act, and the passage of the 2022 Honoring Our PACT Act, which the VFW considers one of the most significant pieces of veterans legislation in history.\nBesides helping fund the creation of the Vietnam, Korean War, World War II and Women in Military Service memorials, in 2005 the VFW became the first veterans' organization to contribute to building the new Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial, which opened in November 2010. And in 2015, we became the first supporter of the Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial which broke ground in July of 2022 and is expected to be dedicated this year.\nWe have many programs and services that work to support veterans, service members and their families, as well as communities worldwide.

Taking advantage of all the benefits you've earned and DESERVE shouldn't be one of them! This is why we have teamed up with Student Veterans of America and Sport Clips Haircuts to provide the assistance you need.\nScholarships\nThe\nVFW's \"Sport Clips Help A Hero Scholarship\"\nprovides service members and veterans with the financial assistance they need to complete their educational goals without incurring excessive student loan debt. It’s just another way for us to say “thank you” to those who fought for our freedoms.\nScholarship Details:\nScholarships of up to $5,000 will be awarded to qualified applicants.\nAwarded scholarships are limited to one per family per semester.\nApplications for the fall semester will be accepted Jan. 1 through April 30.\nApplications for the spring semester will be accepted Aug. 1 through Nov. 15.\nFall semester scholarships will be awarded in August, and spring semester scholarships will be awarded in January.\nScholarships must be used by the end of the school semester for which the veteran is applying or they will become null and void.\nScholarships are restricted for tuition and fees only and will be paid directly to accredited schools.\nEligible Applicants Must:\nBe a citizen of the United States.\nBe retired, honorably discharged, active duty, or a member of the National Guard or Reserve.\nHave completed Basic Training and follow-on training (Advanced Individual Training, technical school, etc.).\nSeparated with or currently hold a military rank of E-5 or below.\nDemonstrate a need for financial assistance.\nParticipate in, be accepted to or currently enrolled in a VA-approved program or school at an accredited post-secondary institution.\nIf you have questions please\nview our FAQ\nor\nemail us\nwith additional questions.\nStudent Veteran Support Grant\nThe VFW recognizes that both funding and support for our student veterans and dependents at institutions of higher learning, can often be difficult to find. The\nVFW's Student Veteran Support Grant\noffers much needed assistance to support specific student veteran events. The grant, administered by the VFW Washington Office, focuses on supporting the overall student veteran population within the community, which consists of many student veterans at campuses across the country that are not affiliated with an SVA chapter. The grants will be disbursed to a VFW Post or Department that has submitted an application, to support the student veterans at the university or college.\nGrant Eligibility:\nApplicants must be VFW members associated with an appropriate entity of the VFW (VFW Post, District, Department, or National).\nAppropriate VFW Post, District, Department, or National leadership serve as the convening authority on the grant request and is responsible for receiving funds.\nFunds must be utilized for events and outreach designed to assist and support veterans currently enrolled in institutions of higher learning.\nGrants may be awarded up to $500 to support each event, and grants can be awarded to a VFW entity twice each fiscal year, totaling up to $1,000.\nVFW-SVA Legislative Fellowship\nWe have been advocating on behalf of veterans, service members and their families for more than a century, and we want to share our experience with a new generation of veteran leaders. The\nVFW-SVA Legislative Fellowship\ngrants exemplary student veterans (Fellows) the chance to join the VFW legislative team on Capitol Hill during the VFW Legislative Conference hosted in early spring each year. The Fellows will walk the halls of Congress, educating their legislators on the issues facing today’s student veterans and have the opportunity to meet with policy-makers from federal agencies responsible for implementing veterans' policy.\n***Small Resource Listing***\nStudent Veteran Resources\nREPEAT this row for each resource item\nGI Bill FAQ\nChoosing a School\nEducation and Career Resources\nGI Bill Comparison Tool\nLittle-Known Facts\nStudent Veterans of America\n***END Small Resource Listing***\n***Small Resource Listing***\nStudent Veteran Support Grant Resources\nREPEAT this row for each resource item\nGrant One Pager\nGrant Guidelines\nGrant Frequently Asked Questions\nGrant Post-Event Report\nFind a VFW Post Near You\n***END Small Resource Listing***\n*** Simple SIDE Content Module Container ***\nSupport those who support us!\nSport Clips\nis a proud supporter of the VFW's \"Sport Clips Help A Hero Scholarship\" program.\nSupport those who support us by visiting your local Sport Clips store today.\nFind your store\n.\n***END Simple SIDE Content Module Container ***\n*** Simple SIDE Content Module Container ***\n***END Simple SIDE Content Module Container ***\n***END SubLayout - Two Column RIGHT Sidebar***\nJoin\nEligibility\nMember Benefits\nRenew\nVFW Auxiliary\nAssistance\nVA Claims & Separation Benefits\nFinancial Grants\nStudent Veteran Support\nMental Wellness\nAdvocacy\nLegislative Priorities\nNational Security & Foreign Affairs\nWomen Veterans\nGrassroots Efforts\nVA Health Care Watch\nMedia & Events\nLatest Releases\nMedia Room\n126th VFW National Convention\nVFW Magazine\nCommunity\nYouth & Education\nTroop Support\n#StillServing\nVFW Combat Tested Gaming\nLocal Initiatives\nFlag Etiquette\n© 2025 All rights reserved. | ® ™ ℠ Trademarks and service marks of VFW.\r\n                    |\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nTerms of Use\n|\nSitemap\n|\nCareers\n|\nContact Us\n|\nOur Allies\n|\nFAQ\n|\nAbout Us\n***END Footer***\nt\no\np\nBootstrap 3.3.7 Migration\n<script src=\"/Assets/VFWSite/Scripts/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>",
