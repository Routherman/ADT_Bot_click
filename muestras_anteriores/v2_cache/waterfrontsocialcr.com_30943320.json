      "text": "About\nDecades of Experience Culminate in Waterfront Social\nThe Operators\nA Florida Native and established Executive Chef, Richard Wiggins relocated from Washington, DC and returned to his Florida roots with his family. Calling Citrus County home in 2016 he and his wife, Tiffany, opened their first venture,\nKatch Twenty Two\n, offering a casual fine dining experience in an intimate setting that soon became popular with the local community,  Katch Mobile – their Food Truck – soon followed.\nRichard spent his early culinary years in private restaurants followed by twenty years in Hotels working for Hyatt Hotels and Starwood Hotels at landmark properties such as the Grant Hyatt Atlanta, the former Westin Diplomat, the Westin St. John Resort & Villas and the W Hotel Washington DC.  And because he wasn’t quite able to completely leave the Hotel world behind, when his schedule allows, Richard provides culinary consulting and has assisted Marriott & Hilton in establishing or revamping their Food & Beverage operations at properties across the county.\nThe “face” of the Wiggins Duo (because Richard prefers to spend his time in the kitchen), Tiffany also boasts an 18-year hospitality career with Starwood Hotels, Fairmont Hotels and Marriott International.  Until Covid-19 disrupted her career, Tiffany maintained a full-time job with Marriott International while overseeing the day-to-day Front of House operations for Katch Twenty Two.  Having added a second restaurant to their name, Tiffany now assists with managing the operational demands of both Katch Twenty Two and Waterfront Social.  Her dedication to food, wine and outstanding customer service is apparent to all who meet her.\nAdditional Questions?\nLet Us Know How We Can Help\nContact Us",
