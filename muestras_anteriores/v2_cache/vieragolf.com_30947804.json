Designed by the legendary Joe Lee, our championship 18-hole golf course is a masterpiece, incorporating the natural terrain, native marshlands, and scenic lakes of Viera. With generous landing areas and well-defined fairways, the course offers a fair but challenging test of golf, thanks to Lee’s creative use of bunkering and the coastal breezes that often prevail. Even low handicappers will be pushed to their limits.\nBut don’t let the challenge scare you away. The course is a delight to play, especially if you choose the appropriate tees. Trust us, it’s worth the drive from Orlando to experience this gem of a course. Come play at Viera East Golf Course and see for yourself why it’s one of Joe Lee’s finest creations. We promise you won’t be disappointed.\n\nBook A Tee Time\nScorecard\n2025 Rates\nPublic Rates: 4/16/2025 – 5/31/2025\nPublic Rates: 06/01/2025 – 09/15/2025\nPublic\nSUMMER SEASON JUNE 1ST – OCTOBER 15TH, 2025\n18 Hole Rate\nWeekday\n(Mon – Thurs)\nWeekend\n(Fri – Sun)\nBefore 12pm\n$54.87\n$60.97\nAfter 12pm\n$43.90\n$48.77\nAfter 2pm\n$32.92\n$36.58\nTwilight Rate (after 4pm)\n$25.00\n$30.00\nPublic\nSUMMER SEASON JUNE 1ST – OCTOBER 15TH, 2025\n9 Hole Rate\nWeekday\n(Mon – Thurs)\nWeekend\n(Fri – Sun)\nBefore 12pm\n$43.87\n$47.08\nAfter 12pm\n$26.32\n$37.66\nAfter 2pm\n$26.32\n$28.25\nTwilight Rate (after 4pm)\n$25.00\n$30.00\nCDD Resident Rates: 4/16/25 – 5/31/2025\nCDD – Residents\nSUMMER SEASON JUNE 1ST – OCTOBER 15TH, 2025\n18 Hole Rate\nWeekday\n(Mon – Thurs)\nWeekend\n(Fri – Sun)\nBefore 12pm\n$38.40\n$36.60\nAfter 12pm\n$30.70\n$29.30\nAfter 2pm\n$23.00\n$21.90\nTwilight Rate (after 4pm)\n$17.50\n$18.00\nCDD – Residents\nSUMMER SEASON JUNE 1ST – OCTOBER 15TH, 2025\n9 Hole Rate\nWeekday\n(Mon – Thurs)\nWeekend\n(Fri – Sun)\nBefore 12pm\n$30.70\n$28.20\nAfter 12pm\n$18.40\n$22.60\nAfter 2pm\n$18.40\n$16.90\nTwilight Rate (after 2pm)\n$17.50\n$18.00\nViera East CDD residents pay property taxes that support the golf course, and for this reason they are eligible for lower green’s fees.
