Since then, the restaurant has expanded to include three additional locations:  Kendall, Coral Springs, and Weston, FL. The menus at Moon Thai and Japanese are carefully prepared with only the highest quality ingredients.

Please feel free to send us your comments or suggestions as our goal is to meet the needs of each and every one of our customers.  Thank you for visiting our site.\nCHEF PUNMA\nMy passion for cooking started out as a young child in my mother’s kitchen in Bangkok, Thailand.  We cooked food in the morning and sold the meals to the local market.  I had to do everything to help my mother, from pounding a mortar to make curry paste to climbing a coconut tree to retrieve a coconut.  My mother gave me the passion for cooking and I wouldn’t trade my passion for anything in the world. At the age of 26, I came to the United States and worked as a restaurant chef in order to support myself while attending college.  On August 3rd, 2000, I opened my first Moon Thai & Japanese restaurant in Coral Gables and it was an awesome experience.  Today, Moon Thai & Japanese has four locations:  Coral Gables, Kendall, Coral Springs and Weston, FL, and am excited to have this opportunity to provide you with the best and most innovative Thai and Japanese selections. We look forward to having you as our special guest.\nIN THE NEWS\nMOON THAI ORGANIC: HOW TO DINE OUT AND EAT ORGANIC IN MIAMI\nBY PRISCILLA BLOSSOM\nTHURSDAY, MAY 18, 2017\nSome might think it’s hype, but why wouldn’t you want to be sure what’s on your plate is free from chemically formulated fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones, and antibiotics?...\n\nREAD FULL ARTICLE\nMOON THAI AND JAPANESE\nBY CANDACE WEST\nMONDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2016\nMichelle Bernstein and guests review Moon Thai and Japanese in Weston, FL....\n\nVIEW VIDEO\nMOON THAI: APPROACHABLE TWISTS ON TRADITIONAL THAI FOOD\nBY CANDACE WEST\nTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2015\nAsk anyone from Thailand if he dines out at American Thai restaurants and he'll most likely tell you no.
