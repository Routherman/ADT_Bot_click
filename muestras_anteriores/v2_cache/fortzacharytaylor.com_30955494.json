Following the ceremony your group can walk down the Beach towards the cafe or hop on a quick ride to the Fort for your private reception. The Park officially closes to the public at sunset, at that time the venue becomes exclusive to your party. The newly updated deck with Tiki Roof is the perfect spot for cocktail hour and dancing. Usually your dinner tables will be set up in the sand in the midst of beautiful vegetation under the twinkle lights. However we can flip flop it with dining under the tiki and dancing on the beach. To create the perfect ambiance a fire pit is set up on the main beach area beyond your dinner tables. Imagine…. dancing under a canopy of stars on the beach in Key West surrounded by only your friends and family!\nFind everything you need to make your dream wedding come true.\nPlease contact us for more information regarding availability, package information, and a personalized quote.
