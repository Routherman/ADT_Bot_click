On-site\nteam members must be able to trust the company, and the company must be able to trust all on-\nsite team members. Always telling the truth is a given, but trust and integrity also incorporates\nmutual respect, saying what you do and doing what you say, and being impeccable with your\nword. This includes building trust with residents and having mutual respect for everyone in the community.\nLevel 10 Leadership\nGreat leadership comes from a servant mindset, always asking how we can best serve\nour community and its residents by maintaining high standards for ourselves and the entire team. Highest level leadership includes taking full ownership of our individual roles on the team, holding ourselves accountable as well as holding our team members accountable, trusting but verifying\nwork performance, and having an expectation that everyone on the team acts as if the property\nwas their own property – are we being the “mayors” of our communities?\nRelentless Improvement\nWe continually seek improvement and strive for excellence in all we do. We work together as a team to identify areas for improvement to maintain the highest standards possible for our communities.\nExtreme Ownership Extreme Collaboration\nEach team member takes full ownership of their role – we have a no excuses mentality. We take full ownership of ﬁnding and executing solutions to challenges. We collaborate with our team members, and we do so with a positive attitude and a focus on respectful communication across the team.\nLevel 10 Customer Service\nWe embody excellence in customer service. We lead with pleasant and positive attitudes, yet are ﬁrm but fair when needed. We always use respectful communication. We treat all prospects and residents equally, abiding by fair housing laws at all times. We use proper documentation, ensure follow up to resident concerns, and have a strong focus on conﬂict resolution and de-escalating situations.\nThese core values reflect the principles that guide our company’s culture and operations. They are more\nthan just words on a page; they are the foundation of how we work and make decisions. By upholding these values, we can continue to grow and achieve success while staying true to who we are.\nDo you want more information?\nFill out the form below.
