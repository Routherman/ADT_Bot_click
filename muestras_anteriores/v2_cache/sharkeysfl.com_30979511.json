Richie best bar owner in the business\nKimberly Grant\n06:49 08 Dec 24\nDepends on the bartender or the server, service can be fantastic (Rob or Becca) or not..\nFrancis Sanatan\n21:15 03 Dec 24\nSaw a live band here Saturday night, good music and great drink selection. The service was excellent.\nJock\n13:02 03 Dec 24\nThis is one of the best places ever why didn’t I know about you guys sooner food is amazing. Drinks aren’t water down like other bars wings are great. I have nothing bad to say.\nPatricia Maynard\n17:02 01 Dec 24\nThey really do have great bands here. I saw a slingshot Mafia, I do follow them as they are a favorite of mine. The service was very good. I did not eat. The only thing I can say is the house margaritas were $12 and to me that’s a little expensive. However my sister did enjoy the bucket of beer.\nAlex Rezabek\n21:11 08 Nov 24\nCool atmosphere,  seems like a veteran, military bar! We felt welcome, beer was cold music was good. Had a variety of music playing. Food was ok, artichoke spin dip was a little short of taste but creamy! Flatbread tasted like a dirty oven, you know what taste I’m talking about, was good but had that oven tastes to it. Would go back and give it another go and order some wings and a burger and try that route. Until stop bye and get a cool one and try the food!\nHawaiiBobsGardenArt\n13:43 29 Sep 24\nIt was An amazing experience to be had by all the place was packed. Everybody was singing and dancing with big smiles on their face. The band was fire. The lead vocalist , the guitarist, and  the drummer! They have an amazing  light show the sound system is not too loud. Better make a reservation if you want to get a table to eat happy times.\nAndrew Mackey\n02:09 14 Sep 24\nStopped in here on a Friday night, the band was awesome. Service is great, beer is cold! But these wings, probably the best tasting sauce I’ve ever had on wings. I think they called them Richie’s way or something like that, but truly amazing, I love them, I wanted to put the rest of the sauce in my pocket!  Our server Taylor was great, found us in this busy place every time we needed a drink, she made the experience that much better, highly recommend this place!  Not to mention..Veteran owned 🇺🇲\nBrittany Schubert\n10:03 03 Aug 24\nOkay so..love what they have going on here. Awesome happy hour prices. The Philly sliders are great! That toasted bun makes a difference.  Everytime we have been service has been outstanding. Tori❤️????????Being in the industry, she knows what she is doing. Gave us space when she could tell we were talking, but yet checked on us at all the perfect times. Plates napkins silverware brought before food, We all know thats damn near impossible to get these days. All with a SMILE! Who would have thought thats contagious anymore. A+ to Tori. The other girls were great too! They do something different almost everyday keeping it interesting for the regulars/locals. Taco Tuesday, (pretty good) Wing Wednesday, (where the heck can you get perfect wings for $1 each anymore) karaoke, pool tables, darts, and more! They play all football games and UFC fights. Cant wait to try more things on this extensive menu. The only thing that caught my attention when we walked in was a smell you can’t ignore. Hopefully they will do some extensive cleaning and put the same effort into their surroundings as they do the food. I hear they are expanding and opening up the wall to the next space. Maybe this will do it. A little love and face-lift (not really face-lift because the outside is great, but you know) will do the trick. See ya soon Sharkys ????\nCy Salmon\n23:17 01 Aug 24\nI did a Google search for a new restaurant, and this one came up. This is another hidden gem. Staff was friendly food was very good. I challenged them on their shrimp scampi, and they passed with flying colors. The wife loved it. This will be another one to revisit. I wasn’t going to take a Pic of the scampi because my wife got to it before I could. 😂\nWeekend Concierge\n03:53 01 Aug 24\nThe friendliest spot in town, whether you’re looking for a drink, a bite to eat, a place to watch sports on TVs inside and out, Karaoke or Live Music. Bands play 4 days a week!\nYashekia T\n20:43 31 Jul 24\nBonnie Durst\n14:40 31 Jul 24\nService is Life / Work is Love Made Visible\n14:31 09 Jan 24\nThis establishment has undergone impressive improvements since its recent change in ownership. The owner is super cool and amicable!\nFrom the provision of live music entertainment to the current requirement for smokers to utilize an outdoor seating area, people now have the opportunity to indulge in these activities while simultaneously enjoying a selection of delectable food and beverages..\nWe had such much fun and the servers are always attentive and professional.\nI suggest this location for experiencing live music, watching sports games, and having a great time with loved ones.\nScot Spiwak\n21:39 25 Dec 23\nWent to Sharkey’s on Christmas, one of the few places open. Was pleasantly surprised how good the food and the service was. I had the Chicken Philly and my companion had the regular Philly with fries. Both were delicious and came with a big heaping of fries. Would order again. We will definitely return again on one of their live music nights. :)\nLeave A Review\nFacebook Reviews\nEnjoy great food, live music, and a friendly atmosphere.
