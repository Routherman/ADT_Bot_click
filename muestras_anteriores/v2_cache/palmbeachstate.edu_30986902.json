Alumni enter the workforce with the skills and knowledge to innovate\n                     in fields such as business, finance, technology, public service, health care, law,\n                     criminal justice, and other industries.\nFounded in 1933 as Florida’s first public community college, Palm Beach State has\n                     grown from serving 41 local students to serving more than 40,000 from more than 150\n                     countries across five campuses as well as online.\nOne of the top producers of associate degree graduates in the U.S., PBSC also offers\n                     baccalaureate degrees, professional certificates, customized career training, and\n                     corporate and continuing education.\nThrough the years, Palm Beach State College has expanded its mission, programs and\n                     reach to become the fifth largest (based on FTE) of the 28 colleges in the Florida\n                     College System. Each year, more Palm Beach County high school graduates choose PBSC\n                     than any other institution. Students enroll at locations in Lake Worth, Boca Raton,\n                     Palm Beach Gardens, Belle Glade and Loxahatchee Groves, as well as take courses online.\nA Capable, Prepared Workforce\nPalm Beach State offers education pathways in Arts, Communication, Design & Humanities;\n                     Business, Education, Human Services, Social & Behavioral Science; Health Sciences;\n                     Industry, Manufacturing, Construction & Transportation; Public Safety; and Science,\n                     Technology, Engineering & Math.\nInnovative instruction focuses on new technologies, global challenges and local concerns.\n                     Graduates are prepared for the next step in their education or to hit the ground running\n                     in a new career. Students also benefit from the PBSC’s close working relationships\n                     with local employers.\nThe Associate in Arts degree attracts the largest share of enrollment. This “transfer\n                        degree” equals the first two years of a bachelor’s degree, and many A.A. students\n                        take advantage of Florida’s popular 2+2 guarantee of admission to a state university.\nWith a choice of more than 160 programs of study, Palm Beach State is also the county’s\n                        leading educator of skilled professionals. Our rich variety of programs range from\n                        Ophthalmic Medical Technology—one of only three programs nationwide that prepare students\n                        to assist eye physicians and surgeons— to our Dr. Floyd F. Koch Honors College, which\n                        offers challenging opportunities to excel and learn. Graduates of PBSC’s Engineering\n                        Technology and Electrical Power Technology programs are going directly into careers\n                        in advanced manufacturing, aerospace and energy. A first in Palm Beach County, the\n                        Marine Service Technology program helps meet the need for technicians in Florida’s\n                        recreational marine and boating industry. And students interested in architecture\n                        will find a special Associate in Arts degree track designed to provide an immersive\n                        experience in architectural design.\nBachelor’s degree programs comprise one of the fastest-growing areas of the College.\n                        Currently, PBSC offers the Bachelor of Applied Science in Supervision & Management,\n                        the B.A.S. in Information Management, a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, a Bachelor\n                        of Science in Human Services and a Bachelor of Science in Cardiopulmonary Sciences.\n                        These programs are designed for students who have completed associate degrees and\n                        now wish to equip themselves for advancement or leadership in their field.\nA College for the Community\nPalm Beach State College enriches every corner of the county through its commitment\n                     to quality and attention to community needs.

More than\n                           400 professionals participate in PBSC business partnership councils for their field.\n                           Through this involvement, students reap valuable internship and networking opportunities.\nAffordable Tuition:\nPalm Beach State is one of the most affordable public colleges in Florida and the\n                           nation. PBSC’s low tuition, along with financial aid and scholarships, makes college\n                           possible for students of all income levels.\nInspired Learning Environments:\nCommitted to sustainable planning, design and construction, Palm Beach State’s built\n                           environment has been recognized for its energy-saving innovations, smart use of learning\n                           technologies, and authentic replication of workplace settings.\nCaring Atmosphere:\nWith an average class size of 23, PBSC students benefit from ongoing one-on-one attention.\n                           Plus, support services range from academic advising and career centers to tutoring,\n                           counseling and help for students with special needs.\nCultural Hubs:\nRenowned music, dance and theatre companies as well as visual and performing artists\n                           appear year-round at PBSC’s theatres and galleries, which have drawn large public\n                           audiences for decades. Students also perform and show their work in these venues.\nRich Campus Life:\nPalm Beach State gives students choices for meaningful activities beyond the classroom\n                        with more than 100 clubs and organizations, competitive athletics, student government,\n                        volunteer activities and special events.",
