Since that time, the lush museum property has evolved The Grand Oaks Resort of today with a variety of new features including our RV Park, covered arena, and new guest accommodations and amenities.\nTom Golisano is a noted American entrepreneur and philanthropist. Golisano is the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Paychex, Inc., the second largest payroll processing company in the U.S., and he served as its President and Chief Executive Officer until 2004. He founded the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in 1985 to provide and improve services for individuals with developmental disabilities, and he and is the Special Olympics’ largest individual contributor. Golisano has often been recognized for his entrepreneurial, civic, and philanthropic achievements and endeavors. Paychex is a Fortune 1000 company, and Golisano was listed among Forbes’ Top 10 Bosses in the U.S. for three consecutive years, beginning in 2002.\nKACY TIPTON-FASHIK\nGeneral Manager\nGrand Oaks Resort & Saddle Club has promoted Kacy Tipton-Fashik to General Manager.\nKacy Tipton-Fashik previously served as the resort’s Equine Manager and Assistant Manager, under Thomas Warriner. Warriner had been instrumental in marketing both resort and competition based equine ventures throughout the US, South and Central America and the Pacific basin. In her new role, she is responsible for leading the resort staff, orchestrating major events, overseeing the guest experience, and managing all day-to-day business at Grand Oaks.\n“I am delighted to continue to grow in my career here at Grand Oaks,” Tipton-Fashik said. “Our combination of natural beauty, guest amenities, and signature equestrian facilities and events makes this a resort unlike any other.”\nTipton-Fashik brings extensive experience at the resort to her new role as General Manager. She first started at the property in November 1999, when it was still known as the Florida Carriage Museum. Over the years, she has helped grow Grand Oaks into the unique destination for equestrians, leisure travelers, and sporting enthusiasts that it is today.\nWith a lifetime of riding and equestrian sports enthusiasm, and more than a decade of business management experience, Tipton-Fashik is well suited to lead Grand Oaks into the future. She also enjoys the variety of activities at Grand Oaks and the laid-back family resort atmosphere.\n352.750.5500 • Ext. 229\nE-MAIL KACY\nPLEASE NOTE\n: All guests and competitors must view and sign our liability release online.\nSIGN RELEASE\nToggle Navigation\nIMAGE GALLERY\nCONTACT US\nContact the Grand Oaks\nSafety & Emergency Numbers\nEVENT PLANNERS\nBanquets\nCorporate Outings\nFOR SALE\nNEWSLETTER SIGNUP\nGUEST LIABILITY RELEASE\n3000 Marion County Road\nWeirsdale, Florida 32195\n352.750.5500\nFOLLOW US:\nResort Maps & Directions\nfusion-row\nOur Team\nAdmin\n2022-09-30T11:41:43-04:00\nLoading...\nMEET THE GRAND OAKS TEAM\nTOM GOLISANO\nOwner\nIn March of 2011, a new plan for development of an equine destination resort in central Florida was launched with Tom Golisano’s purchase of the Florida Carriage Museum.
