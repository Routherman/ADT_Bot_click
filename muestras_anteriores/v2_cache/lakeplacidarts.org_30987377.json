      "text": "What is your refund policy?\nA full refund will be granted for requests made up to 48 hours before a performance. For requests made within 48 hours before the performance, credit towards a future performance (equal to the dollar amount of the ticket purchased) will be offered.\nWhen is the Box Office open?\nThe Box Office is open Thursday – Saturday from 1-5 pm and 1.5 hours before each performance.\nWhat time should I arrive at the theatre?\n30-45 minutes before the show begins is a great time to arrive. This will give you ample time to find parking, visit Will Call, take a look through the Gallery @ LPCA, etc. before the theatre is opened for seating.\nDo you have any COVID-19 policies/restrictions?\nFor all activities at the LPCA, masking is now optional and proof of vaccination/negative COVID test results are no longer required. This includes classes, events/performances and visits to the galleries.\nWe support each individual’s choice to wear a mask or not as we work to create an accepting and inclusive center for all.\nGoing forward, we will continue to monitor the situation so that we can respond with necessary changes to our policies if and when they’re needed.\nIf you have any questions about our policies or about COVID safety resources in the area, please feel free to reach out to\n[email protected]\nor 518.523.2512.\nWhat if I lost or can’t print my emailed ticket?\nNo need to print your ticket; we can scan tickets right on your phone. If you lost the email with your ticket, visit our Box Office for assistance.\nWhat qualifies as a Youth or Student ticket?\nYouth or Student ticket prices are for age 18 and younger, unless otherwise indicated. (E.g., sometimes Youth tickets might be designated as 12 and under.)\nHow big is the LPCA Theatre?\nThe LPCA Theatre seats 355 people. View the\nseating chart here\n.\nDo you serve concessions?\nYes, we typically have wine, beer, soft drinks and select snacks available for purchase before a performance and during intermission if there is one. (Popcorn is served only for film screenings.)\nOccasionally concessions are closed upon the request of the performer, so we always encourage you to check with the Box Office (518.523.2512) if you have any questions before the show!\nDo you offer group ticketing rates?\nDepending on the show, we may be able to offer special rates for groups of 8 or more. Please contact our Box Office at 518.523.2512 if you would like to make arrangements for a group!\nWhy is there a ticketing fee?\nThe ticketing fee helps us to cover the cost of processing ticket sales online. We realize how frustrating it can be when your tickets cost more than you expected, so we work to avoid multiple transaction fees that you may have encountered buying tickets for events at larger venues.\nDo you have assisted hearing devices?\nA personal hearing assistance system is available in the theatre. To use this service, please speak with a Box Office representative when you arrive for a performance to pick up a device.\nHow can I tell if an event is live or shown on the movie screen?\nVisit the event page for the show you’re interested in to see if it is tagged as “Film” or a “Live Event.” If you’re still not sure, our Box Office staff are available to help clarify details – 518.523.2512 or\n[email protected]\n.\nWhat does “LPCA Partner Presentation” mean?\nAn “LPCA Partner Presentation” is an event that has been produced or curated by another organization outside the LPCA. The LPCA is glad to collaborate with organizations like the Lake Placid Sinfonietta, Adirondack Film and others to provide the theatre space and staffing that other groups need to present their own artistic content!\nStay updated with events, classes & special offers.\nJoin our email list and learn about everything there is to do at the LPCA!",
