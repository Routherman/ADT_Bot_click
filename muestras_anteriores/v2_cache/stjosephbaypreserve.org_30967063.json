This art camp for students in elementary school visited the Buffer to work on creating masterpieces that combined nature with printmaking and sketching.  Students first arrived early in the morning and began a drawing assignment that was meant to get them thinking about all the things they might see at the Buffer Preserve. Artistic interpretations and expectations ranged from trees to bears to buried treasure!\nWe then went on a tram tour just for this group of students and decided that we would put our theories to the test and see what we could find. We started out on Treasure Road but unfortunately didn’t find any gold coins, but we did see a variety of birds and a 170-year-old longleaf pine! We continued on our journey and saw an eagle nest, a recently burned area, and even our resident alligator, Surly! We then got out of the heat for a little bit and took a break for lunch.\nAfter a nice meal and a little time to cool off, we set back out on a nature hike to see what else we could find. We collected all sorts of specimens to practice sketching and making prints. We then went back to the visitor center and the students set out on making their beautiful artist creations. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end and our students left for the day, bringing with them all of their newfound knowledge and appreciation of our preserve’s natural resources!\n.entry-content\nbuffer preserve\nSt. Joseph Bay Preserves\nsummer art camp\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nAnimal Track Hike, Saturday, June 28th, 2025, 9:00 a.m. EDT\nJune 24, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\n.entry-content\nanimal track hike\nbuffer preserve\nguided tour\nSt. Joseph Bay Preserves\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nWildflower Walk, Monday, May 5th, 2025, 9:00 a.m. EDT\nApril 9, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\n.entry-content\nbuffer preserve\nguided tour\nSt. Joseph Bay Preserves\nwildflower walk\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nAnimal Track Hike, Saturday, April 19th, 2025, 10:00 a.m. EDT\nApril 9, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\n.entry-content\nanimal track hike\nbuffer preserve\nguided tour\nSt. Joseph Bay Preserves\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nBirding at the Buffer, Thursday, April 10, 2025\nMarch 23, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\n.entry-content\nbird watching\nbirding\nbuffer preserve\nguided tour\nst joseph bay\nNews\nFriends Newsletter February 2025\nMarch 4, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\n.entry-content\nFebruary 2025\nNewsletter\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nJoin Us for our Winter Bay Day Celebration – Saturday, February 1st, 2025\nJanuary 19, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\nJoin Us\nSaturday,\nFebruary 1st, 2025\nfor our popular\nWinter\nBay Day!    9am – 3pm EST\nFriends of St. Joseph Bay Preserves\npresent a day of education, shrimp and music.  Learn about the preserves and life along the bay.  There will be lots to see and lots to do.

However, the State is currently renovating the supports and decking at the Buffer office and visitor complex which made it impossible to hold our traditional October Bay Day fundraiser.  The Friends’ board struggled with the options of attempting our classic Bay Day with its low country boil and exhibits in a different location or creating a new type of public event.  In the end, Board members decided to attempt a family festival in the heart of the Buffer itself.  Our “Family Fest” was designed less as a fundraiser, and more of celebration designed to expose the beauty and nature of the Buffer Preserve to the public.  With that goal in mind, family fun activities were designed that were free to the public and attractive for all family members.\nIn addition, there were walking tacos, hot apple cider, a scavenger hunt, interpretive hiking, duck pond matchup, sack races and free prizes.  It was a wonderful day with clear skies, comfortable temperatures and no bugs!  A good time was had by all and well over a hundred people attended.\nThe second task undertaken by the Friends was to design and construct a display representing the Buffer Preserve for public viewing at the Annual Festival of Trees held at The Joe Center for the Arts in downtown Port St. Joe.  This major community event typically attracts over a thousand visitors with local businesses and organizations engaging in friendly competition to see who will receive the trophy for People’s Choice.  A group of Friends Board members decided to skipp the heavily decorated tree model opting for a tree display that was more educational in nature by illustrating an important practice in managing the Buffer forests.  The burnt material presented served to explain the role of managed burns in maintaining the health of the forest.  The festival of trees runs through Dec. 14 so there is time to see the display. More information can be found at their website:\nwww.thejoecenter.org\nWe are currently beginning our planning for the Friends upcoming Annual meeting set to occur at 10am on January 18\nth,\n2025 in the Buffer Visitor Center.  There will be a special lunch provided with a great selection of home-made chili to choose from.  The Friends will provide a brief snapshot of their 2024 activities and Megan Christopher Manager of the St. Joseph Bay Aquatic Preserve, and Dylan Shoemaker, Manager of the Buffer State Preserve will provide reviews of 2024 activities thar occurred in the two Preserves and provide a look at their future plans.\nOpportunities working directly with the Friends:\nThe Friends of St. Joseph Bay Preserves are also interested in locating volunteers who can assist us with special projects such as the continuing development of the new interpretive trail in the Buffer, enlarging our social media presence, the creation of possible Preserves calendars or post cards to sell and, and as always, help with Bay Day or special events. We are currently beginning our planning for our upcoming February Bay Day. If you have any questions/comments or would be interested in volunteering to assist us with our upcoming February Bay Day or any of the Friends’ projects described above, please let us know at\nstjosephbaypreserve@gmail.com\nRichard Trahan, President\nFriends of Saint Joseph Bay Preserves\nThe Friends of St. Joseph Bay Preserves, Inc., is a non-profit Citizen Support Organization established in 2003 to protect and preserve one of the most ecologically significant areas in the Southeastern United States, and to support the St. Joseph Bay Buffer Preserve and St. Joseph Bay Aquatic Preserve.\n.entry-content\nFall Fest\nfestival\nFestival of Trees\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nJoin us for our Fall Fest in the Preserve – Saturday, November 16th, 2024\nNovember 4, 2024\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\nFall Fest in the Preserve\nJoin Us Saturday, November 16\nth\n, 2024, for our Fall Festival in the heart of the St. Joseph Bay State Buffer Preserve.\n3pm – 6pm EST\nFriends of St. Joseph Bay Preserves present an afternoon of outdoor fun and activities including hay rides through the preserve, interpretive hiking, scavenger hunt, face painting, hot apple cider,  campfire with marshmallow roast, walking tacos and more … no admission fee!\nLive Music Throughout the Afternoon: The “mixed acoustic” sounds of Marilyn and Tyler Freeman, …. “a little old country, blue grass, and rock n’ roll”.\nThe Fall Festival events are located within the Buffer Preserve on Treasure Road.

Residents and visitors enjoyed extensive, pristine seagrass beds and clear bay waters. Summertime recreational scallop harvesting contributed greatly to the local economy. Seagrass beds in the bay are dominated by turtle grass which also provide food for abundant green sea turtles. The scallop fishery has become depleted in recent years, algal blooms are more frequent, and the acreage of seagrass beds has decreased. An overabundance of sea urchins (\nLytechinus spp.\n) continues to destroy turtle grass beds through overgrazing. This project will jump start natural recovery of seagrass by installing exclosures over grazed areas to allow seagrasses to grow back without sea urchin grazing pressure. In addition, sea urchin roundups, public outreach events, will involve citizens to remove sea urchins from active grazing fronts. The animals will be released in deeper areas of the bay at a distance from grazed areas.\n.entry-content\nsea urchins\nseagrass\nst joseph bay\nurchin roundup\nurchins\n#post-6315\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nFestival of Trees at The Joe Center for the Arts, through Dec. 12, 2021\nDecember 4, 2021\nMarch Ard\n.entry-header\nSee the Friends of St. Joseph Bay Preserves Christmas tree at the\nFestival of Trees, at The Joe Center for the Arts\n!  Many organizations and businesses have decorated beautiful and original trees for this display.  Vote for your favorite!  Plus there are special events including a Silent Auction.  For the schedule, see https://thejoecenterforthearts41.wildapricot.org/\n201 Reid Avenue, Port Saint Joe/ Wednesday-Saturday, 11-6, except Thanksgiving weekend (closing at 3 on Weds., reopening on Sat.)\nFriends of the Preserves 2021 Festival of Trees\n.entry-content\n#post-4137\nPosts navigation\n1\n2\n…\n4\nNext →\n.navigation\n#content\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nSummer Art Camp Visit, Wednesday, June 24th, 2025\nJune 24, 2025\nTim Nelson\n.entry-header\nWe here at the St. Joseph Bay State Buffer Preserve had the opportunity to host a summer camp this past Wednesday!

Residents and visitors enjoyed extensive, pristine seagrass beds and clear bay waters. Summertime recreational scallop harvesting contributed greatly to the local economy. Seagrass beds in the bay are dominated by turtle grass which also provide food for abundant green sea turtles. The scallop fishery has become depleted in recent years, algal blooms are more frequent, and the acreage of seagrass beds has decreased. An overabundance of sea urchins (\nLytechinus spp.\n) continues to destroy turtle grass beds through overgrazing. This project will jump start natural recovery of seagrass by installing exclosures over grazed areas to allow seagrasses to grow back without sea urchin grazing pressure. In addition, sea urchin roundups, public outreach events, will involve citizens to remove sea urchins from active grazing fronts. The animals will be released in deeper areas of the bay at a distance from grazed areas.\n.entry-content\nsea urchins\nseagrass\nst joseph bay\nurchin roundup\nurchins\nActivities\n,\nEvents\nFestival of Trees at The Joe Center for the Arts, through Dec. 12, 2021\nDecember 4, 2021\nMarch Ard\n.entry-header\nSee the Friends of St. Joseph Bay Preserves Christmas tree at the\nFestival of Trees, at The Joe Center for the Arts\n!  Many organizations and businesses have decorated beautiful and original trees for this display.  Vote for your favorite!  Plus there are special events including a Silent Auction.  For the schedule, see https://thejoecenterforthearts41.wildapricot.org/\n201 Reid Avenue, Port Saint Joe/ Wednesday-Saturday, 11-6, except Thanksgiving weekend (closing at 3 on Weds., reopening on Sat.)\nFriends of the Preserves 2021 Festival of Trees\n.entry-content",
