Since becoming the 27th state in 1845, Florida has become one of the most recognized leaders in beer, wine, and spirits — both in quality and in production.  When visiting, you will be pleased to find one of the largest selections of Florida craft beer, wines, and spirits.\nOwners Scott and Kristin have lived in the Davenport area for more than 15 years.  Sharing a passion and taste for craft beer, their travels across the country have always included visits to area breweries, and so their goal became bringing all the great flavors they found, home to Polk County.  Through their combined 35 years in the service industry, Scott and Kristin aim to provide the best experience and widest selection under one roof, even expanding to brewing their own Tap House exclusive beers.\n.four-columns - sidebar\nmfn_hook_content_after\nmfn_hook_content_after\n#Footer\nCopyrights\n© 2025 1845 Taphouse.
