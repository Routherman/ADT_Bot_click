We take our craft seriously and know that the care and attention we put into our brewing practices shows in the end product. PAW beers have racked up multiple awards including 13 medals in the Best Florida Beer Competition, and even a Great American Beer Festival Silver medal for Milk Bone Sweet Stout!\nWe have more taps than a dog has toes – more than\n30 in our tasting room\n. They consist of PAW’s core brands and a rotating selection of pilot batches of experimental craft beers, keg treatments, seasonal offerings and (typically) one hard cider.\nVisit us today.\nBeer-to-go in the PAW tap room:\n1/6 & 1/2 bbl Kegs\n16, 19.2 & 32 oz Crowlers\n32 & 64 oz Growlers\n1888 Russian Imperial Stout – 22 oz bottles\nBarrel Aged 1888 Russian Imperial Stout – 22 oz bottles\n16 oz 4 Packs of select PAW beers\n12 oz 6 Packs of select PAW beers\nA variety of select 22oz bottles also available in the tap room!\nBeer Descriptions\nHere are just a few of our award-winning brews available in the tap room:\n1888 – Russian Imperial Stout\n2017/ 2021/ 2022 Best Florida Beer Competition: Gold Medal “Sweet/ Strong Stout”\n2018 & 2023 Best Florida Beer Competition: Silver Medal “\nSweet/ Strong Stout”\n2020 Best Florida Beer Competition: Bronze Medal “\nSweet/ Strong Stout”\n10.5% ABV | 108 IBU | 110 SRM\nJune 8\nth\n1888\n, the day in which the first train pulled into the last stop in southern Pinellas County. That train arrived carrying empty freight cars and one passenger on the railroad built by Peter Demens. Eventually, the city that arose around that stop was named after his birthplace of St. Petersburg, Russia. To honor the arrival of that first train we present this beer which boasts bold roast barley, chocolate, toffee, dark fruit and coffee flavors big enough to satisfy even the most demanding aristocrats.\nMilk Bone – Sweet Stout\n2017 Great American Beer Festival: Silver Medal\n5% ABV | 25 IBU | 45 SRM\nOne of our best sellers since we’ve opened. This milk stout (AKA sweet stout) is brewed with lactose in the boil which gives a residual sweetness and medium mouthfeel. You will notice notes of chocolate, coffee and slight toffee in the aroma and flavor. If you like café con leche, you’ll love Milk Bone!\nHarold’s – St Pete Style Lager\n5% ABV | 27 IBU | 3.5 SRM\nThe ode to our building’s namesake is our go-to, easy drinking beer for any occasion. ‘Harold’ used to run an auto body repair shop where we now brew our beer. If he was still around, we’re sure this would be his favorite beer. Loosely based on the German Kolsch style, we use a proprietary fermentation process to produce a flavorful beer that finishes smooth and clean. Pilsner base malt provides a pleasant malt backbone and the German Hallertauer hops balance out the sweetness with a slight herbal note. This beer is a favorite around the brewery due to its simplicity and approachability! Watch for special treatments on tap in the Tasting Room, including Strawberry/Banana, Peach, and Coffee Harold’s.\nPiddle Pils – Pilsner\n4.9% ABV | 39 IBU | 3 SRM\nThis beer is our take on the German Pilsner style. It’s slightly more flavorful and hop forward than our Harold’s lager. Our exclusive “St Pete Style” fermenting and lagering process makes this beer smooth and sessionable, but never boring.\nPrice’s Horchata – Cinnamon/ Vanilla Rice Ale\n2020 Best Florida Beer Competition: Gold Medal “Herb/ Spice Beer\n“\n5.8% ABV |  20 IBU | 3 SRM\nWhy Price’s Horchata? First off, Price is our long time friend and home brewer and he’s responsible for the recipe behind this delicious beer. It’s a unique beer that uses rice and barley malt in the grist, lactose in the boil, and loads of vanilla beans and cinnamon sticks in the fermenter. Hop additions are kept to a minimum to let the spices shine. The result is a light and refreshing brew akin to it’s ancient roots. This is a seasonal offering.\nSit – Amber Ale\n5.3% ABV | 29 IBU | 15 SRM\nWhen we wrote the recipe for this beer, our goal was not to create another IPA in a different color, but to offer a sessionable beer balanced more on the malty side. We use “citrusy” American hops in moderation so the malt can come through. Sit!… and enjoy.\nChill Hill – IPA\n4.9% ABV | 40 IBU | 5 SRM\nThe little brother of Thrill Hill! Being a bit more restrained in maltiness and ABV, you can’t beat beers like this for day drinking, so kick back and enjoy the chill ride with this brew.\nPuppy Love – New England Style IPA\n7% ABV |  0 IBU | 4 SRM\nWe love these New England style IPAs for their big juicy flavor, in your face hop aroma and we love them for their low bitterness turbidity. We brew our Puppy Love with our favorite combo of jucifiers and hazifiers! We hope you love drinking Puppy Love as much as we love making it.\nOff The Leash – American IPA\n7% ABV | 50 IBU | 8 SRM\nOur goal with this American IPA is balance. We use loads of hops for big hop aroma and flavor, but also just enough malt to balance out the bitterness. We don’t believe, “he who dies with the highest IBU’s (International Bittering Units) wins.”\nThrill Hill – Double IPA\n2020 Best Florida Beer Competition: Bronze Medal “Imperial IPA\n“\n8.4% ABV |  82 IBU | 6 SRM\nThis over the top Double IPA is named after a famous St Pete “Hill” and it is a hop lover’s dream. It’s light in color but big and bold in flavor. To achieve the big juicy hop flavor, we load up the whirlpool with lots of Chinook hops. The big hop nose comes from dry hopping with lots of American and New Zealand hops. The slightly sweet malt takes a back seat letting the hop flavors shine and a dryer finish leaves a pleasant bitterness that begs for another sip. Yes, tons of hops were sacrificed in the making of this beer, but we think you’ll agree, it was worth it. When your mouth is ready for a thrill, order a Thrill Hill.\nPAW Festbier – Oktoberfest\n2024 Best Florida Beer Oktoberfest Competition: Bronze Medal\n5.7% ABV | 28 IBU | 9 SRM\nThis malty copper colored beer is brewed in Germany during the summer and released for the Fall Oktoberfest celebration. Here at PAW, we love this style so much, we’ve been known to brew it year round. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, come raise a pint of PAW Festbier. Prost!\nSmoke Dog – Smoked Red Ale\n2020 & 2025 Best Florida Beer Competition: Silver Medal “Smoked Beer\n“\n6% ABV |  21 IBU | 16 SRM\nSmoke Dog is a malty Red Ale brewed with just the right amount of German Beechwood Smoked malt. Some people say it tastes like bacon.. how can you beat that!\nAberdeen – Scotch Ale\n9.4% ABV | 53 IBU | 25 SRM\nNamed after one of our furry friends, the Aberdeen Terrier, Aberdeen Scotch Ale is a full-bodied Ale with a very creamy mouthfeel. It is packed full of flavors that range from dried fruits and caramel to light biscuit undertones. With all those flavors coming through, this beer definitely doesn’t let you forget that it is, in fact, a very malt forward beer that’s balanced and not overwhelming.\nPomeranian Porter – Baltic Porter\n8.5% ABV | 49 IBU | 35 SRM\nSometimes known as Palmeranian, this is our St. Pete interpretation of a European beer. Pomeranian Porter is a bold and robust Baltic-style Porter. At first, you’ll notice notes of nuts, toffee, figs, and licorice all backed by a very nice medium carbonation and a subtle dry finish.\nSchwarzhound – German Black Lager\n2019 Best Florida Beer Competition: Gold Medal “\nEuropean Lager”\n2023 Best Florida Beer\nOktoberfest Open\n: Gold Medal “Dark\nEuropean Lager”\n5% ABV | 25 IBU | 28 SRM\nDon’t be afraid of the dark. Unlike most black beers, like American Stouts which tend to be more roasty and bitter, this German-style Schwarzbier is very balanced and sessionable. Subtle hints of unsweetened chocolate and coffee keep it interesting, and restrained bittering hop additions keep the balance in check. Schwarzhound is all bark and no bite!\nStay\n5.2% ABV | 0 IBU\nTypically the first command you teach to every young puppy. If you appreciate Craft Beer but have never tried ours, this would be a good beer to start with. Lots of late kettle additions and plenty of dry hoping provide huge American hop flavor and a wonderful fruity and slightly floral aroma. Don’t be fooled into thinking all that hop goodness will leave a bitter mess in your mouth, this beer is balanced, finishes clean and crisp and is a joy to quaff. So be good, Stay.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come\nvisit us\n, and try a flight of beers in our tasting room.\nLooking for fresh, local, award winning Craft Beer for your bar or restaurant?

It’s light in color but big and bold in flavor. To achieve the big juicy hop flavor, we load up the whirlpool with lots of Chinook hops. The big hop nose comes from dry hopping with lots of American and New Zealand hops. The slightly sweet malt takes a back seat letting the hop flavors shine and a dryer finish leaves a pleasant bitterness that begs for another sip. Yes, tons of hops were sacrificed in the making of this beer, but we think you’ll agree, it was worth it. When your mouth is ready for a thrill, order a Thrill Hill.\nPAW Festbier – Oktoberfest\n2024 Best Florida Beer Oktoberfest Competition: Bronze Medal\n5.7% ABV | 28 IBU | 9 SRM\nThis malty copper colored beer is brewed in Germany during the summer and released for the Fall Oktoberfest celebration. Here at PAW, we love this style so much, we’ve been known to brew it year round. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, come raise a pint of PAW Festbier. Prost!\nSmoke Dog – Smoked Red Ale\n2020 & 2025 Best Florida Beer Competition: Silver Medal “Smoked Beer\n“\n6% ABV |  21 IBU | 16 SRM\nSmoke Dog is a malty Red Ale brewed with just the right amount of German Beechwood Smoked malt. Some people say it tastes like bacon.. how can you beat that!\nAberdeen – Scotch Ale\n9.4% ABV | 53 IBU | 25 SRM\nNamed after one of our furry friends, the Aberdeen Terrier, Aberdeen Scotch Ale is a full-bodied Ale with a very creamy mouthfeel. It is packed full of flavors that range from dried fruits and caramel to light biscuit undertones. With all those flavors coming through, this beer definitely doesn’t let you forget that it is, in fact, a very malt forward beer that’s balanced and not overwhelming.\nPomeranian Porter – Baltic Porter\n8.5% ABV | 49 IBU | 35 SRM\nSometimes known as Palmeranian, this is our St. Pete interpretation of a European beer. Pomeranian Porter is a bold and robust Baltic-style Porter. At first, you’ll notice notes of nuts, toffee, figs, and licorice all backed by a very nice medium carbonation and a subtle dry finish.\nSchwarzhound – German Black Lager\n2019 Best Florida Beer Competition: Gold Medal “\nEuropean Lager”\n2023 Best Florida Beer\nOktoberfest Open\n: Gold Medal “Dark\nEuropean Lager”\n5% ABV | 25 IBU | 28 SRM\nDon’t be afraid of the dark. Unlike most black beers, like American Stouts which tend to be more roasty and bitter, this German-style Schwarzbier is very balanced and sessionable. Subtle hints of unsweetened chocolate and coffee keep it interesting, and restrained bittering hop additions keep the balance in check. Schwarzhound is all bark and no bite!\nStay\n5.2% ABV | 0 IBU\nTypically the first command you teach to every young puppy. If you appreciate Craft Beer but have never tried ours, this would be a good beer to start with. Lots of late kettle additions and plenty of dry hoping provide huge American hop flavor and a wonderful fruity and slightly floral aroma. Don’t be fooled into thinking all that hop goodness will leave a bitter mess in your mouth, this beer is balanced, finishes clean and crisp and is a joy to quaff. So be good, Stay.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come\nvisit us\n, and try a flight of beers in our tasting room.\nLooking for fresh, local, award winning Craft Beer for your bar or restaurant?

That train arrived carrying empty freight cars and one passenger on the railroad built by Peter Demens. Eventually, the city that arose around that stop was named after his birthplace of St. Petersburg, Russia. To honor the arrival of that first train we present this beer which boasts bold roast barley, chocolate, toffee, dark fruit and coffee flavors big enough to satisfy even the most demanding aristocrats.\nMilk Bone – Sweet Stout\n2017 Great American Beer Festival: Silver Medal\n5% ABV | 25 IBU | 45 SRM\nOne of our best sellers since we’ve opened. This milk stout (AKA sweet stout) is brewed with lactose in the boil which gives a residual sweetness and medium mouthfeel. You will notice notes of chocolate, coffee and slight toffee in the aroma and flavor. If you like café con leche, you’ll love Milk Bone!\nHarold’s – St Pete Style Lager\n5% ABV | 27 IBU | 3.5 SRM\nThe ode to our building’s namesake is our go-to, easy drinking beer for any occasion. ‘Harold’ used to run an auto body repair shop where we now brew our beer. If he was still around, we’re sure this would be his favorite beer. Loosely based on the German Kolsch style, we use a proprietary fermentation process to produce a flavorful beer that finishes smooth and clean. Pilsner base malt provides a pleasant malt backbone and the German Hallertauer hops balance out the sweetness with a slight herbal note. This beer is a favorite around the brewery due to its simplicity and approachability! Watch for special treatments on tap in the Tasting Room, including Strawberry/Banana, Peach, and Coffee Harold’s.\nPiddle Pils – Pilsner\n4.9% ABV | 39 IBU | 3 SRM\nThis beer is our take on the German Pilsner style. It’s slightly more flavorful and hop forward than our Harold’s lager. Our exclusive “St Pete Style” fermenting and lagering process makes this beer smooth and sessionable, but never boring.\nPrice’s Horchata – Cinnamon/ Vanilla Rice Ale\n2020 Best Florida Beer Competition: Gold Medal “Herb/ Spice Beer\n“\n5.8% ABV |  20 IBU | 3 SRM\nWhy Price’s Horchata? First off, Price is our long time friend and home brewer and he’s responsible for the recipe behind this delicious beer. It’s a unique beer that uses rice and barley malt in the grist, lactose in the boil, and loads of vanilla beans and cinnamon sticks in the fermenter. Hop additions are kept to a minimum to let the spices shine. The result is a light and refreshing brew akin to it’s ancient roots. This is a seasonal offering.\nSit – Amber Ale\n5.3% ABV | 29 IBU | 15 SRM\nWhen we wrote the recipe for this beer, our goal was not to create another IPA in a different color, but to offer a sessionable beer balanced more on the malty side. We use “citrusy” American hops in moderation so the malt can come through. Sit!… and enjoy.\nChill Hill – IPA\n4.9% ABV | 40 IBU | 5 SRM\nThe little brother of Thrill Hill! Being a bit more restrained in maltiness and ABV, you can’t beat beers like this for day drinking, so kick back and enjoy the chill ride with this brew.\nPuppy Love – New England Style IPA\n7% ABV |  0 IBU | 4 SRM\nWe love these New England style IPAs for their big juicy flavor, in your face hop aroma and we love them for their low bitterness turbidity. We brew our Puppy Love with our favorite combo of jucifiers and hazifiers! We hope you love drinking Puppy Love as much as we love making it.\nOff The Leash – American IPA\n7% ABV | 50 IBU | 8 SRM\nOur goal with this American IPA is balance. We use loads of hops for big hop aroma and flavor, but also just enough malt to balance out the bitterness. We don’t believe, “he who dies with the highest IBU’s (International Bittering Units) wins.”\nThrill Hill – Double IPA\n2020 Best Florida Beer Competition: Bronze Medal “Imperial IPA\n“\n8.4% ABV |  82 IBU | 6 SRM\nThis over the top Double IPA is named after a famous St Pete “Hill” and it is a hop lover’s dream.
