Founded in 1929, The Players is celebrating 94 years of bringing the community to the stage. Being the second oldest arts organization in Sarasota and the oldest performing arts organization, The Players is proud to have fostered the budding performing arts scene that has grown into a thriving, theatre-loving community.\nIn the last nine decades, The Players has become a staple for community members to learn, grow and experience live theatre. The Players Studio teaches all ages and abilities, with no student turned away for their inability to pay thanks to our Building Better Grownups Scholarship Fund. Students can take classes in acting, singing, dance, sewing, directing, as well as specialized workshops and camps. The performing arts help students develop crucial life skills and increases self-esteem and confidence, as well as problem solving and critical thinking. Over 300 students come through The Players Studio each year.\nNo other venue in town allows patrons to potentially see their friends, relatives, and neighbors fulfill their dream of performing on stage. We are truly local performances, by local performers. We give people a second family, a place to learn about themselves, to hone their skills, to meet new friends and to express themselves creatively.\nOur Mission Statement\nEntertain, educate, and engage the community through high quality live theatre.\nValues statement\nArtistic Excellence\nKnowledge\nInclusivity\nIntegrity\nPassion\nAuthenticity\nValues statement\nArtistic Excellence\nKnowledge\nInclusivity\nIntegrity\nPassion\nAuthenticity\nStudio & Mailing\n1400 Blvd. of the Arts, Suite 200\nSarasota, FL 34236\n941.552.8879\nPerformance Venue & Box Office\nThe Crossings at Siesta Key\n3501 South Tamiami Trail, Suite 1130\nSarasota, FL 34239\nBoxOffice@ThePlayers.org\nBox Office Telephone: 941.365.2494\nIcons-facebook\nIcons-instagram\nShows\nCalendar\nAll Shows\nSubscriptions\nSeating Chart\nSupport Us\nDonate\nOur Sponsors\nFundraisers\nStudio\nEducation\nClasses and Workshops\nRegister for Classes\nPerformance Groups\nAbout Us\nDirections & Hours\nNews / Blog\nMeet Our Staff\nStudio Faculty\nBoard of Trustees\nOur History\nJoin Us\nAuditions\nCareers\nVolunteer With Us",
