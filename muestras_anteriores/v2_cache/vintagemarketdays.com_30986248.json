      "text": "Tonya & Kyle\nI’m from a small town in east-central Indiana—a true Midwestern girl! Growing up with my three sisters, my family frequently attended and participated in auctions, garage sales, flea markets, and antique shows. I loved the hustle and bustle of those events. I began my career in retail, transitioned into corporate staffing, and have spent the past 18 years in healthcare management. Along the way, I discovered that customer service and project management are my true passions. When combined with my love for all things vintage and repurposed, it led me to explore opportunities where these interests could come together. Vintage Market Days® was a natural fit—the events are a full experience the whole family can enjoy!\nOnce I discovered the opportunity to bring a Vintage Market Days® event to the area, I jumped at the chance—and I haven’t looked back since. I’m blessed with a supportive husband and two wonderful boys who have stood beside me every step of the way on this exciting journey into the world of Vintage Market Days®.\nCan’t wait to see you there! xoxo, Tonya",

By 2013, Vintage Market Days® was being \"licensed\" to several vendors who wanted to take Vintage Market Days® to other communities. By 2014, Vintage Market Days® had grown to 8 event locations in 5 states. It was at this point that VMD™ became a franchise business. As of January 2022, Vintage Market Days® has more than 60 franchises in 26 states across the US. We love nothing more than bringing the Vintage experience to you®. I hope you will have the opportunity to join us at one of our events this year!\n- Dianna Brown\nBecome a Franchise!\nBecome a Vendor!",
