The Board adopted policy and procedures for the Safety Program in 1993. With this, came a commitment by the Board to have safety in the workplace for all employees a top priority. The commitment and awareness by the Board has had a positive effect on all employees and has drastically reduced workplace accidents. The Safety Director reports directly to the County Manager.\nThe Board also created a Drug Free Workplace Policy that was revised in 2005 that has guidelines for random drug testing and Commercial Drivers License (CDL) random drug testing. CDL random drug testing is conducted quarterly and random drug testing is conducted either annually or whenever the County Manager deems it necessary.  Drug tests are conducted on all employees post accident. The director has the overall responsibility of the safety program as prescribed by the policies set forth by the County Commissioners. The Safety Director has the authority to administer the policy and program working through the various lines of management in the County.\nThis department also conducts facility inspections for all County buildings and recommends corrective or preventive measures. The Safety Director investigates an accident that requires medical attention as soon as possible. An accident that does not require medical attention is also investigated and a report is placed in employee safety file. These reports are compiled to study frequency of accidents.\nThis department supervises the procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment and other safety devices. This department oversees all training that is required by OSHA, County policies and any training that employees request. This Department assists in job placement of employees able to return to work after serious or disabling injuries.\nA safety manual is issued to all newly hired employees.\n(PDF) View the safety manual\n(PDF) Get a copy of the accident-incident claim form\nInstanceEndEditable\nInstanceBeginEditable name=\"RightColumn Content\"\nInstanceEndEditable\nBack to Top\nCopyright ©\nColumbia County.

One definition of a health related mosquito problem is the ability of a mosquito to transmit infectious diseases. In Florida, this definition includes only mosquitoes that spread dog heartworm, St. Louis Encephalitis and Eastern Equine Encephalitis. However, any mosquito that bites or annoys people can be considered a health problem, particularly for individuals that are allergic to mosquito bites or which suffer from entomophobia, (i.e. A fear of insects).\nHabitat/Source Reduction\nMosquito habitats and ways individuals can protect themselves from mosquito attack. Source reduction is usually the most effective of the techniques available and is accomplished by eliminating mosquito breeding sites.\nContainers\nThis can be a simple as properly discarding old containers which hold water capable of producing Aedes aegypti, A.e. albopictus or Culex spp. Containers such as flower pots, cans and tires are excellent habitats for mosquitoes to breed. A container breeding mosquito problem can be solved by properly disposing of such items, covering them or tipping them over to ensure that they do not collect water.\nWater\nSmall man-made ponds, storm water or waste water retention areas are also excellent breeding habitats, effective control include period drainage, providing deep water sanctuary for predator / larvivorious fish, minimizing emergent and standing vegetation and maintaining steep banks.\nSwamps\nEnvironmental laws greatly restrict habitat manipulation in these areas, making permanent control here difficult, which can produce Culex, Anopheles, and Culiseta species of mosquitoes.\nTemporarily Flooded Locations\nPastures and agricultural lands are enormous mosquito producers, frequently generating huge broods of mosquitoes, (Aedes, Psorophora and Culex). Improved drainage is one effective tool to generate source reduction.\nMosquito Control Treatments Provided\nAdulticiding\nColumbia County provides for spraying the county using various chemicals to kill adult mosquitoes, and are generally applied using a truck mounted ULV spray unit.\nLarviciding\nColumbia County provides for the chemical treatment of larval mosquitoes (either I-IV Instar) by applying chemicals to roadside ditches, swales, retention ponds, treatment ponds and small bodies of water, man-made ponds. Most currently used larvicides, when applied properly, are efficacious and environmentally safe, both to aquatic animals and humans.\nSpraying Requirements\nFlorida Statues on mosquito surveillance are concerned only with the monitoring of adults. According to these statues, before adulticides can be applied, a monitoring program must detect an increase in the population above a predetermined baseline. Or by using a techniques known as Landing Rates, landing rates are determined using this technique comprises a count of the number of mosquitoes that land on a person in a given amount of time. This is useful for evaluating activity for day biting, and container breeding mosquitoes, which are common around homes. Also used is telephonic service request, which citizens can\ncall the Mosquito Control Department at 386-752-6050\nto log a complaint and request mosquito control services.\nInstanceEndEditable\nInstanceBeginEditable name=\"RightColumn Content\"\nDownload\nSolid Waste Franchise Collection Application Form\nQuestions?
