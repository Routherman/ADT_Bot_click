I would definitely recommend them for any events you’re having in the St. Augustine area! They made the planning process super easy and had a variety of food and drink options. The day of the service was excellent and all the food was delicious. The private room is also very nice with a lot of charm. We loved our rehearsal dinner and would definitely work with Chatsworth Pub again!” Elizabeth\n“We had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the Chatsworth Pub and everything was wonderful. We rented out the entire pub for two hours which was a lot of fun for our guests. Marco was so responsive during the planning process and was there on our event night to make sure everything ran smoothly. The food and service were great, we even came back the next night after our wedding to keep celebrating! Highly recommend!” Meghan\n“The Chatsworth Pub is an absolutely perfect place to host a post wedding (or pre wedding) brunch! I had popped in on one of my many trips to St Augustine to plan our wedding and loved the ambiance, cocktails & food! We decided to rent out the entire space for a post wedding brunch and it was amazing! From the food, to the service to the BOTTOMLESS mimosas, there was no better place to close out our wedding weekend! Everyone loves a good brunch, but their brunch was really to die for. It is a standard package/meal that included a waffle, egg souffle & home fries, and while we knew it would all be good, it was actually AMAZING! Every single one of our 75 guests LOVED the food and went as far as to ask the chef what in the world he did to his eggs to make them so yummy! I would highly recommend for any event or just popping in for a cocktail & snack! Such a great spot in a perfect location! Thank you Chatsworth for being wonderful!” Emily\n“Chatsworth Pub is the perfect place for a group function, especially a rehearsal dinner! We had my son and daughter-in-law’s rehearsal dinner here and let me just say, we have no regrets on our choice! From the staff, to the food, to the atmosphere, this place is top notch. Our group of 30 had a\nwonderful time\n, and everyone absolutely raved about it. We went with a happy hour style event, since our rehearsal was early in the day next door at the White Room, and the set up was\ngreat with several small tables and random comfy chairs that allowed for a lot of moving around and socializing. And the dessert table with bite sized goodies was to die for! Our event coordinator Katie was always quick to answer my million email questions and phone calls leading up to the big day, and on the day of, she kept the event running smoothly, consulting me regarding any changes we may have wanted with the time line once we began. And as I said, all of the staff was absolutely amazing; there were no empty glasses or plates the entire time we were there! The next day, the groomsmen and dads even returned there before the wedding and were still treated to five star service. AMAZING PLACE!\n” Facebook Review by G. Roessel August\n“Katie helped me plan an event for our work murder mystery dinner party.  It was perfection.  Katie was extremely prompt, thorough, and was there every step of the way. The food was set up prompt and servers passed the food around and took drink orders.  We continue to use the Chatsworth as a venue for our work events and personal events.  You cannot go wrong with choose Chatsworth.  Thank you Katie and Chatsworth for a memorable event.\nINQUIRE NOW\nThe Tea Room for Private Events or Corporate Meetings\nThe Tea Room is the perfect setting tastefully decorated for your Rehearsal Dinner, Rehearsal Cocktail Party or Dinner, Rehearsal Dinner + Welcome Party (a favorite), Pre or Post\nWedding Gatherings, Afternoon High Tea or High Tea Party, Bridal or Baby Shower, Engagement Party, Birthday Party or any celebration.  The Tea Room also is a great meeting space for a Corporate group to have an all day meeting followed by cocktails in the pub and dinner afterwards.  Any group can book the Tea Room for up to 40 guests comfortably or the entire Pub for groups up to 65 guests for a sit down event or over 80 for a heavy hors d’oeuvres and cocktails.  Something that has been popular lately has been booking the entire pub for a Rehearsal Dinner followed by a Welcome Party.  The best way to see our events is by going to our\nInstagram Page\nand viewing Highlights of our Stories that we have posted.
