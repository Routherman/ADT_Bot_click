We began production on a 1bbl brewing system in 2016, and produced between 100-150 barrels of beer annually. Brian Detweiler and Francis Camosse became owners to join Tim and Jason, and opened its current location in 2018 “The Mothership”. Now producing just under 2,000 barrels annually, 3rd Planet was among the Brewers Association “50 Fastest Growing Breweries” in 2019. A significant portion of our production goes to our taproom, which consistently ranks among the 20 busiest by volume in the state of Florida. Remaining consistent with our goal to be “Rooted in the community,” our taproom and outdoor area is truly a community gathering place for visitors of all ages.\nThe quality of our product and service from grain to glass is a major factor in our success. We seek out individuals who are passionate about beer and appreciate its role as a beverage that brings people together. In 2022, we were awarded First Runner-Up for Best Large Brewery in the Best Florida Beer Championship. We also are consistently awarded “Finest Craft Brewery” and “Finest Craft Beer Selection” in the Northwest Florida Daily News “Finest of the Emerald Coast”. Additionally, we were awarded “Best Brewery” by Emerald Coast Magazine’s “Best of the Emerald Coast” in 2022.\nLocated in Niceville, 3rd Planet is just a few miles from Destin and the famous beaches of the Emerald Coast. We are also situated in a military community near Eglin Air Force Base, Hurlburt Field, and Duke Field. The public schools in Okaloosa County consistently rank among the best in the State of Florida. Niceville is a great community to raise a family, and 3rd Planet loves serving as a place for the town to come together.\nOur Team\nTim & Sue McCool\nFounder & Co-owner\nJason & Rachel Doster\nFounder & Co-owner\nBrian Detweiler\nMothership Head Brewer & Co-owner\nFrancis Camosse\nMothership Taproom Manager & Co-owner\nTodd Schrag\nReservations Coordinator & Taproom Lead\nAbout 3rd Planet Brewing\nSlide 1 of 4\nSlide 2 of 4\nSlide 3 of 4\nSlide 4 of 4\nhero gallery paused, press to play images slides\nPlaying hero gallery, press to pause images slides\nFounded in 2015 by two Air Force veterans Tim McCool and Jason Doster, 3rd Planet has grown from a small neighborhood watering hole to a significant contributor in the Florida Panhandle beer scene.
