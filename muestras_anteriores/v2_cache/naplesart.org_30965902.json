As an art historian trained in 19th-century European academic art and knowledgeable in Pan-American modern and contemporary art, he has curated and organized more than 100 exhibitions, most notably\nSurrealism in Belgium: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (2014), The Duchamp Family of Artists (2014), and Museum to Scale 1/7 (2015).\nOriginally from Brussels, Verpoorten moved to New York City in 2000, where he held curatorial and directorial roles at the Dahesh Museum of Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. From 2009 to 2012 he was Cultural Attaché for the Delegation of Flanders (Belgium) to the U.S.A. in New York.\nBefore joining Naples Art Institute, he was Director and Chief Curator of Artis—Naples, The Baker Museum for seven years, earning the appreciation, support, and friendship of the Southwest Florida community through unique, world-class exhibitions, tireless advocacy for the permanent collection, and judicious acquisitions.\nHe propelled the institution to a new level of excellence and substantially grew and advanced the appreciation of the museum’s collections. He expanded the collection by securing major acquisitions from the late Olga Hirshhorn and from Charlotte and Paul Corddry. His research on The Baker Museum’s collection culminated with the publication of their first permanent collection book.\nIn 2019, Verpoorten secured a long-term loan of six iconic paintings by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte from a private collection. The addition of these outstanding works with remarkable provenance substantially raised the museum’s profile nationally and internationally.\nMr. Verpoorten attended the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Belgium, earning dual master’s degrees in art history and cultural studies.\nfrank.verpoorten@naplesart.org\n|\n239.262.6517\nJack Decloedt\nSenior Director of Operations\nBringing his experience in managing several businesses to Naples Art Institute, Jack strives for operational excellence and financial stability in support of the Institute’s plan to become Naples’ cultural and educational focal point for the visual arts.\nOriginally from Belgium, Jack started and ran the European office for an American systems engineering and manufacturing company, then transferred to its headquarters in Colorado, eventually becoming CEO.
