Most recently, it was the local watering hole, the Karl Reef, where locals came for drinks and live entertainment for nearly 20 years. Now two families have come together to breathe new life into the historic landmark, and since the summer of 2019, Bourbon on Main has been a hotspot for the community. Named both for the Louisiana theme it represents and the spirit they carry, BOM (as it is often shortened to) has over 100 bourbons showcased on their bar.Â Friends for over a decade, the families decided to collaborate to create a new concept that would contribute to the growth of the downtown. Bringing a variety of skills from their different backgrounds, both families continue to create a place that they can keep in the family and offer their children in the future. Today, Bourbon on Main offers live music and a full bar, as well as a Florida and New Orleans fusion menu. Diners can enjoy their meals on the large patio overlooking Nebraska avenue or enjoy games on the upstairs deck above the bar.\nBOMÂ LOCATION\nVisit us!\n6307 Grand Blvd\nNew Port Richey, FL 34652\nHave a question?\ncall today\nCall BOM\nÂ @\n727-645-5801\nEmail BOM\nÂ @\nthebom0816@yahoo.com\nNeed a\nreservation\n?\nCall BOM @\n(727) 645-5801\nVisit DowntownNewPortRichey.com",
