The all volunteer management\nteam helps to keep the maintenance fees among the lowest in the state. The approximately 18 acres of\nland provides plenty of space for large lots and a park like setting with plenty of tropical trees and bushes.\nA Fishing Pier built in 2002, a Recreational Hall that was built in 2006 are among\nthe amenities enjoyed by the residents and their visitors. Our park is close to shopping, many fine restaurants\nand all the diverse facilities and activities that the Charlotte Harbor area is renowned for.
