A 7% sales tax is applied on all food, beverage and the banquet service charge. All additional charges incurred during the event will be charged to the credit card on file unless otherwise specified. If your group is tax exempt you need to provide us your DR-14 form when sending in the contract.\nWhat are the menu selections for private events?\nMenus must be selected ten business days prior to your event. If menu selections are not received by this deadline, chef’s choice will apply. Guest counts dropping below 15 guests at least five days prior may be subject to chef’s choice of menu.\nDoes Rooftop accommodate dietary restrictions for private events?\nWe are happy to accommodate a wide range of special dietary needs and restrictions. Prior to signing off on your Banquet Event Order, please specify restrictions with your Event Manager.\nWhat are Rooftop’s policies on decorations for private events?\nEvent Sections are available one hour prior to your event to allow for decorating. If you need additional time, a $150 charge will apply for each additional hour or fraction. Decorators must follow the decoration policies, Absolutely no tape on wall papered walls, no staples or nails on any interior materials. NO Glitter, Confetti or Wax Candles are allowed to be used. In the event that such materials are used which cause damage, a damage fee will be applied toward the final bill. We are not responsible for any items left after an event and do not guarantee the security of those items.\nWhat are the parking accommodations for private events?\nValet services are available, either hosted by your group, or paid by any individuals who use the service. Self valet is $7 for 2 hours, and $3 for each additional hour.\nWhat is the final guaranteed guest count for private events?\nA guaranteed guest count is required no later than 3 business days prior to the date of the event.

There are no exceptions concerning this guarantee & the guarantee must be emailed to the Event Coordinator.\nWhat is the cancellation policy for private events?\nIn the unlikely event you should cancel, all deposits are nonrefundable. In the event of a cancellation within seven days of the scheduled event, the client will be responsible for payment of 50% of the estimated food & beverage plus 7% sales tax & 20% gratuity.
