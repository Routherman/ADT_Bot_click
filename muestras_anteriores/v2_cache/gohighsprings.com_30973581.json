It closed thereafter and remained closed for several years. After changing ownership it reopened as \"The Great Outdoors Restaurant\" with the goal of providing excellent food & drink, and being a gathering place for all. Since 2008 we have remained true to that goal. Providing tasty options for everyone, friendly service, and indoor and outdoor dining options, we invite you to become part of the story.\nLed by Leadership\nGeneral Manager Anthony Paparella\nEat. Drink. Relax.\nWe proudly feature live music every Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday Evenings. From local favorites to talented up-and-coming artists.
