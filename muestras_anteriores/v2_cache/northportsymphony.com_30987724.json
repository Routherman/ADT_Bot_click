Other Orchestra conductors included Arthur Thiel and Sasha von Dassow.\n\n​At the October 2000 Board of Trustees Meeting, the Board President, Ruth McArdle announced that the North Port Orchestra had received a $57,205.00 grant from the Venice Foundation. Even though the Performing Arts Center and Music studio were still under construction, the funds were earmarked for instrument storage, chairs, risers, and other equipment to fully equip the new music studio.\n\n​In 2011, the Orchestra was renamed the North Port Symphony. The acclaimed Robert Romanski joined the Symphony in 2012, as Principal Conductor and Artistic Director, where the symphony has flourished under his direction.  The Symphony continues to perform five concerts annually, November to March, as it has since 1984.\n\n​The Symphony is composed of talented amateur, professional and student musicians who volunteer their time and talents to share in the joy of music with the community.\n\nOur Vision Statement is to be “the most welcoming community orchestra in southwest Florida, and to cultivate a sense of belonging between our patrons, musicians, students and community.”\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nOur Musicians\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\nBoard & Staff\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\nThe Maestro\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nCelebrating Our History\n/$\n$\nOn January 21, 1984, the North Port Orchestra, as it was called then, held its inaugural performance at St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church on Sumter Avenue in North Port.  ​The group was formed by 15 local residents, who were interested in playing music not only for themselves but for the community.  After almost one year of recruiting retired professional and amateur musicians from the area, the first concert was held.\n\nIn the late ‘80’s, several string players from the Orchestra, in conjunction with the newly opened Glenallen Elementary School, developed after-school string programs.  The instruction was from members of the North Port Orchestra.  At this time there were no instrumental programs offered by the school.\n\n​As interest grew, a Youth Orchestra was formed in the mid ‘90’s and it performed in tandem on numerous occasions with the North Port Orchestra.  The Youth Orchestra was 45-members strong, including violin, cello, flute, trumpet, and clarinet.\n\n​​Through the years, the North Port Orchestra has celebrated many anniversaries.  The 10th anniversary in 1993-94, included, in music performed at the very first concert, conducted by Jim Richardson; 20 years was celebrated, under the direction of Theodore Dollarhide, and 30 years in 2013-14.
