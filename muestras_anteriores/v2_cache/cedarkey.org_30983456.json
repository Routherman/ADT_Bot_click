      "text": "About\nCedar Key Chamber of Commerce\nFounded 1983\nCedar Key Chamber of Commerce is the informational hub of the City and area.\nWelcome to Cedar Key, a place where time stands still and allows you to enjoy the unique qualities of our coastal environment.\nCedar Key is a quiet island community nestled among many tiny keys on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Long admired for its natural beauty and abundant seafood supply, it is a tranquil village rich with the almost forgotten history of old Florida.\nOur island is located 50 miles southwest of Gainesville, Florida. It sits three miles out into the Gulf of Mexico. Highway 24 is only one road coming into town. It crosses over the salt marshes and channels on four small, low bridges. The population is approximately 800 full-time residents.\nThere are no high rises or huge apartment complexes. We are a community of quaint cottages, single-family homes, working waterfront, and aquaculture structures. The view as you cross the Number Four Bridge is spell-binding.\nCedar Key is a haven for artists, writers, and “adventure” tourists, who find the unspoiled environment their inspiration. Thousands of visitors come annually to enjoy the “Old Florida Celebration of the Arts” in April, the 4th of July, the October Seafood Festival, the Pirate Festival, and The Stargazing Party in February.  Our island provides a place for excellent fishing, bird watching, nature trails, kayaking, and coastal guided tours. Federally protected sanctuaries, the Cedar Keys form a chain of barrier islands ideally suited to a vast range of migratory and shore birds, including the elusive white pelican, roseate spoonbill, and bald eagle. The variety of natural habitats, from salt marshes to Indian shell mounds, makes this truly a nature lover’s paradise.\nThe small-town feeling is absolute – transportation is by car, but the road is shared with bicycles and golf carts. Drivers and pedestrians wave to locals and visitors alike greeting each other with a warm welcome to our island. The nearest major airports are Tampa and Orlando, there’s a regional airport in nearby Gainesville, and we have an airstrip on the island where many small plane enthusiasts land.\nCedar Key Chamber of Commerce\nFounded 1983\nCedar Key Chamber of Commerce is the informational hub of the City and area.\nWelcome to Cedar Key, a place where time stands still and allows you to enjoy the unique qualities of our coastal environment.\nCedar Key is a quiet island community nestled among many tiny keys on the Gulf Coast of Florida.
