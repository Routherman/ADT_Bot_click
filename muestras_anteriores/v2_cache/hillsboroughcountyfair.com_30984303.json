Fairs play an important role in showcasing the agricultural, educational, and industrial history and social fabric of a community. In 1990 a group of citizens decided to bring back the traditions of a county fair and formed The Greater Hillsborough County Fair Association, Inc. Initial Fairs were held on the grounds of the Florida State Fair and the next seven fairs were held on the grounds of Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\nThe fair transitioned from a tenant at Raymond James Stadium to an operational Fairgrounds at our current location in Dover, FL in 2007. In 2007 and 2008 the fair was held as Livestock shows and the Fair with a ride midway, entertainment, competitive exhibits and livestock shows returned in 2009. The five-day fair was successful and has grown every year.\nIn 2011 spectator events were held in the new 1800 seat arena for the first time and patrons attended two nights of Ranch Rodeo in addition to other Fair events. 2013 saw the completion of a 20,000 square foot multi-use building with new restrooms. A portion of the Livestock Program could now be housed under the building and the Family Living entries previously displayed under a tent were moved into the building.\n2014 saw another expansion when the five-day event was expanded to eight days encompassing two weekends. Livestock Shows were spread between the weekends and alleviated the overcrowding. The Fair operated Thursday through Sunday each weekend. The first weekend featured two nights of Ranch Rodeo and a Mexican Rodeo in the arena. The second weekend of arena events hosted a Bulls and Barrels Rodeo, Truck and Tractor Pull and finished the last day with a Demolition Derby. A host of other events were also held – Talent Shows, Battle of the Bands, Harvest Queen Scholarship Contest, Livestock Shows, Baby Pageants, Arts, Photography and a Hay Bale Decorating Contest honoring our “Hometown Heroes”.\nThe Present:\nIn 2021, the Fair expanded once again to an eleven-day fair allowing for an expanded schedule for our growing youth livestock program. We currently offer 11 species in our livestock program and have over 600 youth exhibitors. The fair offers family fun with carnival rides and games, fair food, local educational exhibits, free family entertainment and our historical Hometown Hillsborough area. We host special events in our main arena with Rodeos, Truck and Tractor Pulls and a Demolition Derby! In 2022, the Fair expanded the midway partnering with carnival operator, Dreamland Amusements, to provide new and exciting thrill rides and more rides in the kiddie sections. The 2023 Fair saw record breaking attendance and included record number of youth exhibitors competing in a variety of youth livestock shows, youth exhibits and projects.\nThe Future:\nThe Greater Hillsborough County Fair focuses on family fair tradition in Hillsborough County. We know that importance of providing wholesome family fun is rooted in many years of tradition that are a large part of our county fair. With a variety of free entertainment, events and community competitions and family fun Midway, our county fair offers something for everyone! The 2025 fair will be Oct 30-Nov 9, 2025!!
