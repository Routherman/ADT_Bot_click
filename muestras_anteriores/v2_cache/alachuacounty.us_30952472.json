Receive a complaint ‐ all citizens wishing to file a complaint, are required to provide their name and address, per FSS 162.\n2. Inspect the property ‐ a code officer will inspect the property, and if there is a violation, a Notice of Violation (NOV) will be sent to the owner of the property. This NOV states that a complaint has been filed and describes the nature of the complaint, as well as a timeline to come into compliance. This is an opportunity for the property owner to contact Code Administration, to discuss the violation (s) and how to correct them.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n3. Possible Special Magistrate Hearing ‐ If the property owner does not comply within the time specified in the NOV, the case will be heard by the Code Administration Special Magistrate. If the Special Magistrate adjudicates the property owner guilty of the violation, and the property owner does not come into compliance within the specified timeframe, the Special Magistrate may access fines up to $1,000 per day for the first offense(s), and up to $5,000 per day for a repeat violation. Failure to comply with the Special Magistrate’s legal order, may result in further fines, liens or foreclosures.\nContact Us\nMonday-Friday\n8:30am-4:30pm\n(352) 374-5238\n12 SE 1st Street\nGainesville, FL 32601\nCodes@alachuacounty.us\nDirector:\n​\nScott Krajewski​\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nClick Here to View Current Emergency Orders\nAlachua County aims to continually improve the\r\n                          accessibility and usability of its website.
