We are family owned an operated by three generations of locals who take pride in the love they have for \"Duvaaalll\" and all its people.\nLocation\nWe are conveniently located right where the hustle of downtown Jacksonville meets the historic San Marco neighborhood. Our long-time bar is hard to miss, that is thanks to our stunningly intricate mural done by a well-known local artist Jason Tetlak. You'll find us just beyond the overpass by the train tracks, just look for the mural!\nServices, Games, & More!\nNot only do we offer multiple pool tables and dart boards, but pin ball, virtual golf and bowling as well! In our back bar, The Stable, we have beer pong, life-sized jenga and checkers for all to enjoy. Our touch tunes music system allows for our patrons to pick what they want to hear while they enjoy their cocktail of choice.\nInstagram\nCopyright © 2025 Sherwood's  - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by",
