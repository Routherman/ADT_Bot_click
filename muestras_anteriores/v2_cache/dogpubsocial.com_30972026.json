      "text": "About Dog Pub Social\nDog Pub Social\nis Dunedin’s first-ever off-leash dog park and bar concept. A Pooch Pass is required for each dog to enter and can be purchased on-site as a single-day or multi-day pass. Humans always enter free and can enjoy full-liquor drinks, handcrafted cocktails, local brews, wine, cannabis-infused beverages, mocktails, and tasty food for both pups and their people.\nThe Dog Pub Social features multiple off-leash play areas designed for fun and safety. Each area includes 6-foot fencing, double-gated entries and exits, playground equipment, toys, puppy pools, and artificial turf to help keep pups clean. All play zones are monitored by DPS staff to ensure a safe and tidy environment.\nAt Dog Pub Social, we strive to be more than just a dog bar—we’re proud to be a part of the\nDOGEDIN\ncommunity. We host breed-specific meetups, rescue events, fundraisers, social hours, wine tastings, fitness and yoga classes, live music, and televised sporting events.\nMeet the Founder\nJ.P.
