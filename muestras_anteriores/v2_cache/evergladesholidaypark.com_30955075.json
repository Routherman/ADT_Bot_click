Let’s explore some of the specific benefits of holding your next corporate meeting in a natural setting that contribute to this increase in productivity.\nEnhanced Employee Engagement\nHolding an event in a natural setting helps to boost employee engagement. When employees are able to connect over a fun, shared activity with a common goal that involves team building, they will, in turn, be more engaged with each other. This type of engagement carries far beyond the actual experience and leaves employees with lasting memories that continue to drive connection and, thus, productivity when back in the corporate space.\nBuilding stronger teams\nWhen employees are able to relish in a shared experience together, whether that be an airboat tour over the stunning Everglades or team-building activities on our expansive land, it builds stronger teams in the workplace. The skills learned over team building activities in the field are shown to carry over to the workplace, thus creating stronger teams and, therefore, higher levels of productivity.\nDeveloping Skills\nHolding a team building event in a natural setting helps increase workplace productivity further by helping employees develop skills. When employees are given the same tasks in the same environment, it can be challenging to reach out of their comfort zone and develop new skills. Whether or not the skills learned in the Everglades are related to work or not, learning new things helps employees feel empowered and valued by their workplace. Even if the skill is just developing further social skills, it becomes much easier to do so in a peaceful, natural setting rather than a high-stakes corporate setting.\nPromoting Wellness\nA healthy workforce is a productive workforce, and research has shown again and again that spending time in nature promotes wellness. Just the act of being in the fresh air and enjoying the sounds of nature has proven health benefits. Being in nature promotes physical and mental well-being, and healthy, happy employees are much more likely to be engaged, focused, and productive.\nFacilitating Knowledge Sharing\nAdditionally, hosting a corporate event in nature facilitates knowledge sharing. Being in an open environment different than that of the day-to-day, or a closed-off indoor environment, allows people that do not normally interact to do so. People from different departments are able to have shared experiences and thus share knowledge, thus increasing productivity in the workplace.\nOverall, through investing in events that bring joy to their employees, such as hosting events in nature, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to employee growth and connection, ultimately leading to a more productive workplace. It shows employees that the corporation cares about their wellbeing and leads to employees to become more invested in the workplace, and gives them a shared activity to connect over. Therefore, it becomes essential for companies to prioritize these types of events as key components of their culture.\nPreferred Venues for Large Groups\nThe pavilion is one of the most preferred venues for larger groups. This is due to the number of people that it is able to host in all kinds of weather conditions, as well as the joy of sharing a meal in the open air. We regularly host large picnics, catered events, team-building activities, or use it as a meeting space. Sound carries exceptionally well in the pavilion, making it a great space to meet before and after the Everglades airboat tour, touch base, or even touch base on work related things before heading into the office the following day.\nLooking for the perfect venue for that corporate slide presentation or family reunion near Fort Lauderdale in Broward County?
