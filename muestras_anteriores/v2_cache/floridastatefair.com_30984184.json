That has been the core of our efforts since our first fair, held in downtown Tampa at Henry B. Plant’s Tampa Bay Hotel.\n1915 - 1975\nTaking Root\nIn 1915, we combined with Tampa’s Gasparilla Carnival to become the biggest, best, most-deep-fried event of the year – now known as the Florida State Fair. Community members gathered from every corner of the state to eat, compete and celebrate everything Florida.\n1975 - 2019\nMoving Home\nAs we grew in popularity, the need for a governing body arose. In 1975, the Florida State Legislature created the Florida State Fair Authority. Now an official organization, we packed up and moved to our new home – the Florida State Fairgrounds you know and love today, just off of Interstate 4\n2022 and Beyond\nFind Your Fun\nToday, the Florida State Fairgrounds is a year-round hub for community-oriented fun. The Fairgrounds attracts over 1.5 million visitors throughout the year, all looking to have fun, learn, or try something new. While some things have changed, our goals have not. We still strive to celebrate Florida through amazing events, hands-on experiences and educational opportunities.\nTODAY’S STATE FAIR\n500K\nAttendees annually\nOn average over the last decade.\n90+\nMidway rides\nLargest midway in North America.\n$1M\nPREMIUMS\nAwarded to exhibitors and competitors.\nQUICKLINKS\nMAP\nCONTACT\nBOARD",
