      "text": "events at the bay\nThank you for considering The Bay for your special occasion. We look forward to exceeding your expectations and creating a memorable experience for you and your guests. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss your event in more detail, please do not hesitate to contact us.\nEvent Hours\nOur operating hours are from 11:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. To comply with our neighborhood noise ordinance, we kindly request that all events conclude by 9:30 p.m. and that guests vacate the premises by 10:00 p.m.\nThe Walton Room\nOur private dining room can accommodate up to 25 guests and offers pre-set menus to suit your needs. Thereâs no charge for using the private dining room, but we do have food and drink minimums that change with the seasons and menu choices. If your total bill is less than the minimum, weâll charge the difference as the room fee.\nThe Garden Patio\nFor larger gatherings of up to 85 guests, we offer outdoor space. The space fee and menu options vary depending on the season. Tent rentals are available upon request to provide coverage in case of inclement weather.\nThe Restaurant\nThe entire restaurant can be reserved, subject to availability, for your event, with details such as pricing available upon request.\nBayside Pergolas\nOur three charming pergolas can accommodate up to 36 guests. Nestled on our sandy beach overlooking Choctawhatchee Bay, our Bayside Pergolas offer a picturesque setting for small wedding receptions, cozy family celebrations, or corporate retreats. Each pergola seats up to 12 guests providing a memorable experience in a serene natural setting.\nProvisions\nWe provide standard table settings for all events, including white linens and cloth napkins. Our preferred vendors can arrange customizations and additional event options.\nStaffing\nStaffing policy: The number of servers or bartenders will be determined based on the size and complexity of the event to ensure excellent service. Additional fees may apply for setup and breakdown. A 23% gratuity for all events will also be added to your final invoice.\nBeverage Options\nChoose from our extensive wine list and full-service bar.
