      "text": "31st Annual The Lights Of Lake Park Estates\nTo Benefit the Suncoast Hospice / Empath Health. Welcome to the website of\nThe Lights of Lake Park Estates\n. The intent of this site is only to provide the public with information, maps, and some photos about this event, where the neighborhoods of\nLake Park Estates\n,\nWieker\n,\nLakeside Estates\n, and\nLake Seminole Village\n, generously decorate their homes and yards with over 3.0 miles of Christmas Lights and Decorations for the public to enjoy. Donations are accepted at the\nSuncoast Hospice Cart\nlocated along the route. 100% of the donations are provided to Suncoast Hospice to support their community activities. This is the 31st year of the Lights of Lake Park. The event has raised over $1 million dollars since its inception in 1993.\nHistory\nThe Lights of Lake Park Estates originated in 1993 to celebrate the life of our neighbor, Ruby Dow, and salute the care she received from our community hospice, Suncoast Hospice. Because of\nSuncoast Hospice\n, Ruby lived her final days in dignity – in her own home – surrounded by those who cared about her. Those of us who had the pleasure of knowing Ruby will always remember her beautiful smile and the last Christmas she shared with us. In 2007 Eddie Dow, Ruby’s husband, whose passion and spirit made all this possible, passed away. With our memories of Ruby and Eddie shining as brightly as our holiday lights, we rededicate The Light of Lake Park Estates to both of them and\nSuncoast Hospice / Empath Health\n.\nSuncoast Hospice, a proud member of Empath Health\nSuncoast Hospice\nprovides programs and services for people of all ages and walks of life. Founded in 1977 and licensed in 1981,\nSuncoast Hospice\ntruly belongs to the people of Pinellas County Florida. Focused on comfort, compassion, and community, Suncoast Hospice serves people living with advanced illnesses or chronic conditions, those who are caregivers, or individuals grieving the death of loved ones.
