However, we’re grateful to report that all of our precious artifacts were safely preserved, thanks to t\nFor Upcoming Events click here\nChildren's History Song\nStudents from Cedar Key School visited the museum before summer break and were treated to this song! Children learn through music!\nScenes from a Successful Gala Fundraiser with Kerry Gordon\nA Successful Gala Fundraiser\nThe Cedar Key Historical Society Museum held its first fundraiser on Saturday, November 8, 2024, in the newly renovated Lutterloh Building, following the devastation caused by Category 4 Hurricane Helene.\nThe event featured the talented singer-songwriter Kerry Gordon, who took the stage, captivating the audience with his soulful voice and personal stories about the rich culture and history of the Cedar Key music scene.  As he performed a unique selection of songs, Gordon’s music and stories resonated within the hearts of the listeners.\nTickets for the event were $25 each, and they sold out within just 10 days, showcasing the community's eagerness to support the museum. Although many members of the historical society could not attend, they generously purchased tickets to ensure that those affected by the hurricane could attend. This generosity highlighted the solidarity that Cedar Key is known for.\nGuests enjoyed a delicious assortment of appetizers and drinks catered by the Historical Society, along with BBQ Bills' smoked chicken and sides. The evening featured a silent auction with high-quality items, significantly contributing to the fundraiser's success. Together, we raised over $5,000, directly supporting the repairs needed for the museum’s Andrews House, which suffered significant damage during the hurricane.\nA special moment of the night was the honorary membership awarded to local business owner Scott Larsen for his remarkable contributions to helping the community post-Hurricane Helene. Larsen organized numerous volunteers and essential equipment to help remove destroyed buildings and debris free of charge, and he launched volunteers and building materials to assist many locals in rebuilding their homes and businesses at no expense to the owner.\nAttendees dressed to impress, filling the venue with positivity and hope as the community continues to rebuild.\nThe Cedar Key Historical Society Museum remains committed to preserving and sharing the island's rich history as it moves forward from Hurricane Helene's devastation.\nNote: This news story covering the November 8th event was intentionally postponed several weeks out of respect for the unexpected, sudden loss of Kerry Gordon's brother, Rick Gordon.\nA Stunning Photo Gallery of the Gala Fundraiser Event\nThis site copyright @2022 The Cedar Key Historical Society Inc.

These pioneering individuals had a mission to actively promote and safeguard the unique past of the Cedar Key Islands and nearby areas from being lost forever. In 1979, they opened the Cedar Key Historical Society Museum. Over forty years on, and that spirit is still alive! Countless volunteers and members have kept this invaluable legacy alive for new generations to experience, passing along their enthusiasm for a unique history that was a vital part of the history of Florida and the Gulf Coast. The Cedar Key Historical Society reminds us why protecting our heritage is essential.\nPresent: Board of Directors\nMeet the Board\nPRESIDENT - (Interim) BOB WOOLEY\nVICE PRESIDENT - CAROLYN COHEN\nTREASURER - BOB WOOLEY\nSECRETARY - MICHAEL HOSTETLER\nBOARD MEMBER - MIKE PETERSON\nBOARD MEMBER - BRENDA WINEBRENNER\nBOARD MEMBER - MIKE ROBERTS\nBOARD MEMBER - FAYE SANDERS\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- ANNA WHITE HODGES\nYou can reach the Board of Directors by sending an email through the \"Contact Us\" button below or send letter through US MAIL Address:\nThe Cedar Key Historical Society\nP.O.

We celebrate these passionate volunteers for propelling us forward to enable preservation and sharing of this community’s iconic history!\nLearn More About Membership\nIt took a group of visionaries, referred to as founding members, to assemble and devise a plan to bring an idea from its initial conception to reality, gifting the future by preserving the past. The Cedar Key Historical Society Museum is a legacy they left us.\nCLICK HERE FOR BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM\nPAST:  First Docent- Ruth Wagner ( 1889 - 1994)\nSun Sentinal Article Featuring Ruth  Wagner -1986\nOur Vanishing Shores\nClick to Read Article\nA Brief History of the Cedar Key Historical Society Museum\nThe Beginning - 1977\nThe Beginning - 1977\nThe Beginning - 1977\nThe idea of Cedar Key Historical Society began with artist Polly Pillsbury. She and her husband Sam moved to Cedar Key from Jacksonville in the early 1970s. Polly opened an art studio and enjoyed painting Cedar Key scenes and historic buildings. She learned of Cedar Key’s unique and rich history dating back to the early 1800s before Florida became a State. As a result, Polly spearheaded an effort to establish the Cedar Key Historical Society with the ultimate goal of establishing a Cedar Key Historical Museum to preserve and display Cedar Key’s history. She obtained the Cedar Key Historical Society charter from the State of Florida in 1977.\nMuseum building\nThe Beginning - 1977\nThe Beginning - 1977\nPolly and other interested local citizens then began raising money through fundraisers and private donations. These efforts were successful in raising $5,000.00, which was used to purchase the historic Lutterloh Building from Mrs. Gertrude Teas. The purchase agreement also included payments of $100.00 per month to Mrs. Teas as long as she lived. Polly had help from other charter members, which included Mrs. Gertrude Teas, Billie Hindal, Etta Watson, Mary Ann Delaino, Helen Evans, Bill & Janet Betts, Webster & Marie Johnson, Mary Hale Mizell, Henry Rucker, Ruth Wagner, Fran Taylor and others.\nacquiring artifacts  Exhibits\nacquiring artifacts  Exhibits\nacquiring artifacts  Exhibits\nTwo archeologists, Gordon and Barbara DeAngelo from Maine were spending the winters in Cedar Key and with the help of Ruth Wagner and others collected numerous artifacts, photos etc. Display cases were obtained from stores on 2nd Street,  The DeAngelos were in charge of creating most of the wonderful exhibits currently housed in the Lutterloh Building.  Dr. Charles Fishburne a professional historian also moved to Cedar Key around 1980 and was responsible for collecting many of the historical documents now in our historical archives. He also published a great book entitled The Cedar Key in the 19th Century available exclusively in the Gift Shop.\nMuseum Opening - 1979\nacquiring artifacts  Exhibits\nacquiring artifacts  Exhibits\nEverything was completed and the Museum was opened to public in 1979. It was an immediate success and of course continues to be to this day. The City of Cedar Key owes much to this farsighted group of citizens who put untold hours and vision to create what probably is the best small museum in the State of Florida. ADDITIONAL SPACE was needed for exhibits so Lindon Lindsey’s son Don and his cousin built an addition to the west side of the Lutterloh Building in memory of his deceased wife Marguerite. At this time this room houses exhibits depicting the pictorial history of Cedar Key, the seafood industry and the photo-hanging file. Another building house more exhibits would come nearly 20 yrs later, with the Andrews House/Office of the Standard Manufacturing Company.\nFrom the Past to the Present\nLinda Parker Hudson\nThe Cedar Key Historical Society Museum is immensely grateful to Linda Parker Hudson for her years of dedication and ongoing support, even in the face of disasters like hurricanes or pandemics. Thanks to Ms.Hudson's passion, drive, and commitment to preserving the unique history of this beloved island community, we are still standing strong despite enormous challenges; we remain resilient! Her contributions will continue reverberating through generations as a testament to what it means to go above and beyond when our society needs us most.\nTop of Page\nBoard Policies and Legal Notices\nAN INTERESTING SUN-SENTINAL ARTICLE FEATURING RUTH WAGNER\nRecognizing Ruth Wagner (1899-1994)the Museum's first docent\nDownload PDF\nhome\nThis site copyright @2022 The Cedar Key Historical Society Inc.
