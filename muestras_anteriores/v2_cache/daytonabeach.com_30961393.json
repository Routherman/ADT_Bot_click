In order to develop this business, the DBACVB has put in place an Event Funding Program. All requests for funds must receive the recommendation from the CVB Sports Advisory Committee and Halifax Area Advertising Authority Board of Directors. Once a sponsorship amount has been allocated, we will not disburse funds until after the event has been completed and a post-event economic impact report has been produced.\nApplication Deadline:\nFunding applications will be reviewed on a quarterly basis unless alternate accommodations have been made. The amount of funding requested will be a factor in determining the length of this process.\nSports Event Funding Guidelines\nDownloadable Sports Funding Application\n* EVENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONTRACTED ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING*\nReimbursement/Accountability\nWithin 30 days after the completion of the event, the organization must submit a Post Event Report, copy of collateral displaying the DBACVB logo, Invoice for grant funds (addressed to Halifax Area Advertising Authority), and a W-9 tax form. After a review of the Post Event Report, grant funds will be forwarded to the organization.\nIf the original award amount must be prorated due to major changes in the event, an updated invoice will be requested with the new award amount.\nThe DBACVB will conduct random audits to promote the accuracy of attendance and room nights reported in the Post Event Report.\nNatural disasters and other incidents that may affect the impact generated by the event will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nAll questions can be directed to: Brandon Little, Senior Sales Manager, Sports Business Development,\nblittle@daytonabeach.com\n, 386-255-0415 ext. 138\n*Please be advised that completing an application does not guarantee funding.\nDownloadable Sports Funding Application\nSubmitting this form means you certify that you have read and understood the Policies and Procedures and that the information included with the application is true and correct.",
