My boyfriend loves the cigar selection and you can enjoy a drink and/or smoke while you’re there. There’s a huge selection of wine and cigars so you can find something for everyone. My first time in the shop, I was looking for a wine pairing for bacon-wrapped filets, and the owner Gary knew exactly which wine would suit the dish right away! And it was incredible, he is knowledgeable on each and every wine.\n\nSince then I have been a regular customer there. The customer service is great and I really love the atmosphere. Any pairing or recommendation I need I know I can trust Gary and any staff member. The wine selection is hand-picked by the owner and not too expensive. This is a small business and truly a hidden gem!\n\nWhen I want to try a new wine or my boyfriend wants a good cigar we shop here.
