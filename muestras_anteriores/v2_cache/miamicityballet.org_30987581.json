Not sure where your membership is valid?\nClick here to check your zone.\nStep 3\n–\nAdd to cart and checkout\nOnce you’ve chosen your seats, add them to your cart. Then choose your preferred delivery method and pay to complete your order.\nThat’s it! Your member benefits — including your discounted price, free exchanges, and no service fees — will apply automatically.\nMembership FAQs\nHow is a membership different from a subscription?\nPremium subscriptions\noffer the added benefit of securing the same seats each year when you renew, while getting first access to change your seats before tickets are released to the public.\nA membership\nallows you to book from the best available seats in your membership zone when it is convenient for you.\nHow do I verify my age eligibility for my membership?\nSome memberships such as the\n$25 Under 25\nand\nBarre Society\nrequire age verification.\nClick here\nto verify your eligibility in two easy steps.\nFill out the\nform\nincluding your email, first and last name, and your company or school. Click Continue.\nUpload an image or pdf a valid ID.\nOnce your file has been successfully uploaded, you may close the window.\nYou will receive an email confirmation from\naudienceservices@miamicityballet.org\nonce your eligibility has been approved and your membership is active.\nCan I use my membership for any performance?\nMemberships are valid for all main season performances at the\nArsht Center\n. Select memberships include access to our seasonal presentation of\nThe Nutcracker\n, please check your membership benefits to see if your membership is eligible for Nutcracker booking.\nMemberships cannot be used for MCB School year-end performances.\nWhen and how do I redeem tickets?\nMembership tickets must be redeemed at least\n72 hours before the performance\nyou plan to attend.\nTickets can only be redeemed online through your MCB account.\nClick here\nto log into your MCB account and select the performance you want to book for. Select seats within your membership zone and then “checkout” to complete your order.\nIf your zone is sold out, you’ll get access to the next best available section.\nTickets cannot be redeemed at the venue.\nAre seats held for members?\nDue to high demand for our productions we do not hold seats for member or subscriber redemption once our single tickets go on sale. However, members do receive\nearly access\nfor newly added performances.\nWe recommend booking early for the best options.\nWhere can I sit with my membership?\nEach membership gives you access to a specific seating zone — plus any zones further from the stage (i.e., lower price points). When booking, be sure to select seats within your eligible zones:\nCorporate Memberships (Premium & Plus)\nAccess Front Orchestra and any zones behind it.\nOn Pointe Membership\nAccess Rear Orchestra Circle, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4.\nBarre Society Membership (ages 26–40)\nAccess Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4.\nStudent Membership (ages 18–25)\nAccess Tier 3 and Tier 4 only.\nYou’ll only see your member pricing when selecting seats in these eligible zones.\nWhat if my membership zone is sold out?\nYou’ll\nstill have access to the next best available zone or section with open seats.\nCan I use my membership at other venues?\nCurrently, during this inaugural year, memberships are only valid for performances at the\nArsht Center\n.\nHowever, we understand that things come up. If you have already booked your ticket for a performance at the Arsht Center you can call or email an audience service representative and request to have your existing tickets exchanged and moved to the same production at either the\nBroward Center\nor\nKravis Center\n. All exchange policies still apply.\nCan I purchase more than one membership?\nNo\n, due to the limited number of memberships available, each person may\npurchase\none membership per season. If you\npurchased\na membership and wish to upgrade your membership to a different level, please contact a member of the\nAudience Services\nteam\nfor assistance\n.\nWhen does my membership expire? Can I renew my membership?\nAll membership benefits expire on May 1, 2026.\nAny unused benefits or tickets are not transferable to the following season productions.\nMemberships are a pilot program this season. We’ll contact you in summer 2026 about renewing or upgrading to a subscription.\nHave feedback about the membership program?\nWe’d\nlove to hear from you!
