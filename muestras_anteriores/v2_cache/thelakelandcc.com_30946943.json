      "text": "ABOUT US\nThe Lakeland Country Club was established in 1924 on the scenic shore of Lake Hollingsworth and is the oldest private club in the area. The Club has maintained a rich heritage of providing generations of members a place to socialize with friends and family, participate in numerous types of recreation and team sports, and enjoy signature social and holiday activities. Our members and community have benefited from the perfect lake setting to host business, professional, civic and cultural events.\nThe new Club seamlessly blends the old with the new. While the new structure has the same character and feel of the old Club with its Spanish Mediterranean architecture, new amenities such as Resort Style Pool, Fitness Center and lakefront Veranda Bar, make the Club like none other in our community. Whether dining casually in the Grill Room or fine dining in the Club Room, you will experience fresh, seasonal selections as well as the traditional Club favorites, with impeccable service.\nThe Lakeland Country Club\n929 Lake Hollingsworth Drive\nLakeland, FL 33803\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nPhone:\n(863) 680-2582\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nEmail:\n[email protected]\nTHis is one item with icon and text\n© 2025  The Lakeland Country Club.
