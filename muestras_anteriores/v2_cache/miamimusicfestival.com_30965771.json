While the next generation of classical artists come to Miami to receive instruction from an assembly of world-class faculty, the community benefits from accessible public concerts featuring top talent alongside many of classical music’s greatest living performers in repertoire rarely heard in South Florida.\nWith training institutes in Orchestra, Opera, Piano, and Conducting, MMF development also includes an Alumni Division, Pre-College Program, a pioneering Career Institute, and the Professional Miami Wagner Institute to support artists in all stages of their careers. MMF receives nearly 1,500 international applicants each season, selecting around 200 participants through a rigorous audition process. MMF has welcomed students and faculty from over 25 countries and many of the world’s most esteemed music institutions. The festival attracts internationally sought-after performers and teaching-artists eager to identify and cultivate the pre-professional careers of talented young musicians.\nIn eleven seasons, the festival has expanded to present over 70 public events each year, including 5 full opera productions, 4 symphonic concerts, 7 student and faculty recitals; 20 opera, chamber music, Zarzuela, and Musical theater concerts; and 30 masterclasses hosted throughout Miami venues. Furthermore, MMF is dedicated to engaging local youth and Miami’s underserved neighborhoods through successful outreach, community partnerships and by providing accessible events and tickets.\nAfter unprecedented growth in its eleven years, MMF continues to build on its success by expanding programming, increasing community outreach, and creating unique classical opportunities that bring pride to our vibrant and cultured city.\nA MESSAGE FROM MICHAEL ROSSI, FOUNDER AND ARTISTIC DIRECTOR\nDear Esteemed Patrons,\nWe are honored to have you join us for the eleventh season of the Miami Beach Classical Music Festival (MMF).

MMF deepens its partnership with The Betsy-South Beach, its longtime host hotel, and will continue as a special concert venue for evening student performances, as it has done since the program’s inception. Temple Emanu-El will also be hosting a Symphony Concert for our MMF Conducting Institute where emerging artists gain valuable experience leading a full orchestra while being coached, as they study all aspects of the art of conducting with acclaimed faculty.\nI can’t express how grateful we are to the City of Miami Beach, The Betsy-South Beach, and Faena Art for giving us so much support to make this festival possible.

The Children’s Trust is a dedicated source of revenue established by voter referendum to improve the lives of children and families in Miami-Dade County.\nThe mission of the Miami Beach Classical Music Festival is to provide affordable, world-class musical instruction and ground-breaking performance experiences to young artists and the South Florida region.\nSince its 2013 inception, Miami Beach Classical Music Festival (MMF) has been proud to establish Miami as a premier destination for elite young classical musicians to train and perform. While the next generation of classical artists come to Miami to receive instruction from an assembly of world-class faculty, the community benefits from accessible public concerts featuring top talent alongside many of classical music’s greatest living performers in repertoire rarely heard in South Florida.\nWith training institutes in Orchestra, Opera, Piano, and Conducting, MMF development also includes an Alumni Division, Pre-College Program, a pioneering Career Institute, and the Professional Miami Wagner Institute to support artists in all stages of their careers. MMF receives nearly 1,500 international applicants each season, selecting around 200 participants through a rigorous audition process. MMF has welcomed students and faculty from over 25 countries and many of the world’s most esteemed music institutions. The festival attracts internationally sought-after performers and teaching-artists eager to identify and cultivate the pre-professional careers of talented young musicians.\nIn eleven seasons, the festival has expanded to present over 70 public events each year, including 5 full opera productions, 4 symphonic concerts, 7 student and faculty recitals; 20 opera, chamber music, Zarzuela, and Musical theater concerts; and 30 masterclasses hosted throughout Miami venues. Furthermore, MMF is dedicated to engaging local youth and Miami’s underserved neighborhoods through successful outreach, community partnerships and by providing accessible events and tickets.\nAfter unprecedented growth in its eleven years, MMF continues to build on its success by expanding programming, increasing community outreach, and creating unique classical opportunities that bring pride to our vibrant and cultured city.\nA MESSAGE FROM MICHAEL ROSSI, FOUNDER AND ARTISTIC DIRECTOR\nDear Esteemed Patrons,\nWe are honored to have you join us for the eleventh season of the Miami Beach Classical Music Festival (MMF). Our 2024 season brought more than 200 young artists to Miami Beach for six weeks of study and performance experiences.\nMMF is grateful to return to our home on Miami Beach since 2019. MMF deepens its partnership with The Betsy-South Beach, its longtime host hotel, and will continue as a special concert venue for evening student performances, as it has done since the program’s inception. Temple Emanu-El will also be hosting a Symphony Concert for our MMF Conducting Institute where emerging artists gain valuable experience leading a full orchestra while being coached, as they study all aspects of the art of conducting with acclaimed faculty.\nI can’t express how grateful we are to the City of Miami Beach, The Betsy-South Beach, and Faena Art for giving us so much support to make this festival possible.
