Combined with extensive education programs for people of all ages through guided tours and self-guided audio tours, we strive to inspire actionable change in our supporters to take lessons from their visit to their daily lives.

We are also the youngest garden in history to receive the American Public Gardens Association’s prestigious Award for Garden Excellence in 2017.\nFrom our commitment to our local communities, to our award-winning horticultural design and our comprehensive approach to sustainability, Naples Botanical Garden is truly a special place. None of this would be possible without generous support. We believe we have the most committed and impressive group of members, donors and volunteers. They have been instrumental to our success so far, and we know they will help us achieve our bold vision for the future.\nA Brief History of the Garden\nThe Garden was founded in 1993 by a visionary group of local plant enthusiasts. The organization incorporated with the IRS with 501 C (3) status in 1994. In 2000, the late Harvey Kapnick, Jr. donated $5 million for the purchase of 170 acres of open space 3 miles from downtown Naples. In 2006, the team of Ellin Goetz, Ted Flato, Raymond Jungles, Herb Schaal, Bob Truskowski and Made Wijaya, dubbed the “Dream Team” by the Miami Herald, completed the master plan for Naples Botanical Garden.\nConstruction on the first phase began in 2008 with the digging of Deep Lake and Lake Tupke and the sculpting of the site with 250,000 yards of fill produced by lake excavation. In November of 2009, the Garden opened the Kapnick Brazilian Garden, Kapnick Caribbean Garden and the Smith River of Grass. In January 2010, The Florida Gulf Coast University Harvey Kapnick Research and Education Center, a shared use facility, opened. Later in 2010, the Garden opened the Scott Florida Garden, Buehler Enabling Garden, Garden Club of Naples Idea Garden, Lea Asian Garden and the Water Garden.\nIn October of 2014, the master plan implementation was completed with the opening the Chabraja Visitor Center including Kathryn’s Garden, Irma’s Garden, LaGrippe Orchid Garden, Kapnick Hall, Berger Shop in the Garden and the Fogg Café. A redesign of the Scott Florida Garden was completed in December 2016. Today the Garden welcomes over 260,000 visitors per year to experience themed gardens that represent the culture and flora of the tropics.\nNaples Botanical Garden Board of Directors\nNaples Botanical Garden Executive Staff\nNaples Botanical Garden 2024 Annual Report\nContact Us\nJoin Our Email List\nLocation\n4820 Bayshore Drive\nNaples, FL 34112\n239.643.7275\nHours of operation\nJune 1 – September 30\n8am – 2pm daily\nTickets\nAdults: $27\nChildren: FREE\n(17 & under)\nMembers: FREE\nBuy Tickets\nQuick Links\nFogg Café\nBerger Shop in the Garden\nHats in the Garden\nBlog\nVolunteers\nMembers\nEmployment\nExecutive Staff\nMedia\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivate Events\nWebsite Accessibility",

With behind-the-scenes access and a deep familiarity with its landscape, he has captured moments that might otherwise go unnoticed—a certain slant of light, a rare bloom, a quiet transformation. Much like photos, notes, and sketches are gathered on a refrigerator door, these informally presented pictures highlight Eder’s experience photographing the Garden’s Living Canvas.\nOn display July 19, 2025 – January 11, 2026 in Fogg Café.\nView the exhibit key\nAbout the Artist\nAfter 40 years of professional photography in New York City and Los Angeles, John Eder returned to Naples where he continues his profession by chronicling the Garden’s plant collection, people, and special events.\nLoading view.\nCalendar\nEvents Search and Views Navigation\nSearch\nEnter Keyword.
