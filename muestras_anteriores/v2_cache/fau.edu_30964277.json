Brady, Ph.D., served as chair of the Department of Special Education for 21 years. He was a son of the late M. Sgt. Donald E. Brady and Elizabeth D. Brady. Raised in New Jersey, Michael later lived in Hawaii, American Samoa, Tennessee, Texas, and Florida. He joined the faculty of Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in 2000. Brady’s scholarly record is long and prestigious. He published over 120 articles and made 160 professional presentations during his career. He exhibited rewarding grantsmanship, garnering over four million dollars to support teacher preparation and educational opportunities for adults with intellectual disabilities. In 2016, Brady and others started the Academy for Community Inclusion (ACI), a college certificate program for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. He also worked extensively to promote graduate education in special education, with a special emphasis on doctoral education. During his career, he chaired and/or served on 49 dissertation committees (25 at FAU). Professor Brady was voted the University Scholar of the Year in 2018 at FAU and the Senior Scholar by the Eastern Educational Research Association.\nBrady’s work was not confined to academics. He was an avid diver, widely known as a highly skilled scuba instructor, and certified by the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI). He also served as FAU’s scuba diving club advisor, and was recognized as Club Advisor of the Year in 2008. Most memorable is Brady’s strong advocacy for people with the most severe disabilities, his student-centered approach to any issue, and the fervor with which he approached mentoring many in his field. Mike is survived by his long-time partner Dawn Furlan, brother Donald E. Brady, Jr. (Laura Marshall) of Maryland, aunts, an uncle, cousins, a host of professional colleagues and friends. His absence will be mourned by his family, friends, and colleagues near and far.\nIn remembrance, you may donate to the\nDr\n.\nMichael P. Brady Memorial Scholarship for Doctoral Education in Special Education\n, which will support the education of students who share Mike’s passion for the education and treatment of folks with disabilities across the lifespan.

Throughout my tenure at FAU, I have been productive in many areas of research with emphasis on Tinnitus, Vertigo, Sound Sensitivity Disorders (such as hyperacusis and misophonia) and auditory behaviors and characteristics in Autism Spectrum Disorders. I have reached a level of global recognition in those fields where I receive continuous search for expert opinions from journals, grant foundations, post-doctoral evaluations, and scientific conventions. In the past five years, I have published 28 articles, many in high ranked journals, such as the\nJournal of the American Academy of Audiology, Ear & Hearing, and American Journal of Audiology\n. Additionally, I have presented more than 40 research and training presentations in state, national and international forums and conventions with 17 of them as an invited speaker. With the support from our college dean and my department chair, I currently have a research laboratory space dedicated to\nHearing, Tinnitus, Balance Research\n. With the funding from my grants I have been able to establish a laboratory which is now being equipped with several research tools (\nhttps://www.fau.edu/education/academicdepartments/csd/htbrl/\n) that will attract interested students and potential post-doctoral candidates for studying such topics in my laboratory.\nI have a collaborative nature when it comes to research and teaching. I have affiliate faculty appointments in many departments and colleges at FAU. These include college of Medicine, Department of Psychology, the FAU Neurology Residency program, the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences (as a dissertation committee member for doctoral students), and the Department of Otolaryngology, University of Miami. I am a faculty member for iBrain and iHealth at FAU. My international network of scientific collaboration is also quite extensive. For many years, I developed neural network models for tinnitus with my Japanese colleagues at the University of Tokushima. Additionally, my collaboration with researchers from the Surrey Hospital and Cambridge University in the UK has resulted in many publications in the areas of tinnitus and hyperacusis.\nIn general, I believe that I have been able to be an effective member of the FAU community. I am delighted to be selected as a featured person for this episode of faculty spotlight and I would like to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues and students at FAU.\nPUBLICATIONS: (2018 - 2021)\nAazh H,\nDanesh\nAA, Moore BCJ (2021).

Henderson University School Board Education Committee. I meticulously worked with the Dean and the Principal to establish a special education program and wrote the special education policy manual for the school.\nPresident - College of Education Faculty Assembly\nTHOUGHTS TO SHARE:\nI worship my work. Mentoring Holmes Scholars, meeting with them once a month, and noticing their growth in research productivity is awesome to share with other doctoral students in the COE. Two years ago, at the AACTE Conference in Baltimore, one of our Holmes Scholars came to me and said it was her first conference presentation. She was so excited for the opportunity that she thanked the Holmes Program with tears. My advice and guidance to students of color is to stay in school, stay focused, and get as much education as possible. If I can get a Ph.D. with my poor rural beginning, anybody can get an education and make it in life.

She teaches courses in curriculum and instruction, action research, and school reform. She received her Ed.D. in Curriculum and Instruction from the Department of Curriculum, Culture, and Educational Inquiry at Florida Atlantic University.\nAs a scholar, I define action research as a vehicle for change, a way to arm practitioners with data and give them the voice they need to engage in critical conversations with decision-makers. My work uses action research to focus on the intersection of teaching and researching, continually asking the question, ‘How do I improve my practice?’\nAs an action researcher, my practice and scholarship are inexplicitly linked to bolster my student’s experience in my courses as well as contribute pedagogical knowledge to the field of curriculum and instruction.\nNOTABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS:\nExcellence in eLearning Distinguished Achievement Award (2019), awarded by the Center for eLearning at Florida Atlantic University.\nInnovation in Higher Education Award (2017), awarded by Florida Distance Learning Association.\nExcellence in eLearning Faculty Award (2016), awarded by the Center for eLearning at Florida Atlantic University.\nTHOUGHTS TO SHARE:\nI have always been a teacher first. I believe it is necessary to have a deep understanding of your pedagogy, to comprehend the guiding values of your teaching thoroughly and how they manifest in relationships with students and the curriculum. When your values align with your instruction, students inevitably reap the rewards of excellent teaching. My work also argues that educational research should be conducted\nby\nand\nwith\nteachers to capture the perspectives that are often missing in the research informing educational policy\nPUBLICATIONS:\n1.\nVaughan, M\n.

Brady, Ph.D., served as chair of the Department of Special Education for 21 years. He was a son of the late M. Sgt. Donald E. Brady and Elizabeth D. Brady. Raised in New Jersey, Michael later lived in Hawaii, American Samoa, Tennessee, Texas, and Florida. He joined the faculty of Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in 2000. Brady’s scholarly record is long and prestigious. He published over 120 articles and made 160 professional presentations during his career. He exhibited rewarding grantsmanship, garnering over four million dollars to support teacher preparation and educational opportunities for adults with intellectual disabilities. In 2016, Brady and others started the Academy for Community Inclusion (ACI), a college certificate program for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. He also worked extensively to promote graduate education in special education, with a special emphasis on doctoral education. During his career, he chaired and/or served on 49 dissertation committees (25 at FAU). Professor Brady was voted the University Scholar of the Year in 2018 at FAU and the Senior Scholar by the Eastern Educational Research Association.\nBrady’s work was not confined to academics. He was an avid diver, widely known as a highly skilled scuba instructor, and certified by the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI). He also served as FAU’s scuba diving club advisor, and was recognized as Club Advisor of the Year in 2008. Most memorable is Brady’s strong advocacy for people with the most severe disabilities, his student-centered approach to any issue, and the fervor with which he approached mentoring many in his field. Mike is survived by his long-time partner Dawn Furlan, brother Donald E. Brady, Jr. (Laura Marshall) of Maryland, aunts, an uncle, cousins, a host of professional colleagues and friends. His absence will be mourned by his family, friends, and colleagues near and far.\nIn remembrance, you may donate to the\nDr\n.\nMichael P. Brady Memorial Scholarship for Doctoral Education in Special Education\n, which will support the education of students who share Mike’s passion for the education and treatment of folks with disabilities across the lifespan.

Throughout my tenure at FAU, I have been productive in many areas of research with emphasis on Tinnitus, Vertigo, Sound Sensitivity Disorders (such as hyperacusis and misophonia) and auditory behaviors and characteristics in Autism Spectrum Disorders. I have reached a level of global recognition in those fields where I receive continuous search for expert opinions from journals, grant foundations, post-doctoral evaluations, and scientific conventions. In the past five years, I have published 28 articles, many in high ranked journals, such as the\nJournal of the American Academy of Audiology, Ear & Hearing, and American Journal of Audiology\n. Additionally, I have presented more than 40 research and training presentations in state, national and international forums and conventions with 17 of them as an invited speaker. With the support from our college dean and my department chair, I currently have a research laboratory space dedicated to\nHearing, Tinnitus, Balance Research\n. With the funding from my grants I have been able to establish a laboratory which is now being equipped with several research tools (\nhttps://www.fau.edu/education/academicdepartments/csd/htbrl/\n) that will attract interested students and potential post-doctoral candidates for studying such topics in my laboratory.\nI have a collaborative nature when it comes to research and teaching. I have affiliate faculty appointments in many departments and colleges at FAU. These include college of Medicine, Department of Psychology, the FAU Neurology Residency program, the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences (as a dissertation committee member for doctoral students), and the Department of Otolaryngology, University of Miami. I am a faculty member for iBrain and iHealth at FAU. My international network of scientific collaboration is also quite extensive. For many years, I developed neural network models for tinnitus with my Japanese colleagues at the University of Tokushima. Additionally, my collaboration with researchers from the Surrey Hospital and Cambridge University in the UK has resulted in many publications in the areas of tinnitus and hyperacusis.\nIn general, I believe that I have been able to be an effective member of the FAU community. I am delighted to be selected as a featured person for this episode of faculty spotlight and I would like to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues and students at FAU.\nPUBLICATIONS: (2018 - 2021)\nAazh H,\nDanesh\nAA, Moore BCJ (2021).

Henderson University School Board Education Committee. I meticulously worked with the Dean and the Principal to establish a special education program and wrote the special education policy manual for the school.\nPresident - College of Education Faculty Assembly\nTHOUGHTS TO SHARE:\nI worship my work. Mentoring Holmes Scholars, meeting with them once a month, and noticing their growth in research productivity is awesome to share with other doctoral students in the COE. Two years ago, at the AACTE Conference in Baltimore, one of our Holmes Scholars came to me and said it was her first conference presentation. She was so excited for the opportunity that she thanked the Holmes Program with tears. My advice and guidance to students of color is to stay in school, stay focused, and get as much education as possible. If I can get a Ph.D. with my poor rural beginning, anybody can get an education and make it in life. With self-discipline, dedication and perseverance one can be whatever that person wishes to be.\nPUBLICATIONS:\nBooks\nRichards, S., Taylor, R.,\nRamasamy, R.\n(2014) Single subject research: Applications in educational and clinical settings (2nd ed.).

She teaches courses in curriculum and instruction, action research, and school reform. She received her Ed.D. in Curriculum and Instruction from the Department of Curriculum, Culture, and Educational Inquiry at Florida Atlantic University.\nAs a scholar, I define action research as a vehicle for change, a way to arm practitioners with data and give them the voice they need to engage in critical conversations with decision-makers. My work uses action research to focus on the intersection of teaching and researching, continually asking the question, ‘How do I improve my practice?’\nAs an action researcher, my practice and scholarship are inexplicitly linked to bolster my student’s experience in my courses as well as contribute pedagogical knowledge to the field of curriculum and instruction.\nNOTABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS:\nExcellence in eLearning Distinguished Achievement Award (2019), awarded by the Center for eLearning at Florida Atlantic University.\nInnovation in Higher Education Award (2017), awarded by Florida Distance Learning Association.\nExcellence in eLearning Faculty Award (2016), awarded by the Center for eLearning at Florida Atlantic University.\nTHOUGHTS TO SHARE:\nI have always been a teacher first. I believe it is necessary to have a deep understanding of your pedagogy, to comprehend the guiding values of your teaching thoroughly and how they manifest in relationships with students and the curriculum. When your values align with your instruction, students inevitably reap the rewards of excellent teaching. My work also argues that educational research should be conducted\nby\nand\nwith\nteachers to capture the perspectives that are often missing in the research informing educational policy\nPUBLICATIONS:\n1.\nVaughan, M\n.
