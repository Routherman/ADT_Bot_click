      "text": "About Us\nThis site is a tribute the late Tobacco Road bar of Miami.\nConsidered Miami’s Oldest Bar, The Road had survived several Miami land booms, Al Capone, Prohibition, the Great Depression, the country at War, deadly hurricanes, Mariel Boatlift, race-riots, cocaine cowboys, and the rise and fall and rise of South Beach. The Road had been a speakeasy, gambling den, gay bar, strip joint and blues bar. The two-story structure remains virtually unchanged since its inception in the early 1900s. And while ownership had changed over the years, the primary purpose of the establishment – a neighborhood watering hole always remained the same.",
