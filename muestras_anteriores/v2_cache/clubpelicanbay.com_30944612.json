Club Pelican Bay features 27 holes of championship golf presented as three 9-hole courses aptly named Club, Pelican and Bay. Situated on nearly 240 acres, Club Pelican Bay is anchored by the 50,000-square-foot, Florida Vernacular-inspired Clubhouse, completed in 2017, which houses multiple dining venues for Members and their guests. Complementing the Clubhouse are the new Spa & Fitness Center, Golf Shop and locker rooms.\nEnd Mini-Page 20094\nStart Tabs\n3.4.1\n1970s\n1980-1983\n1988-1990\n1989\n1991\n2001\n2017\nBegin Mini-Page 20289\nThe Beginnings of Pelican Bay\nFrom its inception, the designs and plans for Pelican Bay were targeted at creating a community of exceptional quality, with lifestyle standards second to none. During the planning and design stage, environmental concerns regarding pollution of the air, destruction of our natural waterways, and the disappearance of many species of wildlife were being voiced by many conservation groups throughout the country, leading in part to Florida's 1973 Wetlands Act.\nWhile the planning process for Pelican Bay had, from its inception, been sensitive to the environmental issues of the property under development, the environmental legislation of 1973 put meaningful emphasis on the design aspects of the new community, as it interfaced with the natural beauty of the mangrove forests and the flow of the natural waterways, so unique to Pelican Bay. The design of the golf course became a priority, given its role in the water retention plan and its importance in the design of the new community.\nOn December 28, 1979, a small gathering of foursomes assembled to \"test run\" the new course.\nEnd Mini-Page 20289\nBegin Mini-Page 20290\nThe Club Takes Shape\nThe first building to be finished was The Cart Barn, which housed a small pro shop and a snack bar. Clubhouse expansion progressed in three phases from 1980 to 1983. In November 1982, Phase III, the construction of the main Clubhouse facility, commenced, including the sinking of pilings to support the cantilevering of the New Main Dining area and surrounding terraces over the lake facing what was then the eighteenth fairway and green. By November of 1983, Phase III, which was referred to as \"The New Clubhouse,\" was completed.\nEnd Mini-Page 20290\nBegin Mini-Page 20291\nThe Aetna Challenge\nIn 1988, Club Pelican Bay hosted the inaugural edition and first of three years of the Aetna Challenge, now known as the Chubb Classic. Gary Player would go on to win the inaugural event, followed by Gene Littler in 1989 and Lee Trevino in 1990. The Aetna Challenge brought some of the biggest names to the Club, including the aforementioned champions and The King himself, Arnold Palmer.\nEnd Mini-Page 20291\nBegin Mini-Page 20292\nClub Pelican Bay Adds a New Nine\nOn February 23, 1989, Westinghouse announced its decision to construct a third nine at Club Pelican Bay. This addition would give the Membership 27 Championship holes of golf designed by Art Hills. The decision by Westinghouse to commit land to a third nine for the Club was the result of negotiations and discussions between WCI and the Pelican Bay Property Owners Association.\nThe PBPO Association President Fred Hard and Vice President Bernie Young were also members of the Club and shared concerns for both the community and the Club. Their leadership and pursuit of critical issues in regard to the allocation of \"green space\" and population density in the community would benefit not only the Members of the Club but all who lived in Pelican Bay.\nEnd Mini-Page 20292\nBegin Mini-Page 20293\nThe Founding Board\nBy the late 1980s, conversations had begun in earnest to explore a turnover in ownership of the Club from WCI to the Membership, and on May 16, 1990, an \"Agreement in Principle\" had been reached. On March 5, 1991 the Founding Board of Governors held its first meeting.\nEnd Mini-Page 20293\nBegin Mini-Page 20294\nThe Club Enters the 21st Century\nThe five years from 1995-2000 were an active period of accomplishment that prepared the Club to enter the New Millennium with a revitalized and reconditioned 27-hole golf course and an expanded and modernized Clubhouse. For the second time in ten years, the administrative offices were housed in trailers in the parking lot, and the process of demolition and construction began. On New Year's Eve, December 31, 2000, the Members toasted the arrival of The New Millennium, and on January 26, 2001, they held the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony for their newly renovated Clubhouse.\nEnd Mini-Page 20294\nBegin Mini-Page 20295\nNew Clubhouse Opens its Doors\nIn 2015, Club Pelican Bay Members made the bold decision to tear down all existing buildings and create an elegant, warm and timeless setting for themselves and their guests to enjoy.\nThe $33 million project featured a new 50,000-square-foot, two-story Clubhouse, expanded outdoor seating overlooking the golf course, and the Club’s first Spa & Fitness Center.\nThe new Clubhouse opened its doors to the Membership in the fall of 2017. Another building housing the new Golf Shop and locker rooms opened in Summer 2018.\nEnd Mini-Page 20295\nEnd Tabs\nend one-column\nEnd Dynamic Page / ID: 31\n707 Gulf Park Dr, Naples, FL 34108\nPhone:\n(239) 597-1183\n© 2025 Club Pelican Bay.
