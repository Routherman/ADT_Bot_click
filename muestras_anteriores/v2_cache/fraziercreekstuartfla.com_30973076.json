      "text": "Martin County's 1st Brewstillery, Winery, and Cidery\nMartin County’s first Brewstillery, Winery, and Cidery. Located 500 feet west of Frazier Creek in Stuart, Florida, a city originally named Potsdam with German roots, Frazier Creek Brewing & Distilling Co. adds to the city’s brewing history. Founded by passionate professional brewers and home brewers, our love for sharing the highest quality libations drives our craft in the brewery and distillery. Our mission is to enhance the quality of life in our community by providing the finest beers, seltzers, sodas, spirits, cocktails, specialty wines, and hard ciders by building upon the history established in beautiful Stuart, Florida.\nOur Story\nIn the fall of 2021 we formed our team and started our journey to open Frazier Creek Brewing and Distilling Company. All craft beer fans and entrepreneurs, we teamed up with internationally renowned Brewmaster and Master Distiller, Dan Rogers. With Dan's vast knowledge and expertise in operations, and the rest of the team's local knowledge, we developed a vision and plan for our Brewstillery. Several months later we found our location in The Creek Arts & Entertainment District in Historic Downtown Stuart, Florida, appropriately named after the same Frazier Creek as the Brewstillery. After working with local architects, engineers, and contractors, we began construction in the Summer of 2022. With nearly a year of construction, much of which we completed ourselves, we turned the former grocery store, movie theater, and office space, into a 9,000sf Brewstillery including a 3,500sf Brewery Taproom and 800sf Cocktail Lounge.\nNearly 2 years after opening we were awarded as The Best New Brewery in the US by USA Today!\nDrone footage courtesy of Ned Hibberd\nBrewmaster & Master Distiller\nDan Rogers\nDan Rogers is a Detroit, Michigan native who received his professional brewing start in 1992 when he opened the 1st craft brewery in Las Vegas. He won his 1st Great American Beer Festival medal in 1993 and has been winning awards ever since. In 1998, Dan moved his family back to Michigan and continued his brewing career. The highlight of his award winning career was winning a World Beer Cup Gold Medal for an IPA and Silver for a DIPA in 2010, an unprecedented feat! Dan has worked with both small local craft breweries and larger regional production breweries, giving him the perfect experience to guide Frazier Creek Brewing & Distilling Company as we grow and expand our craft beer, spirits, sodas, and ready to drink cocktails.\nFrazier Creek Brewing & Distilling Co. promotes responsible enjoyment of our handcrafted beer and spirits.\nYou must be 21 years of age or older to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages.
