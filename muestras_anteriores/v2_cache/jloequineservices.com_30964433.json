I grew up volunteering for a horse rescue throughout middle and high school, and riding the local trails. Upon graduating high school in 2011, I was gifted my dream horse (rescue) Spirit. I was fortunate enough to take him to college with me. I attended the University of Central Florida where I studied Biology and competed on the school's equestrian team. While in school I worked as a horseback riding instructor in Orlando, teaching beginner and intermediate lessons to both children and adults. I taught both English and Western basics, but most of my riding experience is Western including horsemanship, reining, trail, pleasure, and speed events. Upon graduating in 2015, I moved back home to Palm Bay and worked for Brevard County as a Park Ranger, and later as an Inspector for Mosquito Control. I now work for Spalding Laboratories, a leader of biological fly control in the agricultural industry. I started Flatwoods Farm in 2018 to continue my passion for horses, nature, and teaching; and to finally have my heart horse, Spirit, at home. In 2023 I decided to further my education by becoming a certified Equine First-Aid Instructor, and expanded my business to include Equine First Aid classes.

We are not far from the Indian River Lagoon. Some wildlife that can be seen on our property and local trails include but are not limited to: white tailed deer, red tailed hawks, osprey, bald eagles, scrub jays, sandhill cranes, herons and storks, gopher tortoises, box turtles, bobcats, coyotes, snakes, pigs and more!
