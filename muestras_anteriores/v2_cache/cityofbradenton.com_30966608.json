      "text": "Reportable Events\nIf the City's wastewater system (including pipes, manholes, lift stations, or treatment plant) experiences a noncompliance event such as a spill, bypass, or water quality exceedance that endangers health or the environment, the City is required to report the incident within 24 hours of its discovery. This report is typically made via a written submission, though sometimes an initial report may be made by telephone. Additionally, as a permit holder under the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the City must file a detailed written report within five calendar days of discovering the event.\nHERE IS A RECORD OF THE CITY'S REPORTABLE EVENTS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS:\nSeptember 5, 2024\nOctober 13, 2024\nNovember 21, 2024\nApril 7, 2025\nJune 17, 2025\nAugust 28, 2025\nSeptember 6, 2024\nOctober 17, 2024\nNovember 24, 2024\nApril 11, 2025\nJune 19, 2025\nSeptember 2, 2025\nSeptember 10, 2024\nOctober 19, 2024\nDecember 6, 2024\nApril 17, 2025\nJune 20, 2025\nSeptember 17, 2024\nOctober 23, 2024\nDecember 10, 2024\nApril 24, 2025\nJune 25, 2025\nSeptember 19, 2024\nOctober 25, 2024\nJanuary 10, 2025\nApril 28, 2025\nJuly 9, 2025\nSeptember 20, 2024\nOctober 25, 2024\nJanuary 10, 2025\nApril 28, 2025\nJuly 18, 2025\nSeptember 23, 2024\nOctober 29, 2024\nJanuary 24, 2025\nMay 13, 2025\nJuly 25, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nNovember 5, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2025\nMay 28, 2025\nAugust 4, 2025\nOctober 2, 2024\nNovember 6, 2024\nFebruary 7, 2025\nMay 29, 2025\nAugust 7, 2025\nOctober 2, 2024\nNovember 12, 2024\nFebruary 14, 2025\nMay 30, 2025\nAugust 11, 2025\nOctober 4, 2024\nNovember 13, 2024\nFebruary 27, 2025\nJune 10, 2025\nAugust 18, 2025\nOctober 9, 2024\nNovember 17, 2024\nMarch 7, 2025\nJune 10, 2025\nAugust 20, 2025\nCity Departments\nAdministrative Services\nCity Administrator\nCity Clerk\nCommunity Redevelopment Agency\nFinance Department\nPlanning & Community Development\nPublic Works & Utilities\nSolid Waste Services\nDrinking Water\nParks & Recreation\nCity Projects\nClean Waterways\nReportable Events\nStormwater\nGrease Education\nPollution Reporting Guidelines\nReporting Requirements & Procedures for submitting a Public Notice of Pollution\nImportant Links\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection - Public Notice of Pollution\nFlorida Department of Health/Manatee County\nTampa Bay Estuary Program\nSarasota Bay Estuary Program",

Washing greasy pans, dishes, and utensils sends FOG down the drain, where it clings to the inside of pipes.\nOver time, this buildup narrows the pipe and restricts the flow of wastewater.\nThe result? Potential sewage overflows in homes or neighborhoods, creating not only a major inconvenience but also a serious health hazard.\nWhat Causes FOG?\nWhere FOG Originates\nSources of FOG:\nMeat fats (bacon, sausage)\nLard, cooking oil, butter or margarine\nFood scraps\nBaking products\nDairy products (milk, ice cream, yogurt, sour cream, cheese)\nMayonnaise, salad dressings, other condiments\nKeep these foods out of all drains!\nWhy is FOG a Problem?\nChallenges and Impacts\nOnce FOG is washed down drains, it meets cooler water temperatures and becomes solid. If not properly removed or prevented, this thickened FOG will travel into the sewer collection system where it will cling to pipe walls and attract other FOG particles and any other solids that encounter it. Over time, these buildups grow, restricting the flow of water to our Water Reclamation Plant.\nImagine a clogged artery in a human body—FOG acts the same way when it is in our collection system. As the blockage worsens, water is forced to find another route. This backup can lead to sewage being pushed back into your drains or out of manhole covers in roads and parking lots. When the untreated sewage spills in this way, it's called a Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO). These events are costly to clean up and expose people and the environment to harmful bacteria, viruses, and other hazards.\nGarbage disposals do not keep grease out of the plumbing system. These units only shred solid material into smaller pieces and do not prevent grease from going down the drain.\nHow can I prevent Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs) or Sewer Backups?\nResidents can help prevent FOG-related sewer overflows and clogs by reducing the number of grease-laden foods going down their drains. Less FOG down the drain equals less FOG in the sewer collection system.\nBusiness owners of grease-discharging facilities must install Grease Interceptors (GIs) that capture the FOG before it enters the public sewer system.  These can be purchased through GI manufacturers, and sizing suggestions should be calculated by a State-licensed plumber and submitted to the City of Bradenton Permitting Department before installation.\nNEVER\npour grease down sink drains or toilets.\nDispose of cooled cooking fats, oils, and grease by pouring them into a disposable container or onto a paper-lined surface to absorb, then place in the trash.\nScrape food scraps and grease from dishes and pans into the garbage before washing.\nUse sink strainers or baskets to catch food scraps and dispose of them in the trash.\nMinimize garbage disposal use.

This board votes on Certificates of Appropriateness for exterior alterations to or demolitions of historic buildings.\nMeetings:\nSecond Monday of every other month at 10 a.m. in the City Council Chambers, if needed\nMembers:\n6, including representatives from architecture, urban planning, historic preservation, landscape architecture and building/construction trade.\nTerm:\nThree years\nAdditional background: The City of Bradenton has two historic districts. They are the downtown area around the Historic Courthouse and the center of the old Village of Manatee around the intersection of Manatee Avenue East and 9th Street East.\nThe exterior alteration of a building and signage requires a Certificate of Appropriateness from the city’s Architectural Review Board (ARB). The demolition of buildings can in some cases require a Certificate of Appropriateness. Some changes to the exterior can be approved administratively without an ARB hearing.\nPlanned Development Projects containing buildings over 45 ft. in height and infill projects exceeding 5 acres require a Design and Compatibility Review even if these projects are outside of the designated historic districts.\nThe ARB meets, if needed, on the first Monday of every month. Applicants can call 941-932-9422 with any questions.\nYou may also contact\n[email protected]\nfor any of these documents:\nHistoric District Map\nHistoric Preservation - Property Tax Exemption Application\nArchitectural Review Board Agendas & Minutes 2018\nArchitectural Review Board Agendas & Minutes 2019\nEndFragment\nArchitectural Review Board FAQs\nMayor & Council\nAbout Us\nCity Boards\nAffordable Housing Advisory Committee\nArchitectural Review Board\nBradenton Housing Authority\nCentral Community Redevelopment Agency Advisory Board\nCode Enforcement Special Magistrate\nFire Pension Board of Trustees\nMerit Personnel Board\nMPO Citizens Advisory Board\nNuisance Abatement Board\nPlanning Commission\nPolice Pension Board of Trustees\nTree & Land Preservation Board\nDowntown Parking\nNew Residents\nOnline Payments\nWebsite Policies\nCity Locations & Hours\nMayor Gene Brown\nWard One - Jayne Kocher\nWard Two - Marianne Barnebey\nWard Three - Kemp Schuessler\nWard Four - Lisa Gonzalez Moore\nWard Five - Pam Coachman\nBoard members\nCurrent members of the Architectural Review Board are Gene Bay, Andrew Kelly, John Moody, and Jason Taylor.
