      "text": "Our Story\nAn active retirement community that feels like family\nIn 1996, a group of residents joined forces, pooled their respective resources, and bought the Country Aire Estates Mobile Home Park, turning it into a Resident-Owned Co-Op run by the Homeowner’s Association or Board of Directors. The aim? To make the park a place where all profits go back into sprucing up the community, offering better services, and keeping costs down.\nBy purchasing “shares,” residents show their commitment to improving the park for everyone’s benefit. These shareholders have the power to vote in elections and on important decisions at Shareholder Meetings.\nShareholders can even throw their hats in the ring to run for the Board of Directors, join committees, or take on special projects as assigned by the Board.\nCountry Aire Estates boasts 120 Mobile Home sites eligible for “share” ownership. The price and availability of shares are determined by the Board of Directors. Owning a “share” shifts residents from paying lot rent to a monthly maintenance fee, often a cost-saving move. Since costs are adjusted periodically by the Board, shareholders may see changes to adapt to the cost of living.\nFacilities at Country Aire Estates include a clubhouse with a billiards room, library/card room, shuffleboard courts, swimming pool, fire pit, commercial grill, and a pond for catch-and-release fishing. Water and sewer services come from Country Aire Estates Service Corp, a separate entity managed by its own Board of Directors. The Service Corp oversees two wells, a water storage tank, and the sewer plant, located near a storage lot used by Country Aire Estates.\nFor more info on Country Aire Estates, call the HOA office at 352-567-3630 or send us an email at\ncae.mhp.hoa@gmail.com\n.\nOur Story\nAn active retirement community that feels like family\nIn 1996, a group of residents joined forces, pooled their respective resources, and bought the Country Aire Estates Mobile Home Park, turning it into a Resident-Owned Co-Op run by the Homeowner’s Association or Board of Directors.
