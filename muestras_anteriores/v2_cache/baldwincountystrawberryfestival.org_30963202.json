The festival was originally held in downtown Loxley, but in 1999 moved to its present location at the Loxley Municipal Park. This grassy, spacious location has allowed the festival to grow expand to include many more activities that had been limited by other sites. It also permitted the festival to extend into a two day event (Saturday & Sunday). In 2020 and 2021 the festivals and the events associated with the festival were unfortunately cancelled due to the Covid-19 virus restrictions which interrupted our continual yearly occurrence.\nIn the history of the festival a the Little Miss Strawberry Beauty Pageant was held in March before the festival. The pageant was open to second grade girls attending Baldwin County public or private schools. The participants were judged on poise, appearance, and personality by a panel of three qualified adjudicators. The Little Miss Strawberry Beauty Pageant was discontinued in 2021 due to Covid and the Baldwin County Strawberry Festival no longer holds this beauty pageant.\nThe Baldwin County Strawberry Festival welcomes and wishes EVERYONE in attendance a safe, responsible, and BERRY Good Time!\nFree Shuttle to Festival\nFree Shuttle service is provided from 9:00 AM to 5:00PM Saturday and Sunday. The shuttle picks up point is the Baldwin County Board of Education Building located at 1901 B Avenue and the Loxley Elementary School at 4999 S Magnolia Street, Loxley, AL. The shuttle brings you directly to the Baldwin County Strawberry Festival and operates continually throughout the festival hours.\nfusion-row\nAbout\n2025-08-16T10:00:06-05:00\nBaldwin County Strawberry Festival\nIn 1996, the festival date changed from the first Saturday in May to the present date, the second weekend in April.
