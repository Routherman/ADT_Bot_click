      "text": "About Cowart Ranch\nIn 1986, our family started Cowart Ranch and Farms’ first endeavors in Flagler County, Fl. by forming The Blueberry Strand.  Since then, we’ve branched into selling our very own grass-fed beef, pasture raised eggs, and our fall Maze Dayz event with operations growing pumpkins, sunflowers, and family activities.\nIn 2012 Dalton and Brittany Kinney introduced Agri-tourism into our west Bunnell farming community by hosting Flagler Counties first annual “Maze Dayz,” a fun annual fall harvest festival!! Since then it’s become a family tradition for many to gather. This year it is scheduled on weekends this Oct 4-Nov 2, and weekdays for scheduled school groups. It’s held at The Blueberry Strand,\nlocated at 8185 W. Highway 100 in Bunnell\n. Check our more information about this by clicking on the tab labeled\nMaze and Fall Festival.\nWe’d love to see smiles on your faces out here this year supporting your local farmers. Remember NO FARMS, NO FOOD!\nExperience the Best of Agri-Tourism\nFrom thrilling seasonal events to our cherished blueberry picking, Cowart Ranch and Farms offers a unique blend of agriculture and fun for everyone. Our commitment is rooted in creating memorable experiences that resonate with our community and visitors alike.\nWhere Farming Meets Community\nJoin us in celebrating the harvest!
