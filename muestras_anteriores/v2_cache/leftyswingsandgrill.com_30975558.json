Whether you’re here to catch the game, enjoy daily specials, or grab takeout, we’re always cooking up something delicious.\nContact Us\nRecommended\n2025\nLefty's Wings & Grill\nRestaurant Guru\nSupporting Local Businesses\nCustomer First Business\nLocally Owned Business\nGoogle Trusted Businesses\nOur Story\nLefty’s Wings & Grill began as a small local hangout with one big goal — to serve up the best wings in town with a side of genuine hospitality. Over the years, it’s grown into more than just a place to eat; it’s become a home base for families, sports fans, and loyal regulars who’ve made Lefty’s part of their routine.\nWith a reputation built on flavor, fun, and familiarity, Lefty’s has proudly earned its place in the hearts of the St. Lucie community. Now under new ownership, we’re honoring everything that made Lefty’s great from the beginning, while putting in the work to make it even better — from small updates behind the scenes to improvements in service, quality, and comfort. It’s still the same Lefty’s you know and love — just refreshed, recharged, and ready for the next chapter.\nOur Mission\nAt Lefty’s Wings & Grill, our mission is to create a place where great food, cold drinks, and good times come together. We’re here to serve up more than just award-winning wings — we’re serving the community with heart. From families and friends to sports fans and first-time visitors, everyone is welcome at our table. Our goal is to deliver consistently delicious meals, friendly service, and an atmosphere that makes you feel right at home, every time you walk through the door.\nOur Vision\nOur vision is to carry on the legacy that has made Lefty’s a beloved local favorite for over 20 years, while introducing thoughtful improvements to better serve our guests. Under new ownership, we’re investing in fresh ideas and upgrades — but we’re not touching the soul of the place. We want to remain the go-to neighborhood hangout where memories are made, sports are watched, and every visit feels like coming back to something familiar. As we grow, we’re committed to staying true to what Lefty’s has always stood for: great food, strong community, and a welcoming atmosphere for all.\nView Menu\nOrder Online\nLeave Review\nContact Us\nGOOD\nBased on\n1336 reviews\nShawn Doe\n2025-05-17\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\nR-CONTENT\nThe buffalo chicken sandwich was amazing.
