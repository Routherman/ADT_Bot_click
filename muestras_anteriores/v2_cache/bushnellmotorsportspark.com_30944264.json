      "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: Do I need a reservation for rental karts?\nA: You do not need a reservation to run our rental karts. Just show up anytime rentals are racing!\nQ: How old do you need to be to run the rental karts? Is there a height requirement?\nA: You need to be 16+ with a drivers license to do the adult rental karts and 10+ to do our Jr karts. 16 and 17 year olds need to bring their license with them to the track. There is no height requirement. It is all based off of age.\nQ: Is there a maximum weight restriction?\nA: No. Everyone is built different. We always recommend that you sit in one of our karts before buying any races to see if you will be comfortable for 10 minutes at a time. You must be able to fully buckle the seatbelt.\nQ: Does a permit count as a drivers license?\nA: The State of Florida requires all racers of the adult karts to be 16+ with a drivers license. Permits\ndo not\ncount. If you are 16 and 17 years of age, you need to bring your license with you to the track.\nQ: Can adults do the Jr karts with the kids?\nA: Yes you can! The karts are a little smaller than the adult ones but adults can fit!\nQ: Can I sign the waiver for a minor who is not my own?\nA: No. The legal parent or guardian must sign for the minor. You can download the waiver and have it signed by the legal parent or guardian and notarized before coming to the track.\nQ: How long is each race?\nA: Adult kart races are 10 minutes long (~5-7 Laps). Jr kart races are 8 minutes long (~8-12 Laps)\nQ: How fast do the karts go?\nA: The adult karts go ~40-45mph and the Jr karts go ~30mph\nQ: Can I share a 3 or 5 pack of races with other people?\nA: No. They are for individual use.\nQ: What happens when it rains?\nA: We do not run rental karts while it is raining. We wait for the rain to stop, and then blow the puddles off the track. Once the track is deemed safe, we get back to racing.\nQ: Is there food on site?\nA: We have basic snacks and drinks for sale.\nQ: Do you guys run Spyder MX?\nA: No, we do not.
