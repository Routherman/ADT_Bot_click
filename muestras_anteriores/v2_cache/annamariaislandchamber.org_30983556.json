From annual festivals like BayFest, Cortez Seafood Festival and Symphony on the Sand, to parades, outside markets, concerts and holiday festivities, there is at least one event a month for you to join in the celebration.\nEvents are held all year long with bits of history thrown in. Watch the Privateer’s “Skullywag” sail down the street while you enjoy the St Patrick’s Day, 4th of July, Veterans Day, or Christmas parades. Pull up a lawn chair and listen to live music at many of the festivals or shop the arts and crafts vendors on display. Stroll the streets, browse local shops while you enjoy the taste of sumptuous treats at the island ArtWalks. The Budweiser Clydesdale horses, including the dalmatian, have even been known to show up on Anna Maria Island for a stroll down Marina Drive.\nDuring the holiday season, enjoy festive tree lighting celebrations. Each of the island’s three cities has a Holiday Walkabout on a different weekend night in December, so you don’t have to miss a thing.\nDecorate a golf cart and enter a parade or just sit along the routes and catch beads and candy. Attend a festival or outdoor market. If you can’t locate an event during your stay, you may not be on Anna Maria Island. From the solemn to the whimsical, Anna Maria Island knows how to celebrate!\nView Community events\nView Chamber events\nAnna Maria Island\n5313 Gulf Drive,\nHolmes Beach, FL 34217\n941-778-1541\ninfo@annamariaislandchamber.org\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\n©\nAnna Maria Island Chamber of Commerce\n.\nAll rights reserved.\nDigital marketing by\nTwo Oceans Digital\n.\nSite Map\n|\nADA Website Compliance\n|\nPrivacy Policy\nPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of\nwebsite accessibility\nGoogle Tag Manager (noscript)\nEnd Google Tag Manager (noscript)",

Sit back, relax, enjoy the view and leave the driving and parking to someone else. Hop on and off as often as you like. Several trolleys loop the island from Coquina Beach on the southern tip in Bradenton Beach up to the City Pier in the City of Anna Maria on the northern end of the island on a daily basis. The trolleys also run on most holidays.\nEarly birds will be excited to know island trolley service starts at 6am from both ends of the loop. Trolleys typically run at 20 minute intervals until 9pm, then every 30 minutes until 10:30pm. (times may vary due to unforeseen incidents, traffic conditions or weather) You’ll never be far from a trolley stop, you can usually find them every two to four blocks. With 35 northbound and 35 southbound trolley stops, it’s easy to get anywhere you want to go on the island.\nFor a list of all the trolley stops, route and time table, pick up an AMI Chamber of Commerce island map at the Chamber office, the visitor kiosk at Manatee Beach or at various businesses around the island.\nYou may also find a schedule on the MCAT site here.\nThe front of the trolley holds two single seat, two-wheeled bikes 16 inches or higher. It is easy to load your bikes on the rack, then unload them at any trolley stop and go exploring on your own. Be sure to take all your belongings when you get off the trolley. Should you leave something on the trolley, please contact MCAT lost and found at 941-747-8621.\nWe invite you to enjoy the free island air-conditioned trolley. Not only is it fun, but you will be helping reduce traffic and congestion on the island. Please read about our Trolley Giving Back Program to learn more about how it contributes to keeping the trolley free as well as giving back to the local community. If you find it in your heart to help, donations are gratefully appreciated. There are donation boxes on each of the trolleys.\nBeach ConneXion Shuttle\nThe newest trolley, the\nBeach ConneXion Shuttle\n, runs seasonally from December through April every year. This new service began December 2019 to help drivers avoid heavy beach traffic on Manatee Avenue going on and off Anna Maria Island during peak tourist season. The\nBeach ConneXion Shuttle\nwill operate on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, from 10am to 6pm.\nAs are all the trolleys on the Island, The\nBeach ConneXion Shuttle\nis also free! Pick up the shuttle at the sheltered Manatee County Area Transit bus stop at the northeast corner of Manatee Avenue and 75th Street West. There is plenty of parking in the commercial center there (Kmart/Publix center). No need to try and find a parking space on the Island, the shuttle will take you right to Manatee Public Beach! There are also several bus stops between Manatee Avenue/75th Street West and Manatee County Public Beach where passengers can get on or off the Shuttle at any of these stops as well.\nMainland transit connections to the new\nBeach ConneXion Shuttle\nare available via MCAT Route 3 which serves the Manatee Avenue corridor and operates Monday through Saturday, and the\nBeach Express\noperating along the same corridor on Sundays and holidays.\nPrefer to relax at Coquina Beach on the south end of the island? Board the\nBeach ConneXion Shuttle\n, travel to AMI, and make a connection to the southbound AMI Trolley at Manatee County Public Beach.  The AMI Trolley, which operates every 20 minutes (depending on traffic conditions), will take you to the main entrance by the beach café at Coquina Beach. Be sure to download the\ntrolley app\nto track the trolley’s whereabouts and its expected arrival or departure time for your stop.\nTrolley App\nWant to know where the trolley is in real time, how long it will be before it gets to your stop, or where the nearest trolley stop is? You can now find the trolley (or any other Manatee County Area Transit Bus) on your phone!\nDownload the myStop software application on your mobile device. The myStop app can be accessed using the\nApple Store\nor\nGoogle Play Store\n. Select Manatee County as the transit authority, and identify your trolley/bus route and stop in the app. You can set up optional notifications for trolley arrivals at your designated stop.\nOnce your preferences are set to the AMI Trolley Route, a map of the whole island with all the trolley stops and icons showing the current trolley locations will be displayed. It’s that easy! Make the most of your time on the island and plan your day using the app to receive real-time trolley information as travel conditions vary day to day, especially during peak tourist season when island traffic is heavier.\nYou can also track the trolley from any trolley stop without the app if you have a QR code reader on your phone. Scan the QR code at a particular stop and it will provide the arrival time for each trolley servicing that specific stop.\nFor non-techie folks, you can call MCAT at 941-749-7116 during their regular business hours, 7AM to 6PM, Monday through Friday, for real-time information on the trolley.\nAnna Maria Island\n5313 Gulf Drive,\nHolmes Beach, FL 34217\n941-778-1541\ninfo@annamariaislandchamber.org\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\n©\nAnna Maria Island Chamber of Commerce\n.\nAll rights reserved.\nDigital marketing by\nTwo Oceans Digital\n.\nSite Map\n|\nADA Website Compliance\n|\nPrivacy Policy\nPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of\nwebsite accessibility\nGoogle Tag Manager (noscript)\nEnd Google Tag Manager (noscript)",
