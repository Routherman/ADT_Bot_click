Came here to paddle board with foster kids in the boating area and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They were sure to keep everyone safe and make it an enjoyable time. Interested in coming back for sure.\nJessica Love\nMy boyfriend and I visited the complex on our vacation to Orlando. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It was a half day event with a quick lesson and rentals included. We were both able to get up on our first try and the cables were not very busy so we were able to get on whenever we wanted!\nMelanie Gainsworth\nWhat an amazing experience! We took six kids ranging from 11-18 that have never tried any type of kneeboarding or wake boarding. We spent all day and loved every minute of it. Staff was super friendly and extremely helpful, giving us tips on how to get up on the boards and take the turns. So much better than a day at an amusement park! We never had to wait more than a few minutes for our turn to go again. Definitely worth it.\nChristine Romanelli\n407-251-3100\n8615 Florida Rock Rd\nOrlando, FL 32824\nFIRST TIME\nACTIVITIES\nCAREERS\nCOMMUNITY\nMEMBERSHIP\nGIFT CARDS\nOnline Waiver\nNotary Waiver\nSafety Video",
