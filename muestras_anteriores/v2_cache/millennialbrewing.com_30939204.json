Ever.\nEnd Section 2\nStart Section 4 Custom section\nKyle Cebull - Founder - I've loved beer for as long as I can remember.  Once I paired up with a skilled brewmaster, everything fell right into place.  I served our country for five years as a Sergeant in the USMC right outside Washington, DC.  I followed that up with 10 years of being immersed the SWFL business market, making connections, and helping people.  All of my previous experience with leadership and business lead me right into starting Millennial Brewing. I was born in Sandusky, OH (home of the famous Cedar Point) and moved to SWFL when I was six years old.  I have always loved Southwest Florida and appreciate it more each day.  I enjoy golfing, boating and hanging out at the beach with the family.  I have two beautiful children, Kyle Jr. and Amelie.  They are my motivation, my everything and my hope is to create something that they will be just as proud of as I am.  That's why Millennial Brewing exists.  To create more than just a group of \"regulars\" that hang out at the brewery, to create a singular community of people that are just as committed to the community and the art of brewing as we are.  In that way, and as a direct result of its community, Millennial Brewing will be unlike any other brewery in the world.  We are so excited to share our dream with each and every one of you.\nMillennial Brew Team Brewer – Ralph Sprandel Jr. -The Millennial Brew team is like none other in the state.  Our Brewer, Ralph Sprandel Jr., is a self-taught, passionate curator of craft beer production.   He served our country in the United States Marine Corps, and then our community as a Lee County Sheriff Deputy.   Now, he expresses his love for beer right here in the Millennial brewhouse and crafts recipes that are true to style with his own unique flavor.   We are so excited to have him take the helm and lead us into the next evolution of our beverage offerings.\nMillennial Customer Experience Team - Our customer experience team leads the front of house operation with ease and skill.
