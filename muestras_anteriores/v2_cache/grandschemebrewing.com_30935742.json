Please drink responsibly. — MGMT\nTHE STORY\nNot long ago, we asked ourselves how we might best embody the American dream, and make a few bucks at the same time. It occurred to us then that nothing is more American than a scheme, and thus, GSB was born.\nIt works like this: We take your money, and give you beer. Beer we make here, at the brewery, for less money than you give us to drink the beer. When we run out of beer we make more. It’s a perfect system.
