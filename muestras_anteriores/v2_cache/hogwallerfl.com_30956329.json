      "text": "ABOUT HOG WALLER\nThe Land & The Hog\nThe story of Hog Waller begins many years ago. The area surrounding Hog Waller is an old logging community named Rodman that was booming in the early 1900's. Many thousands of acres of forest land were harvested and many farms surrounded the community. The main source of food for these families was the over abundance of wild hogs, not to mention a major nuisance to the loggers who worked the woods. The lore of a monstrous hog who tormented the farmers and loggers in the community grew over time, and many wild tells were spun about how this hog became the hunter and not the hunted.  As time moved on, the community did too, and all that is left are a few building foundations, the stories of days gone by, and the mystery of this hog who made his home in those woods. On a cold, quiet night, many people say they have heard a strange sound of a hog off in the distance, and many say, the beast is still alive.\nHog Waller Today\nToday, Hog Waller is a 1100 acre outdoor family fun park. Hog Waller is owned by a local Putnam County family, and is open year around! Each month you can find many people riding through the woods on ATVs and UTVs or braving the huge mud pit with specially built trucks and cars. Hog Waller has bathing facilities, restrooms, and vendors who provide food, clothing, snacks, and even supplies for your vehicle or ATV.
