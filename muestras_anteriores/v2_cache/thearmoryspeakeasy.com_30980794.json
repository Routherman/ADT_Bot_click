It became a mission.\nTucked behind a guard shack and through a brick bunker tunnel, The Armory Speakeasy now stands as a tribute to the men and women who have served, and a stylish gathering place that reflects the\ndiversity, strength, and unity of America\n.\nWe serve more than food and cocktails.
