We accept and sell donated items for multiple reasons and with many benefits!\nOur stores generate revenue that allow Goodwill to offer free employment and career services.\n93¢ of every dollar earned in our retail stores supports programs and services.\nMany Southwest Floridians want to work, but they need help identifying their skills or abilities, finding employment, and learning how to succeed long-term.\nGoodwill provides services to job seekers, those who want to advance in their career (including our own employees), and employers throughout our area who need to fill permanent, full-time positions that offer benefits and a career path.\nThanks to our retail stores,\nGoodwill diverts about 30 million pounds of items from our landfills every year.\nMany items that can’t be offered for sale in our stores or online are sold for recycling, further funding our programs and services.\n5 Fun Facts You Should Know about Goodwill SWFL!\n1\nThis is John, our CEO.\nLike other nonprofits, Goodwill is managed by respected business leaders and a volunteer board of directors which provides guidance. Goodwill isn’t “owned” by anybody.\nOur CEO, John Nadeau, has been with Goodwill for more than 13 years holding senior-level management positions throughout his career. Nadeau also has 23 years of extensive experience running and operating an upscale retail grocery store. Nadeau’s combined years of experiences make him very proficient in both the nonprofit and for-profit sectors.\nIs he making a million dollars each year? No, but he is fairly compensated for someone who has a great deal of experience and the responsibility of managing more than 1000 employees and ensuring that one of Southwest Florida’s largest nonprofits is fulfilling its mission.\n2\nOur stores are designed to support our mission services.\nA lot of folks think our stores are just places that sell used items to people who have low incomes. While we’re happy we can provide affordable goods, our stores do so much more. When we sell those items, the money we raise goes toward the many programs and services we provide in Southwest Florida.\nSo, just like a hospital auxiliary thrift store helps the community through the hospital, a Goodwill store helps the community through all of those services that Goodwill provides.\n3\n93¢ of every dollar we earn goes back to our mission.\nany charities spend a high percentage of their income on overhead and fundraising. We don’t. When you shop in our stores or\ndonate\nto Goodwill, 93% of that money goes back into our\nmission services.\nSure, overhead expense isn’t the only way to judge a responsible charity, but it is important. And so is this: Guidestar by Candid, which rates nonprofits for donors and grantors, gives us their top rating – Platinum.\nNationwide,\nGoodwill is rated an “A” grade by Charity Watch\n, and for the last 5 years has been named one of the country’s\n“20 Most Inspiring Companies” in Forbes Magazine.\n4\nThis year, we helped someone you know.\nMaybe their son or daughter attends our\nPathways to Opportunity\nadult day-training. Maybe we helped them write a resume or we showed them how to interview for a job. Maybe they were at risk of dropping out of school and we helped them explore vocational careers. Maybe they attended our small business training\nMicroEnterprise\ncourses. Or maybe they live in one of our safe, affordable apartments.\nLast year, our many programs and services helped more than 23,000 folks here in Southwest Florida.\n5\nAll of our employees in SWFL earn at least the federal minimum wage.\nThat applies to every one of our 1,000+ employees, who earn the Florida State minimum wage.\nWhile some Goodwill organizations are among the 3,400 employers nationwide that use the federal minimum wage exemption to provide employment support to people with very severe disabilities, here in Southwest Florida, we do not.\n(Read more about how some Goodwill agencies utilize the exemption).\nCorporate Compliance Manual for Goodwill Industries of Southwest Florida, Inc.\nUser Agreement & Privacy Policy\nTax Deductions\nAccessibility\nFacebook\nFacebook\nFacebook\nFacebook\nFacebook\nOpportunity Center\n5100 Tice Street\nFort Myers, FL 33905\n(239) 995-2106\n©\n2025\n.

As you open your pockets to do a good thing and make yourself feel good, please keep these facts in mind…”\nThe message then quotes erroneous information and salary figures for several nonprofit organizations’ chief executives, including a reference to a so-called,\n“Goodwill CEO and Owner Mark Curran, who profits $2.3 million a year.”\nThis information is erroneous.\nGoodwill has more than a century of experience at helping people with disabilities and other barriers to employment in the U.S., Canada, and 13 other countries. Goodwill is a leading social services enterprise, and consistently ranks among the nation’s top charities.\nWe Are A Nonprofit Organization\nNeither Goodwill Industries International nor Goodwill Industries of Southwest Florida are\n“owned”\nby anyone. Steven C. Preston is the actual CEO of Goodwill Industries International and reports to a volunteer Board of Directors. Locally, John Nadeau is the President & CEO of Goodwill Industries of Southwest Florida. He, too, reports to a volunteer Board of Directors.\nHere in Southwest Florida,\napproximately $.93 cents of every dollar is spent on our mission services\n. This is a very healthy number in the nonprofit world, and a solid indicator of our commitment to good stewardship of your donations. Goodwill adheres to a strong Corporate Compliance philosophy that demonstrates what our organization stands for, including its ethical, social, and environmental values.\nCorporate Compliance Manual for Goodwill Industries of Southwest Florida, Inc.\nThat is the one legitimate message this damaging hoax email contains. We also suggest that you\nlearn more about the charities you’d like to support\n. Make sure the organization you choose uses its revenue for charitable purposes that support a mission you believe in.\nWe encourage you to\nvisit Candid’s GuideStar website\n,\nwhich posts financial records and independent reviews of charities. There, you can review our IRS 990 form, required of most federally tax-exempt organizations. Goodwill Industries International is certified with the GuideStar Exchange Seal for its commitment to transparency.\nFor more information debunking this hoax email,\nvisit Snopes\n, a website dedicated to validating or debunking urban legends, Internet rumors, email forwards, and other stories of unknown or questionable origin.\nGoodwill Certainly Encourages You to “Think Before You Donate”\nUser Agreement & Privacy Policy\nTax Deductions\nAccessibility\nFacebook\nFacebook\nFacebook\nFacebook\nFacebook\nOpportunity Center\n5100 Tice Street\nFort Myers, FL 33905\n(239) 995-2106\n©\n2025\n.
