Your staff was spectacular, the food, drinks and decor set up was 1000% perfect.\nIf you would like me to put a review anywhere please let me know. Personally I think anyone NOT using your venue for a wedding our size is crazy!!\nMany many thanks\nKathy and Brian Schauer\nHi Amber,\nMy name is Gloria. On Saturday February 8, we celebrated my mother Debi’s birthday at Island Way Grill. When I arrived an hour before the event to decorate, I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing staff.\nRight away, they began working diligently to find the perfect color scheme that would complement the cake and decor I had brought. Two staff members, Britt and Tony, went above and beyond to make the event truly special. They meticulously arranged the cake table and all the guest tables with the appropriate linens and runners, creating a visually appealing and coordinated look. It was evident that their exceptional customer service made a significant difference in the overall success of the event.\nI will definitely be a repeat customer for our next celebration. I hope you can express my sincere appreciation to your staff for their outstanding efforts.\nBest wishes,\nGloria",
