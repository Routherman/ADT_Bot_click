Established in the early 1960s, this whimsical island is home to a lively group of playful spider monkeys, offering a unique blend of wildlife conservation, local history, and community spirit. Both locals and tourists cherish this slice of paradise as a symbol of ingenuity and the vibrant charm of Homosassa, FL.\nA Storied Past in Old Homosassa, Florida\nMonkey Island isnât just a quirky attractionâitâs a vibrant piece of Homosassa's history, embodying creativity, community, and a touch of whimsy. Its creation in the 1960s was an unintentional masterpiece that has since become a beloved family-friendly destination.\nThe Creation of Monkey Island\nIn the early 1960s, G. A. \"Furgy\" Furgason, a key figure in developing Homosassa, unintentionally created Monkey Island while addressing a navigational hazard in the Homosassa River. Upon returning from an overseas trip, he discovered a small, barren island had emerged outside his yard. Furgy transformed this âeyesoreâ into a captivating attraction by adding a lighthouse and, later, a group of mischievous monkeys originally brought to America to assist with polio vaccine research.\nThe Arrival of the Monkeys\nThe monkeys, known for their antics, were relocated to the island to create their own âAlcatraz.â Over the years, the island was landscaped with structures and trees, becoming a haven for the furry residents and a delight for visitors.\nA Beloved Community Landmark\nMonkey Island now stands as a vibrant reminder of Old Homosassaâs whimsical charm and commitment to preserving its history. Visitors can observe the monkeys from the shores or the Monkey Island Riverside Resortâs waterfront dining areas, learning about wildlife conservation while enjoying the monkeysâ playful antics.\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPhone: 352-628-2474\nEmail: info@historicmonkeyisland.com\n5297 S Cherokee Way, Homosassa, FL 34448\nWorking hours: 24/7\nFollow us",
