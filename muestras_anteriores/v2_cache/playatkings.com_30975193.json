Try your hand at your classic bowling, level up with one of the Mad Games, or customize your experience with  selfies taken right at the bowler console. The options are truly endless.\nBowling pricing varies by location and time of day find your location to learn more!\nFind a Location\nClassic Games\nClassic & Skill Games include games like:\nLow Ball:\nIn \"Low Ball\" bowlers try to knock down the least amount of pins possible. However, you must knock down at least one pin on each shot. If you throw a gutter on the first ball, you get a strike. Likewise, if you throw a gutter, or get no pins on your second ball, you receive a spare for that frame. Perfect game in \"Low Ball\" is a score of 20.\nOdd & Duck:\nThe player must bowl an odd number of pins, and not a strike. If the player knocks down an odd number of pins, the score is normally recorded. If the player knocks down an even number of pins or a strike or a gutter, the score will be zero.\nLast Pin Standing\n- The aim is to knock down as many pins as you can without hitting the head pin. To get a strike, hit all pins EXCEPT the head pin with the first shot! If you hit the head pin with your first shot, the frame is over and your score is zero! If you hit all pins but the head pin with the second shot, you get a spare. Max score is 300.\nMad Games\nMad Games are fun for all ages! You can bowl in a way that is easier to understand, faster to finish, and fun for all skill levels. Now you don't have to knock down the most pins to be a WINNER! Some of these games are:\nBattle on the Lanes:\nBattle on the Lanes - Destroy the castle of the opposing player/team and you win! Play lane vs. lane or team vs. team. The number of pins you knock down determines the stones thrown and the amount of damage done to the opponents. The more the bowler is expert, the less his stone is powerful. The available skill levels are Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.\nCharacter Factory:\nThe aim of the game is to create an avatar. Starting from a neutral model, the different parts of the character (body, legs, arms, head, pet) will be customized after each frame (5 frames/5 changes). At the end of the game, all the characters are displayed together.\nBowling FAQ\nDo you have candle pin bowling?\nWhile we do not have candle pin lanes, all Kings locations have 10-pin bowling lanes with a variety of ball weights for kids and adults.\nWhat is the price bowl?\nBowling is charged per person per hour.

Find your location\nhere.\nHow many guests can fit on a lane?\nEach lane can fit up to 6 guests.\nDo you have bumpers?\nYes, all lanes have bumpers.\nAre food and drinks available while bowling?\nYes, full-service dining is available at all lanes.\nAm I required to purchase/wear bowling shoes?\nFor your safety bowling shoes must be worn while bowling. However, if you choose to bring your own shoes you are not required to rent from Kings.  Shoe rental is $3 per pair.\nCan I bring my own bowling shoes and bowling ball?\nGuests can bring their own bowling balls, shoes or any bowling gear they desire.
