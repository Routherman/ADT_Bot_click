Impress clients, investors, or friends with golf events or custom fitting events at your local Club Champion studio.\nWe have the latest and greatest golf club technology from every major brand in the golf industry (and then some!) available at our stores. Even better, we use industry-leading technology like SAM PuttLab and TrackMan swing analysis to find the perfect fit for each of our customers.\nWhether it’s a sales meeting, a thank you to valued customers or employees, a fundraiser, or just a celebration, we can help you create a one-of-a-kind day for your guests. For more information, please email:\nThis email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n.\nFAQS\nHow much does it cost per person?\nWe do not charge per person; we charge an event fee that starts at $2,000. This covers a minimum of ten club fittings, at least one master fitter, complete rental of the fitting studio, use of our fitting technology, and all club follow-up. Additionally, we do require a minimum of ten club purchases.\nWhat other fees will I have to pay?\nSales tax and shipping. There is no tax on the event fee; you’ll only pay tax on the equipment purchased. Shipping is free if your group opts to pick their new clubs up from the store, but a nominal fee applies if we ship direct-to-home.\nWhat clubs can you fit for group events?\nWe suggest putters for group events. They are cost-efficient and they leave the hitting bays open for use while other guests wait to be fitted. We can also do driver or wedges for group fittings, though the time and cost commitment vary.\nCan we host an event during business hours?\nYes! We ask that you keep events toward the end of the day if you host during business hours.\nWill my guests leave with the clubs that day?\nUnfortunately, no; our custom building process takes about\n5-7 weeks\nto be completed and delivered.\nDoes Club Champion provide catering?\nWe do not, but you’re welcome to bring food and beverages from an outside vendor.\nEQUIPMENT COSTS\nHere are the Club Champion pricing tiers and equipment offerings for group events:\nPUTTER FITTINGS\nTier 1: Scotty Cameron Super Select - $450\nTier 2: Taylormade Spider GTx - $350\nTier 3: Odyssey White Hot Versa - $260\nPrices reflect the cost of the putter and a\ncustom grip, before taxes\nDRIVER FITTINGS\nTier 1: Taylormade Stealth 2 - $860\nTier 2: Cobra AeroJet - $810\nTier 3: Srixon ZX5 and ZX7 MK II - $760\nPrices reflect the clubhead, a shaft\nfrom the Mitsubishi C6 range and a\ncustom grip, before taxes\nWEDGE FITTINGS\nTier 1: Titleist SM9 - $570\nTier 2: Mizuno S23 - $530\nPrices reflect the clubhead, a shaft from the True Temper Dynamic Gold range and a custom grip for a set of TWO WEDGES, before taxes\nPlease note: these brands are subject to availability and may change.

Club purchases are made at the event, after fittings are completed.\nEquipment customizations like stamping and/or paint fill are available on putters and wedges for $5 per character.\nBOOK YOUR EVENT TODAY\nEmail for more information or to book your event:\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

      "text": "THE CLUB CHAMPION STORY\nABOUT US\nPERFORMANCE IS OUR PROMISE\nEstablished in 2010, Club Champion has grown from a regional three-studio fitting business to a trusted golf club fitting expert with locations in every major golf market nationwide. Our Tour-level fittings were designed by Master Fitter and Builder Nick Sherburne, the company’s founder.\nNick found his way into golf club fitting in 1998 by helping out with club repairs and custom fitting at EJL Golf. With the advent of launch monitors, new shaft technology, grip updates and clubhead advancements, Nick shifted his mindset about fitting. No longer just an art, the science and technique of a proper fitting became a founding principle for the future of Club Champion.\nFormer CEO Joe Lee and former chairman Keith Bank partnered with Nick in 2010 to launch the budding brand. They saw potential in the idea that professional-level services were just as valuable to amateur players in the golf world — if we play the same equipment and wear the same clothing as the pros, we should be able to customize our game the same way as well. The business acumen of Joe and Keith combined with Nick’s passion and experience helped catapult the brand to the forefront of the fitting industry.\n“We went from a Chicagoland staple to a flourishing brand because we saw the huge difference fitted equipment can make in a golfer’s game and we’re making that improvement available to everyone through our expansion to markets across the U.S.,\" says Lee.\nA decade later, Club Champion employs over 220 team members, including roughly 150 fitters nationwide. We’ve been featured in CNBC, Forbes, Sports Illustrated, Golf Digest, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and more, and we are a perennial National Golf Foundation Top 100 company. We’re also a regular feature on Golf Digest’s semi-annual Top 100 fitter list, driven in part by the more than 100,000 fittings we complete per year.\nOur story is still being written, as we have plans for further expansion both in the U.S. and internationally.\nWE WENT FROM A CHICAGOLAND STAPLE TO A FLOURISHING BRAND BECAUSE WE SAW THE HUGE DIFFERENCE FITTED EQUIPMENT CAN MAKE IN A GOLFER’S GAME AND WE’RE MAKING THAT IMPROVEMENT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE THROUGH OUR EXPANSION TO MARKETS ACROSS THE U.S.\n”\nJoe Lee\nJoe Lee\nClub Champion Founder\n& Chairman",
