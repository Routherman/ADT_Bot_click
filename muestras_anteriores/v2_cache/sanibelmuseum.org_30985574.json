      "text": "About Us\nSanibel Historical Museum & Village\nSanibel Historical Museum and Village was founded in 1984 with a mission to preserve and share Sanibel’s history. The story of Sanibel is told from the Calusa and Spanish eras to the early pioneer families who settled on the island in the 1800s. It tells of warriors, adventures, fishermen, farmers and proprietors.\nNine historic buildings were moved from their original sites. Each building has been restored to its original state. We also have a replica of a Packing House and a garage housing a 1927 Ford Model T truck. Volunteer docents share the stories of Sanibel with almost 10,000 visitors a year. Join us as we follow the footsteps of the past.\nOur Mission:\nThe Sanibel Historical Museum and Village’s mission is to preserve, share, and celebrate Sanibel’s history.",
