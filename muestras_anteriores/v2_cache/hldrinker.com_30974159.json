They provide what is often overlooked by other bartending companies. Accommodating client’s needs and delivering top notch service are key components that Chris and Stacy did correctly from the company’s inception.\nStacy and Chris consistently attend industry related expos and events. Hook Line and Drinker team members are also full-time bartenders at busy, mixed demographic establishments that keep them sharp on new drinks and techniques.\nRecognized for their expertise and fun attitude, 4 short years later, Hook Line and Drinker is one of the preferred vendors at many of the venues in the Tampa Bay area including The Barn at Lone Oak Acres in Parrish, Florida and Lithia Acres in Lithia, Florida\nExceeding expectations and viewing each event from the hosts perspective, Hook Line and Drinker regularly receives 5-star reviews on Google and Facebook. Proving their desire for nothing short of excellence easily separates them from the competition.\nFooter Start\nCopyright Footer START\nSite Copyright Text START\n© 2025 Hook Line and Drinker.
