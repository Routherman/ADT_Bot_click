As leaders, they are committed to protecting the Town of Esto assets through the encouragement of residents and businesses to become integral participants in our community.\nThe Esto Town Council is composed of five elected town-wide representatives. The Council President position is selected by the Council Members each January. Council Members serve three-year, staggered terms. Staggering the terms of council members helps ensure continuity of the Council and allows for more seasoned members to continue to serve as newer members are elected into the roles.\nAs the legislative branch of the Town of Esto government, the Town Council holds open public meetings where local laws, policies, and decisions for the town are discussed and decided.\nNotice for all public meetings, along with agendas, are posted in advance of the meeting. Minutes are posted after meetings have concluded.\nTown Council meetings are held at 6:00 PM every 3rd Tuesday of the month at the Esto Town Hall located at 3312 2nd Avenue South, Esto, FL 32425.\nIn accordance with the provisions of F.S. Section 286.0105, should any person seek to appeal any decision made by the Council with respect to any matter considered at this meeting, such person will need to ensure that a verbatim record of the proceedings is made; which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to be based. In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, persons needing special accommodation to participate in the proceedings should call the Esto Town Hall at (850) 263-6521 no later than four (4) days prior to the proceeding for assistance.\nEsto Town Council Members\nPhyllis Reif\nTown Council – Seat 1\nGreg Wells\nTown Council – Seat 2\nHeather Huckaby\nTown Council -Seat 3\nJoshua Davenport\nTown Council – Seat 4\nTeresa Harrison\nTown Council – Seat 5\nPAGE CONTENT : end",
