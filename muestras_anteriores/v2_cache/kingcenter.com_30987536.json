In reality, ticket sales revenue only covers 60% of expenses such as artist fees, production costs, building upkeep and operations on average.\nAs a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit arts organization, the King Center relies on support from individuals and the community. Your tax-deductible donation will help the King Center cover increasing operating expenses and allow the arts to thrive in Brevard County.\nDid you know many companies have programs in place to match their employees' charitable giving? These matching funds can have a huge impact! Check with your HR Department on how you can make a matching gift possible. We truly appreciate the time it takes for you to initiate the process and thank you for making the arts a reality for Brevard County!\nGift Certificates\nUnsure of how to help the King Center but hope to see a show with us soon? Gift Certificates never expire and can be used toward tickets to any future show.
