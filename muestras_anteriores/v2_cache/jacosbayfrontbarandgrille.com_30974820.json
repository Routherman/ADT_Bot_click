The good was excellent as always, but the best part was the service, I’ve worked in the industry for 10 years and Ariel, our server, was one the best most genuine I’ve ever had. Absolutely phenomenal all around. Will definitely come back.\n/ .quote\nJohn Corsair,  TripAdvisor\n/ .review-by\n/ .review-slide\nFantastic!!!\nI had the ahi tuna and it was delicious! It came with sautéed and then lightly tempura spinach as well as creamy wasabi mashed potatoes! It was like a dream come true. Sushi without having to deal with rice!!! Yes!!! There was also some delicious reduction with it. Three thumbs up!! I usually don’t finish my dinner and give some of my left overs to my husband in an attempt to be “cute” (please don’t judge).  Yeah, that did not happen at all with this meal. We also got a flat bread which was to die for. Our cocktails were both very good as well, but I don’t think anything will ever trump that tuna!\n/ .quote\nJamie S., Yelp\n/ .review-by\n/ .review-slide\nDay on the water\nWe are from out of town and was looking for a good place to eat on the water. Definitely made a good choice! We had the tuna Reuben and a burger and fries and both were cooked perfect and seasoned well! We loved it!!! Could not have picked a better place. Food good, right on the water, and our server Ariel did a wonderful job! She was quick, friendly, and always kept our drinks full! Would recommend!\n/ .quote\ns-lauren-eddie, Urbanspoon\n/ .review-by\n/ .review-slide\nGreat food\nGreat food lovely view a place you and friends can have a wonderful time.\n/ .quote\nRalph Thompson, Google +\n/ .review-by\n/ .review-slide\n/ .slides\n/ reviews-rotation\n/ .sidebar.threecol\n/ .row\n© 2024 Jaco’s Bayfront Bar and Grille.
