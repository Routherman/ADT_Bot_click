Our other spaces include an intimate 300-seat Studio Theatre; a gorgeous Crown Club lounge where Crown Club members enjoy exclusive benefits; and a spacious rotunda available for receptions, corporate functions, and other special events.\nOur hidden gem is the\nStudio Theatre\n, seating between up to 300 guests. A more intimate venue, it is an ideal space for club-like concert events, comedy, or private functions. Located past our main lobby entrance, the Rotunda serves as the main lobby and gathering space specifically for the Studio Theatre space. Patrons will have access to concessions offering full liquor bar and snacks, and private bathrooms separate from the main hall.\nOur Mission\nTo improve the quality of life for all residents of Brevard County through cultural, educational, recreational, and community arts programs, by providing access to high quality, challenging, and diverse touring and local performing arts events.\nHistory\nThe Maxwell C. King Center for the Performing Arts opened its doors in 1988. Since that time, it has had a profound impact on the cultural and artistic landscape of Brevard County and Central Florida. The need for a performing arts center in Brevard County had been apparent for many years. Periodically, task forces were formed to try to garner the necessary funds, but each time the costs were deemed prohibitive and the idea was abandoned.\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Maxwell C. King, former president of Brevard Community College, the means to achieve this goal became a reality. Enrollment patterns at BCC indicated that south Brevard was evolving into the population center of the area. As the Melbourne campus of BCC began to reflect a pattern of growth, the college was then able to justify the construction of an auditorium—one that would not only fulfill the needs of the college but also the long-identified cultural needs of Brevard County. The 1983 Florida State Legislature provided the funds for preliminary planning and design work for the center. Subsequent legislative funding for construction became available in 1985 and 1986 for the $12.3 million facilities.\nThe Brevard Performing Arts Center was completed in the spring of 1988. Designed as a state-of-the-art, multi-use facility, the theatre offered a diverse array of programming, including popular artists, Broadway touring shows, classical artists, ballet and contemporary dance, opera, country music artists, family-oriented events, and children’s theatre.\nIn the summer of 1989, the Brevard Community College District Board of Trustees voted unanimously to rename the facility the Maxwell C. King Center for the Performing Arts in honor of the college’s president who had been instrumental in making the center a reality. The King Center continues to fulfill its mission to improve the quality of life on the Space Coast.\nIn 1990, the King Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. was designated a state cultural institution.\nStudio Theatre\nOur hidden gem is the\nStudio Theatre\n, seating between 280 and 300 guests. A more intimate venue, it is an ideal space for club-like concert events, comedy, or private functions. Past our main lobby entrance, the Rotunda serves as the main lobby and gathering space. Patrons will have access to concessions offering full liquor bar and snacks, and private bathrooms separate from the main hall.\nMore Info\nWhat our guests are saying\nAwesome venue for any type of show. Not a bad seat in the house!!\n...what a classy and great venue! If you are fortunate enough to attend a show here you will love this facility!!\nBeautiful facility, great shows, super staff!!\nThe Studio shows are small, intimate settings more like a club than the theatre seating next door. You could reach out and touch someone...but don't.\nWho benefits from the King Center?\nAll residents of Brevard County, the Space Coast, and Central Florida benefit from the King Center’s cultural events and programming.
