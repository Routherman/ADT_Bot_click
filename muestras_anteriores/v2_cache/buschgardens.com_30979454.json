You can feel good knowing you’re saving up to $2,355* on tickets, parking, and more. Because we love our Members and want you to get the most out of your experience throughout the year, we’re sharing a few tips to help you maximize every moment!\nSet up an Online Account\nYour online account will allow you to see many of the offers and rewards available to you throughout the year. You can also purchase discounted upgrades, including animal encounters and tours, all-day dining deals, and Quick Queue to get you to the front of the lines faster!\nStay in the Loop\nSign up for email using the same email address you used when you purchased your Membership. You’ll receive emails about exclusive Member offers and be the first to know about upcoming events!\nCheck out the Member Rewards page and monthly Member News blog for new rewards and other exclusives added throughout the year.\nClaim Your Rewards\nAfter setting up your account, you can log into the Member portal to redeem select rewards.
