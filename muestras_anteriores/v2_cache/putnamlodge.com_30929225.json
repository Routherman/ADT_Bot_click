From the moment you step inside, you feel like you’ve been transported back in time. The historic decor, especially the gorgeous pecky cypress walls, gives the lodge so much character. I loved learning about the history of the old timber company and the town of Shamrock. But don’t let the vintage vibes fool you—our room was outfitted with all the modern amenities we could want. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was spotless. The staff was warm and welcoming, making sure every need was met. Whether you're looking for a peaceful getaway or just appreciate history, this is a gem of a place to stay!\nSheila B.\nButton\nWe had our wedding at the Putnam Lodge, and it was everything we dreamed of and more! The setting is simply magical—the historic building, the beautiful woodwork, and the manicured grounds made for a perfect backdrop. Our guests were raving about how gorgeous and unique the lodge was. The staff went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect, from the ceremony to the reception. The food was fantastic—our guests still talk about it! If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines elegance with old Florida charm, Putnam Lodge is the place. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience!\nMelody T.\nButton\nPutnam Lodge was the perfect spot for a peaceful and relaxing weekend getaway. Tucked away in a quiet part of Florida, the lodge has this rustic charm that instantly makes you feel at home. The rooms were beautifully decorated, and the attention to detail was impressive. I loved the mix of modern comforts with the historic atmosphere. The restaurant on-site is a must-try—the food was delicious, and the service was top-notch. I spent time just wandering around the property, enjoying the gardens and soaking in the tranquility. It’s truly a hidden gem and worth the visit if you want a break from the hustle and bustle.
