      "text": "The Business\nof Great Food\nToday, our business maintains its successes as it continues to sustain a period of thriving profits and expansion. Each of the establishments is successfully operated and managed by a small staff consisting of about four to six persons. We have been able to stick to the owners’ wish to keep El Jalisco a business that is run primarily by close friends and family members. After all, a large percentage of our success as a restaurant is owed to the continued hard work and devotion that our family members and friends have provided over the years. The owners have always claimed that the hard work shown by the family, coupled with the will of God is the two largest contributing factors to the success of El Jalisco.\nThe Future of\nMexican Cuisine\nin America\nDespite the multitudes of success that we have been able to achieve as a company in the past, we are far from done in terms of expansion. We shall continue to carry on the same traditions of devotion towards this restaurant that the family expressed since day one. Through our continued hard work and dedication, we plan to create many more restaurants that are just as committed to maintaining the standard of excellence that we have labored to establish. As new El Jalisco restaurants open up across America, they continue to receive raving reviews from critics and customers alike. These allow us to reflect positively upon our accomplishments as an organization and enable us to proudly step forth as we step into the future.\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nStay up to date with El Jalisco and experience the taste of Mexico!\nSubscribe\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nStay up to date with El Jalisco and experience the taste of Mexico!\nSubscribe\n©2023 EL JALISCO.
