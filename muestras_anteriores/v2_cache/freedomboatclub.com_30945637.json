Our founding vision was clear: to provide a hassle-free boating experience for our members.\nIn a time when traditional boat ownership dominated the industry, our club model was revolutionary. With no boat clubs or extensive rental options available, we opened the waterways to the shared boat access revolution with premium dockside service and unparalleled training opportunities.\nIn May of 2019, Freedom Boat Club was acquired by Brunswick Corporation, joining the likes of Mercury Marine engines and boat brands including Bayliner Boats, Boston Whaler, Lund, and Sea Ray among several others – further solidifying our position as a market leader in the marine industry.\nWe’ve challenged the boating status quo for over 35 years. Today, we operate 400+ locations, offering 90,000+ members access to thousands of premium boats in waterways around the world.\nJoin Freedom Boat Club today and discover the joy of boating without the hassle.\nSUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES\nEmail\nCheck this box to ensure you receive all the latest and greatest information about Freedom Boat Club offers and promotions, including information from Freedom affiliates.  You can easily unsubscribe at any time.\nPlease fill out this field.\n* I agree: Check this box to acknowledge that your Personal Information will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy\nRequired\nThank you for your inquiry!\nWe will send you details about membership plans, promotions and local partnerships shortly.\nCAREERS\nOWN A FRANCHISE\nLEADERSHIP TEAM\nCONTACT US\nStay Connected\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nCookie Policy\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Rights\nModern Slavery Statement\n© 2025.
