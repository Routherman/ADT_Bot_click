However, it was his keen sense of opportunity and customer demand that propelled him to venture into a new realm: fireworks.\nIn the early 1970s, Bruce listened attentively to his customers' desires and recognized the untapped potential in the world of pyrotechnics. Responding to their requests, he began selling a line of sparklers, igniting the spark that would eventually evolve into the renowned Phantom Fireworks we know today.
