Flagler, one of America’s great industrialists, who started the trend of grand, gorgeous properties on the island. His first was The Royal Poinciana, a six-story Georgian beauty. Two years later, Flagler debuted his premier oceanfront hotel, which delighted guests with its proximity to the water and unique location—right at “the breakers,” where the waves crashed and sprayed.\nAfter fires in both 1903 and 1925, the hotel reemerged more opulent each time. The second reconstruction of The Breakers was awarded to New York City-based designers Shultze and Weaver, the same minds who would later create many of Manhattan’s most coveted hotels: the Pierre, the Sherry-Netherland and Park Avenue’s Waldorf Astoria. Described by the duo as “the acme of perfection in design and magnificence,” The Breakers reopened in 1926, ushering in a higher degree of European influence and architectural flair. Flagler’s newest iteration was modeled after the magnificent Villa Medici in Rome—an ambitious effort that called for 75 artisans brought in from Italy. Together they completed the intricate paintings, detailed across the ceilings of the 200-foot-long main lobby and first-floor public rooms, which remain on display today. It was a grand gesture that placed The Breakers in a class all its own.\nYear by year, the resort’s reputation grew and word spread, beckoning the glitterati to vacation in Palm Beach year-round. At any given time, the guest register read like a “who's who” of early 20th-century America: Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Astors, Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan, vacationing alongside US presidents and European nobility.\nToday, the story of The Breakers continues, holding fast to the ideals that put it on the map—unapologetic luxury, seaside glamour and world-class service—but also embracing the new. In our modern world that is more interconnected than ever before, we’re fully committed to our employees, our environment and the enduring mission of our organization.\nGreen initiatives\nAcross our resort grounds, we implement ecologically friendly practices that conserve resources and protect the environment, promising an enhanced quality of life for future generations. Our efforts epitomize The Breakers’ devotion to environmental stewardship while maintaining the distinctive quality and world-class service that guests expect of our resort. These green endeavors include energy efficiency, water conservation and waste reduction.\nThe Breakers is committed to expanding and enhancing all of our environmental programs to protect and preserve our precious natural resources.\nSocial impact\nAs a modern organization employing 2,400 people, our sense of social responsibility extends to our team, our environment and our community.

Flagler, one of America’s great industrialists, who started the trend of grand, gorgeous properties on the island. His first was The Royal Poinciana, a six-story Georgian beauty. Two years later, Flagler debuted his premier oceanfront hotel, which delighted guests with its proximity to the water and unique location—right at “the breakers,” where the waves crashed and sprayed.\nAfter fires in both 1903 and 1925, the hotel reemerged more opulent each time. The second reconstruction of The Breakers was awarded to New York City-based designers Shultze and Weaver, the same minds who would later create many of Manhattan’s most coveted hotels: the Pierre, the Sherry-Netherland and Park Avenue’s Waldorf Astoria. Described by the duo as “the acme of perfection in design and magnificence,” The Breakers reopened in 1926, ushering in a higher degree of European influence and architectural flair. Flagler’s newest iteration was modeled after the magnificent Villa Medici in Rome—an ambitious effort that called for 75 artisans brought in from Italy. Together they completed the intricate paintings, detailed across the ceilings of the 200-foot-long main lobby and first-floor public rooms, which remain on display today. It was a grand gesture that placed The Breakers in a class all its own.\nYear by year, the resort’s reputation grew and word spread, beckoning the glitterati to vacation in Palm Beach year-round. At any given time, the guest register read like a “who's who” of early 20th-century America: Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Astors, Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan, vacationing alongside US presidents and European nobility.\nToday, the story of The Breakers continues, holding fast to the ideals that put it on the map—unapologetic luxury, seaside glamour and world-class service—but also embracing the new. In our modern world that is more interconnected than ever before, we’re fully committed to our employees, our environment and the enduring mission of our organization.\nGreen initiatives\nAcross our resort grounds, we implement ecologically friendly practices that conserve resources and protect the environment, promising an enhanced quality of life for future generations. Our efforts epitomize The Breakers’ devotion to environmental stewardship while maintaining the distinctive quality and world-class service that guests expect of our resort. These green endeavors include energy efficiency, water conservation and waste reduction.\nThe Breakers is committed to expanding and enhancing all of our environmental programs to protect and preserve our precious natural resources.\nSocial impact\nAs a modern organization employing 2,400 people, our sense of social responsibility extends to our team, our environment and our community. From employee wellness and sustainable practices to community enrichment and powerful partnerships, our commitments not only ensure our enduring success, but also contribute to a sense of greater good.\nTo learn more about our perspective on corporate citizenship and the evolution of our culture of well-being, please explore our\nAnnual Report\n.\n<vimeo>\n</vimeo>\nView the\nvideo transcript\n|  Listen to the\naudio transcript\nPeek inside:\nResort Overview\nPhoto Gallery\nResort Amenities\nProperty Maps\nHistorical Timeline\nVideo:\nThe Living Legacy of The Breakers\nVideo:\nDown By The Breakers: A Palm Beach Story\nLearn More\nTo learn even more about what sets The Breakers apart,\nexplore our brochure.\n<div class=\"row global-promo\">\n\t\t<div class=\"col-im-offset-1 col-im-10 inline\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\nCheck Availability\nGive the Gift of Luxury: The Breakers Gift Card\nPURCHASE NOW\nAbout The Breakers\nContact Us\nLocation\nGuest Policies\nCareers\nPress Resource Center\nResidential Leases\nResort Accessibility\nPrivacy Policy\nCA Notice at Collection\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility\nSign Up for Special Offers\n<form class=\"form-inline\" action=\"/accommodation/footerstoreemail/\">\n\t<input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='r4uWeyt4gZu7HpK0pq3Rjb8xoNOXoT4oy9XCobr7vFLWLzHIGTTQdqLIgezjFc20' />\n\t<div class=\"form-group\">\n\t\t<input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Enter Your Email\">\n\t</div>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"rd\" value=\"/email-sign-up/\"/>\n\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\"><i class=\"ion-android-arrow-forward\"></i></button>\n</form>\nSign Up for Special Offers\n<form class=\"form-inline\" action=\"/accommodation/footerstoreemail/\">\n\t<input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='r4uWeyt4gZu7HpK0pq3Rjb8xoNOXoT4oy9XCobr7vFLWLzHIGTTQdqLIgezjFc20' />\n\t<div class=\"form-group\">\n\t\t<input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Enter Your Email\">\n\t</div>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"rd\" value=\"/email-sign-up/\"/>\n\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\"><i class=\"ion-android-arrow-forward\"></i></button>\n</form>\nCONNECT WITH US\nThe Breakers\nOne South County Road\nPalm Beach\n,\nFL\n33480\n© 2025 The Breakers Palm Beach, FL.\nAll rights reserved.\nModal\nClose\nEND Modal\nbower:js\nendbower\nBegin AZDS script for all pages\nBegin Response Tap/Infinity script - must be on all pages\nEnd Response Tap/Infinity Script",
