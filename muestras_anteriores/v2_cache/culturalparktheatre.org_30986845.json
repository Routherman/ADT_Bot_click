This year I did all 3 summer camp sessions, and I LOVED every second of it. All the counselors are so nice and everything they do is ✨ perfection ✨. The casting, the directing, the choreography, the sets, the props, everything is just amazing. In SpongeBob, I personally think the choreography was better than the actual Broadway show, in Willy Wonka, the oompa loompa choreography was stunning, and in Aladdin I was ensemble and it was SO FUN, the song \"Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim\" was so fun. The casting is so good. SpongeBob, Willy Wonka, and Aladdin were amazing, I played Patrick in SpongeBob, Grandpa Joe in Willy Wonka and Shop Owner in Aladdin. This was the first time I got a lead and I had so much fun. No matter what part anyone got they we're happy with it Another thing is that at the end of the day we get to play games and it's really fun. I wish I could never leave camp sometimes, all the people are so welcoming and so nice. I got into James and the Giant Peach so that gives me something to do during the school year, but I can't wait for camp to start again! If you ever have a chance I highly recommend coming to see one of the shows here, you'll have the time of your life seeing or being in the show.\nR-CONTENT\nKelsie Gregware\n2023-07-17\nR-CONTENT\nWow, just WOW! Our 8 year old daughter just finished one of the summer camp sessions here and we are just blown away! So is she! She attended the Willy Wonka Session of Theatre Camp, it was a two week session from 9am-4pm and at the end of it they put on the musical. As parents we were blown and I mean blown away by the what they all accomplished in just two weeks! We went to an after party for the kids and it wasn’t just us that were super impressed, all of the parents were just amazed! Our daughter was given a small role in the musical, perfect for her age and experience. Each day that I picked her up, she would be beaming and so pumped by the experience. She has had an interest in theatre since she was young but this just solidified it. The counselors were Highschool graduates who had grown up in the program and loved it, you could tell each day at drop off. There were kids of ALL ages there, our daughter was one of the youngest at 8 years old and kids went all the way to highschool age. Even with that vast age difference, they ALL were kind to each other and accepting. It was awesome for my daughter to see some mentors. She saw older kids helping younger kids and got to experience comradeship at its best. She was taught to practice and study, to get her role right. She had to audition for her role, which gave her insight on being brave, handling nervous energy and how to push through. Theatre camp teaches so many important life lessons, we are so thrilled we found this camp. It turns out that we discovered this camp has been going on for quite awhile, I ran into partner of kids in their 30’s who went to this camp as kiddos. So they obviously know what they are doing and how to be successful! Highly recommend, it will be the highlight to your kids summer as it was for our daughter. She’s begging for next year already!\nR-CONTENT\nHenry Coggins\n2023-06-05\nR-CONTENT\nMy wife and I saw Crimes of the Heart today at the 3pm show.  I am ashamed to say it was our first time here and I have lived on the Cape since 1973.  I can honestly say I have missed out on a lot by not coming to a play here.  This community theater is a wonderful place to spend a couple hours a see local performers.  There isn't a bad seat to view from.\nCrimes of the Heart is funny and is a play most of us can find common ground in.  As I was raised in the South, I saw similarities to some of my own relatives.  I thought the actors captured the zaniness and dysfunction so many families experience.\nDon't miss out on a fun afternoon.  Check out Crimes of The Heart. We will be coming to future plays!\nR-CONTENT\nGoogle\nrating score:\n4.4\nof 5,\nbased on\n71 reviews\nBrowse Our Shows\nEach season we put together a great showcase for you to enjoy!

      "text": "About Cultural Park Theatre Company\nCultural Park Theatre, located in Cape Coral, Florida, has a rich history deeply rooted in the local community.\n\nThe theater was founded in 1963 by Herb Strauss, who had a vision of providing a space where local residents could showcase their talents and enjoy live theater productions. Originally known as the “Cape Coral Players,” the theater began its journey in a small, rented storefront.\nOver the years, as Cape Coral grew and developed, so did the theater. In 1982, Cultural Park Theatre found its permanent home in the Cultural Park area of Cape Coral, where it resides to this day. This move marked a significant milestone for the theater, allowing it to expand its offerings and reach a wider audience.\nCultural Park Theatre quickly became a cornerstone of the local arts scene, offering a diverse range of productions, including plays, musicals, concerts, and educational programs. The theater has always been committed to nurturing talent within the community, providing opportunities for actors, directors, designers, and volunteers of all ages to participate in the performing arts.\nUnder the leadership of dedicated volunteers and staff, Cultural Park Theatre has continued to thrive and evolve. It has undergone renovations and upgrades to enhance the audience experience and maintain its status as a premier cultural institution in Southwest Florida.\nThroughout its history, Cultural Park Theatre has remained true to its mission of enriching the community through the arts. It has fostered a sense of belonging and camaraderie among patrons and performers alike, creating lasting memories and inspiring generations of theater lovers.\nToday, Cultural Park Theatre continues to uphold its legacy as a vibrant hub of creativity and entertainment. With a full calendar of productions and events year-round, it remains a beloved cultural landmark in Cape Coral and beyond, celebrating the power of live theater to educate, entertain, and unite.\nYour Donation Matters\nYou can help out by becoming a sponsor or an advertiser to our shows.\nDonate Today\nSign Up for a Special Offer!\nSign up and stay in touch with our newsletter today!\nSign Up for Our Newsletter",
