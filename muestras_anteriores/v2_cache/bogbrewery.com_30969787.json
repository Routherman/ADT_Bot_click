A limited amount of commemorative 1-liter steins will be available for purchase and discounted stein fills will be offered throughout the week. The kickoff celebration on Saturday, Sept. 22 will also include a German-themed BBQ.\nBog will release two beers for this weeklong event:\nOktoberfest beer: Brewed true to style using 100% German malts, including Munich and Amber malts, German hops and German yeast, this 5.2% amber lager has a pleasant, toasted aroma with a satisfying maltiness.\nBerliner Weisse: A low-alcohol, German-style sour beer that dates back to at least the 16th century. An abundance of wheat imparts breadiness and lactobacillus (a souring bacteria) adds a crisp tartness that makes this beer as refreshing as it is sessionable. Bogtoberfest attendees will have the option to include their choice of a traditional syrup.\nThe release of the Oktoberfest lager marks a special milestone for Head Brewer Steven Mendoza.\n“In terms of beer styles, our first love has always been European ales, lagers and sour beers,” says Mendoza. “As The Bog has grown, we’ve been able to incorporate these more into our tap lineup.
