      "text": "Main content starts here, tab to start navigating\nOur Story\nAt Clasico Italian Chophouse, we believe great food starts with great intention. We don’t just prepare meals—we create experiences, beginning with the ingredients we choose and the care we put into every dish. Our kitchen is fueled by a commitment to craftsmanship: pasta is rolled by hand daily, dough is tossed fresh to order, and every steak is hand-cut to exacting standards. This dedication to doing things the right way—not the easy way—reflects our belief that food made with heart simply tastes better.\nBut Clasico is more than just a restaurant—it’s a gathering place for our Sarasota community. Located in the heart of downtown, we’ve built our space to feel warm, vibrant, and full of life, just like the meals we serve. Whether it's your weekly family dinner, a special celebration, or a spontaneous night out with friends, we want every guest to feel welcomed, seen, and at home. We believe in the power of the shared table—where stories are told, laughter is loud, and food becomes a language of connection.\nOur menu reflects this spirit, blending the soulful flavors of classic Italian cooking with the bold indulgence of a modern chophouse. It’s a place where the familiar meets the unexpected—from wood-fired pizzas and house-made sauces to thoughtfully plated entrees designed to be passed, shared, and savored. We embrace the Italian philosophy of hospitality: generous portions, honest ingredients, and meals that bring people together.\nAt the core of everything we do is a love for our community and a passion for hospitality. We support local purveyors, celebrate local culture, and aim to be a place locals are proud to call their own. When you dine at Clasico, you’re not just a guest—you’re family. And we’re here to make sure every moment, every meal, and every memory feels truly special.\nMain Street Entertainment Group\nVision. Execution. Legacy.\nMain Street Entertainment Group is a hospitality company rooted in innovation, experience, and proven success. Founded and led by Kevin Enderle, a visionary with over 35 years in the restaurant and hospitality industry, with expertise spanning concept development, design, operations, and culinary execution, Main Street Entertainment Group doesn’t just open restaurants—we craft experiences. From neighborhood staples to elevated dining destinations, every venue is built with intention, authenticity, and the belief that great food and great service should always go hand in hand.\nClasico Italian Chophouse has served as our flagship concept for many years. Now, with a growing portfolio that includes Bosc Modern Bar + Kitchen and Parker Street Bakery, we’re expanding into the heart of South Tampa as we continue to shape the future of hospitality in Florida and beyond.\nOur Story\nAt Clasico Italian Chophouse, we believe great food starts with great intention.
