For me, this living, breathing substance is a leap into another world. Whether this ever-changing juice takes me to the vineyard in which it was grown, to the cellar where it’s held & shared by the winemaker, or to the last time & place you enjoyed it. Wherever it transports you, it livens your soul & has you craving more. That’s why it is so important to me to carry wines that are hyper-focused on a sense of place. In my opinion the most natural wine in the world is not wine with no human intervention, but wine that is produced from grapes grown exactly where they are indigenous to.
