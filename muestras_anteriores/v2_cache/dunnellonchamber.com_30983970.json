As the phosphate mining industry “boomed” and more people settled here, residents sought a more structured form of government. The town of Dunnellon, named for a local lawyer-turned-banker John F. Dunn, was incorporated in 1891 in the southwest corner of Marion County.\nRow Backgrounds\n2023 Board of Directors\nJudy Terwilliger\nExecutive Director\nWanda Nagovich\nTreasurer\nDave Fowler\nBoard Member\nJoanne Black\nPresident\nGeff Gascay\nBoard Member\nMichelle Wooten\nVice President\nEric Sokolsky\nBoard Member\nCindy Canter\nBoard Member\nDavid Rojas\nSecretary\nRuff Pennington\nBoard Member\nJulie Mancini\nBoard Member\n2023 Board of Directors\nJudy Terwilliger\nExecutive Director\nJoanne Black\nPresident\nMichelle Wooten\nVice President\nDavid Rojas\nSecretary\nWanda Nagovich\nTreasurer\nJoe Faino\nFinancial Manager\nEric Sokolsky\nBoard Member\nDave Fowler\nBoard Member\nGeff Gascay\nBoard Member\nRuff Pennington\nBoard Member\nJulie Mancini\nBoard Member\nCindy Canter\nBoard Member\nDunnellon’s Historic Train Depot\nDunnellon was platted as a railroad town in 1890. The train depot you see today was built along South Williams Street by the Atlantic Coast Line in 1908. Dunnellon became a hub for the railroad used to transport phosphate to processing plants in other parts of the state. The railroad’s emergence also led the local timber industry to thrive.\nTwo Atlantic Coast Line Railroad lines and one Seaboard Air Line Railroad used to pass through Dunnellon, carrying passengers, phosphate, timber, produce and cargo. Decades of stories exist of youngsters crowding the station to get a glimpse of what the trains were carrying. Today only one ACL line exists, used by the Florida Northern Railroad, carrying freight to the power plant in Red Level in Citrus County.\nThere are approximately 70 restored buildings in Dunnellon’s Boomtown Historic District today.\nVisit:\nhttp://www.dunnellondepot.com/\nfor more information.\nRow Backgrounds\nDunnellon Today\nDunnellon’s two rivers, the Rainbow and the Withlacoochee, and its extensive trail system provide the backbone for ecotourism, which brings tourists here to enjoy activities such as fishing, kayaking, tubing, diving, hiking, biking, horseback riding and bird watching. The historic downtown is host to opportunities for shopping for antiques and art, and eating out at many of the town’s quaint family owned restaurants.
