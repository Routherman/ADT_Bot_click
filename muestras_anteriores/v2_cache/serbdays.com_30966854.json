It is not accidental, it is deliberate, in words and deeds. The Clearwater Serb Fest is an opportunity to engage in a culture other than your own, and to enrich your worldview in a meaningful way.\nSerbian Festival in Clearwater is an annual festival organized by the Serbian community in the Tampa Bay area.  Our festival is a unique opportunity for the entire family to come out and have a fun, exciting, and totally different weekend.\nWhile here, you will have a chance to immerse yourself in the irreplaceable experience starting with Serbian world-famous cuisine, imported drinks, and skillful folklore dancers followed by old country tunes.\nNo doubt, after experiencing this, once-in-a-lifetime feast, you and your family will go home rejuvenated with full bellies, plenty of memories, and something to talk about until next time.\nIsn’t the Serb Fest just for Serbs?  Why everyone should attend\n:\nIt will be fun.  That’s the easiest and most obvious answer.  But we think there is more to it than that.  America is great because it welcomes people from all over the world.  There are few of us who can claim that we are native Americans.  Most of us are Italian Americans, German Americans, Irish Americans, and Serbian Americans.  What Americans will find when they come to our festival is that we are you.  We are now Americans who celebrate that and the culture, food, and language from where we came.  We want to share that with Americans.\nMost of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Serbia (Sumadija) You know, Serbians have a long tradition in the United States.  We are proud of this.  Most people don’t know this but one of the most important Serbian Americans helped design the AC electrical supply system.  His name was Nikola Tesla, a Serbian American who worked closely with Thomas Edison.\nPete Maravich, the basketball player was a Serbian whose parents came here to America when they were young.  Karl Malden the famous actor was Serbian and spoke only Serbian until kindergarten.  While he learned English (obviously), he spoke fluent Serbian until his death.  Trevor Matich played for the New England Patriots when they went to the Super Bowl in 1986.\nSerbians have played an important role in American history and our festival will celebrate that fact.  The two countries first established relations in 1882.  We are proud of our heritage and our culture and happy to be here in America with people of other backgrounds and cultures.  That is what makes America the country it is.\nOur Serb Fest in Clearwater is open to everyone.  We want everyone to feel welcome.  We look forward to sharing our food, our culture, and our fun.  Come join us!  You won’t be disappointed!\n727-888-3233\nContact@serbdays.com",
