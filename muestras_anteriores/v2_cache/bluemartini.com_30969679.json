It was a great experience from beginning to end!I have not been here in a few years and was very impressed with the upgrades made. The drinks and food were great and my team enjoyed the experience and attention to details.If you are in a need of a space for a company event, Cherish will make sure it is a flawless experience.\n- Janelle S. (MIA)\nThis is a great event venue! Cherish, the events manager, was amazing. She helped plan and host my business launch party. Planning the event was so easy and fun and the event went better than I could’ve hoped. Highly recommend booking your events here!\n- Salma M. (MIA)\nMy friends and I visited Blue Martini two weekends ago during my bachelorette weekend. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, we ended up staying the whole night. The environment and music were great too! Will definitely be coming back here anytime I’m in Miami. Thank you for the amazing hospitality - A soon to be bride and her Texas girls\n- Maria V. (MIA)\nWe randomly stumbled in here and had a great time. We had a party of 15 and were able to get drinks immediately. We didn’t think we would stay so we didn’t do bottle service, then we ended up staying 3 hours and did it anyway.  The DJ was killing it! He played every genre and a little something for everyone.\n- Angeli P. (MIA)\nBlue Martini Brickell was recently remodeled and just reopened not too long ago. This classy venue is on track to become a top night life destination in Miami with it's impressive world-class sound system and service for the elite and chic crowd.\n- 305 Luigi (MIA)\nPrevious\nNext\n/content-wrapper\nParty With Blue\nMartini\nWhat We Do\nHappy Hour\nLive Entertainment\nFood & Drink\nVenue / Private Events\nWhy Blue Martini?\nLive Entertainment\nFrom local talents to renowned artists, our carefully curated lineup ensures that every visit to Blue Martini is a musical journey.\nExceptional Service\nOur attentive and friendly staff is dedicated to ensuring your comfort and satisfaction throughout your Blue Martini experience.\nLively Atmosphere\nThe vibrant ambiance, pulsating beats, and the buzz of satisfied customers create an electrifying atmosphere, ensuring that your night is filled with energy and joy.\nPremium Martinis\nThe vibrant ambiance, pulsating beats, and the buzz of satisfied customers create an electrifying atmosphere, ensuring that your night is filled with energy and joy.\nAbout Us\nFounded with a passion for elevating nightlife, Blue Martini emerged as a vision to redefine the traditional bar experience.
