Pierce\nFt. Pierce\nAbout the Square Grouper Tiki Bar\nSquare Grouper in Jupiter Inlet, Florida, officially opened on Super Bowl Sunday, January 26, 2003. Since then it has become one of the most beloved and renowned Florida waterfront tiki bars in the United States.\nLocated at the end of Love Street, the Square Grouper Tiki Bar has incredible views of the Jupiter Inlet and its iconic lighthouse. Famous for its lively tropical atmosphere, it’s not just a place to enjoy refreshing drinks. Our bar is also a hub for exceptional live music and we host performances every day of the week.\nIn 2016, Square Grouper expanded its reach by opening the Square Grouper Tiki Bar at the Fort Pierce Inlet. Set above the riverwalk, this location quickly became a favorite spot for locals and visitors. Like its sister location, it’s known for its no-frills, fun environment to enjoy great food and drinks.\nSquare Grouper is dedicated to giving back to our South Florida communities. We regularly host fundraisers and to date the bar has raised over $750,000 for local charities.\nThe Square Grouper Tiki Bar is a 21-and-over venue that embraces a first-come, first-served system and no wait staff. Our patrons can enjoy the laid-back beach bar vibe without interruption.\nThe History of the Square Grouper Tiki Bar\nThe history of the Square Grouper Tiki Bar and Castaways Marina in Jupiter dates back to the late 19th century.\nIn the 1850s, as the notable Jupiter Lighthouse was being constructed, Gus Miller purchased land near the lighthouse and built a small hotel and saloon to accommodate the workers and travelers who passed through. The location sat along the original roadbed of the Celestial Railroad and offered spectacular views of the wild and scenic waterway that runs through the area. It quickly became a favorite stop for wealthy, fashionable tourists who would travel south along the Indian River by steamer or private yacht. Some would spend the night at the hotel near the Jupiter dock, while others stopped in at the saloon before continuing their journey.\nThe hotel and saloon were popular with travelers and dignitaries. President Grover Cleveland and other prominent figures dined and socialized there. The hotel’s dining room offered exquisite views of the inlet and often hosted dances and community celebrations, including a well-loved Christmas event. The saloon became a gathering place for conversation, entertainment, and camaraderie.\nIn the early 1900s, after the hotel was abandoned, the property changed ownership several times. Despite this, it remained a central meeting point for the community over the decades, hosting dances and social events. It continued to be a place where people came together to enjoy food, drink, and friendship, much like today.\nThe Jupiter Inlet itself has long been associated with adventurous and colorful history. Despite being classified as a non-navigable waterway by the U.S. Coast Guard, it has seen its fair share of travelers—both legitimate and illicit. In the 1600s, pirates frequented the inlet, and over the years, ships like the San Miguel de Archangel, laden with treasure, roamed these waters.\nIn more recent decades, the inlet became a hideout for contraband smugglers, including rum runners, bank robbers, and even drug smugglers who used the inlet as a drop point for illegal shipments. It’s this rich and often rebellious history that inspired the name “Square Grouper,” a term reportedly coined by the U.S. Coast Guard to describe bales of marijuana that were often discarded overboard or dropped from planes into the waterways near Jupiter.\nOn January 26, 2003, Square Grouper Tiki Bar officially opened in Jupiter. Over the years, it has become an iconic watering hole, recognized nationwide for its stunning setting. It also gained wider recognition as the location for Alan Jackson’s music video “It’s Five O’Clock Somewhere,” featuring Jimmy Buffett. The Tiki Bar quickly became a local landmark and destination for both tourists and locals seeking a taste of paradise.\nThe Square Grouper’s long history adds to its charm. Today, the Jupiter location continues to provide live music seven days a week, and the Tiki Bar remains a go-to spot for both relaxing and celebrating, much as it has for more than 130 years.\n©Sara Kauss Photography 2022\nVisit us\nSquare Grouper operates two beautiful waterfront locations.\nThe Square Grouper Tiki Bar at the Jupiter Inlet showcases picturesque views of the famous lighthouse and crystal-clear waters.
