The Witch Walk was a fundraiser for various animal charities, where women would dress in witch costumes and go on a pub crawl through the village streets during a weekend near Halloween. Women could define \"witch\" any way they wanted and Shelly and her friends decided to become the \"Decade Witches.\" After letting the other ladies chose their decade (50s, 60s, 80s, 90s), Shelly got the 70s Witch. As a lifelong fan of Disco and Halloween, it was the perfect fit. With excitement, Shelly claimed the title of \"The Disco Witch.\"\nFast forward to 2020 and Shelly and Jeff decide to retire. With nothing to do, Shelly learned how to brew beer. While brewing on the pool deck one day, Jeff wondered out loud why she wasn't \"wearing her witch hat and doing witchy things\" while she stirred the brew kettle. A quick run to the closet to retrieve her hat and the rest is history. Shelly began homebrewing under the name Disco Witch Brewing. When she finally decided to turn her hobby into a new career, the name stuck.\nInstagram\nReviews\nConnect With Us\nCopyright © 2025 Disco Witch Brewing - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by\nHome\nEvents",
