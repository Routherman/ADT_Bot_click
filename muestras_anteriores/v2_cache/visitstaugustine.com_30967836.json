      "text": "Historical Events\nHistory is the backbone of St. Augustine and is ever present in many of the local events. Living history takes visitors back in time to imagine what life was like in the colonial days of St. Augustine. Historic re-enactments take place often to re-create the significant events in St. Augustine’s past. Annual re-enactments like the Founder’s Day event in St. Augustine or the Spanish Colonial Grand Muster both commemorate notable events during the Spanish colonial period. It is the history in St. Augustine that ties each visitor and resident together and is common in all of us since St. Augustine’s successful port helped shape the country.\nSponsored Partners\nHistorical Events\nDate\nRegion\n- Any -\nAnastasia Island\nBartram & CR 210\nCrescent Beach\nElkton\nFruit Cove\nHastings\nHistoric Downtown\nLincolnville\nNorth City\nPonce de Leon Blvd\nPonte Vedra\nPonte Vedra Beach\nSR 16 to I-95\nSouth St. Augustine\nSt. Augustine Beach\nUptown\nUS1 North\nVilano Beach\nWest St. Augustine\nWorld Golf Area\nRegions\nListings\n30\n60\n90\n120\nSaturday, September 6th, 2025\nFort Mose Militia Muster & Training\nFirst Saturday of the month except July | 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.\n(904) 823-2232\nExperience authentic 18th-century weapons demonstrations.\nView Event\nFounder's Day 2025\nSaturday, Sep. 6, 2025 | 10:00 a.m. -

      "text": "5 Things to Know About Founder's Day\nThis holiday celebrates the entire story of St. Augustine's founding.\nShare This\nOn September 8, 1565, the city of St. Augustine was first founded, making it the oldest continually occupied settlement in the United States. St. Augustine is an important part of American history, and predates our country's oldest colonies, including Jamestown and Williamsburg. It was established by the Spanish and serves as the oldest, continually occupied European settlement in the continental United States.\nFounder's Day, or \"Founding Day,\" is the day that Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés landed in St. Augustine and claimed the new territory (named\nLa Florida\n) for the Spanish Crown. But how many locals and visitors know the full history of Founder's Day? Visitors and locals can celebrate St. Augustine's history by visiting for\nFounder's Day in September\neach year.\n1. Menéndez started his journey from prison.\nMany don't know this, but the story of St. Augustine's founding actually starts with Pedro Menéndez in prison. The soon-to-be founding governor had been arrested by the Casa de Contratacion, which governed trade in the Americas and disapproved of Menéndez's strict adherence to enforcing imperial law. Menéndez saw himself as above the Casa, and refused to partake in any of their backhand dealings. Starting in 1563, Menéndez was arrested and served 20 months in prison for a series of charges. He wrote to King Phillip II, confessing his innocence. King Phillip II allowed him to leave in order to lead the expedition to settle Florida.\n2. Menéndez found St. Augustine while searching for his son, Juan.\nIt was during his time in prison that Menéndez received news that his son, Juan, had shipwrecked near Bermuda in 1561. Although Menéndez showed great enthusiasm at the opportunity to bring Christianity to the Native Americans living in Florida—as well as obliterate the French presence at Fort Caroline—it was the search for his son that initiated his call for release. Menéndez was never able to find his son.\nA historic black and white block-print of a ship sailing through stormy seas.\n3. St. Augustine was named after the feast day of the saint.\nThe city is named St. Augustine because land was sighted on the feast day of St. Augustine of Hippo on August 28. A feast day is a day of dedication to a saint according to the Christian calendar of saints, usually on the presumed date of their death. St. Augustine of Hippo was a convert to the Christian faith and early theologian. He originally studied rhetoric and sought to be an orator in Rome, but became disillusioned with a life of excess. His book,\nConfessions\n, is considered the first autobiography of the Western World, and scenes from his life can be seen depicted in the windows of the\nCathedral Basilica of St. Augustine\n.\nTwo colorful stained glass depictions of scenes from the life of Saint Augustine of Hippo.\n4. When Menéndez landed, he celebrated mass with his crew.\nHow do you thank God when you survive a dangerous expedition across a large body of water, with the possibility of hurricanes, scurvy, and pirates? You offer a mass and thank God for your life, and for the lives of your crew. It's one of the first things Menéndez's crew did when they arrived, and it made St. Augustine an important site in the history of Catholicism in America. Pilgrims continue to visit St. Augustine and the Mission Nombre de Dios to this day to explore the site where Christianity came to America.\nThe Mission Nombre de Dios\nhas a cathedral, museum, worship center, and walking trails on their property for those looking to learn about, and experience, the religious past of St. Augustine's history.\n5.

The landing is put on by Florida Living History, whose members dress in traditional Spanish military garb and arrive at the grounds of the Mission Nombre de Dios on a landing boat.
