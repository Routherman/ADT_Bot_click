It was there that Jessie developed a passion for craft beer and the craft beer community. In her free time, she studied the history of beer, the science behind it, the different regions and varieties of it – simply put, she was obsessed. She finished her degree and immediately enrolled in the American Craft Brewers apprenticeship, where she interned at Harpoon Brewing Company in Vermont.\nOne night, while enjoying beers around a wood stove on a snowy December evening, Kevin and Jessie decided they wanted something of their own. Since then, Jessie graduated from the American Brewer’s Guild, worked at renown breweries up and down the east coast, completed the Advanced Theory in Brewing Science through Siebel University, and is currently enrolled in Auburn University’s Master’s Program in Brewing Science working towards her level 3 Ciceron certification. Kevin moved to Fernandina after graduating from UMaine’s School of Business. He took a job as a groundskeeper for a new tennis club in Nassau County, where his talents and knowledge were instantly recognized by ownership. Kevin was quickly promoted to Marketing Director where he began to manage day to day operations of the club.\nAt the age of 27, he was promoted for a second time to General Manager. This proved to be a great fit for Kevin, as he continued to build relationships within the club and community as a whole. Gregarious in nature, Kevin is constantly working with members on and off the court. When he’s not at the club, you can catch him running, skateboarding, or enjoying the beach. When asked what he enjoys most, Kevin simply stated: “Spending time with my best friend and the love of my life, Jessie”. “\nWe’ve worked hard over the past decade to gain experience in our respective fields and help make this dream a reality. First Love is about pursuing one’s dreams and passions in life. We are driven by the friends we meet, the places we visit, and community that we love. We are thrilled to share our dream with you.” Thank You, Kevin and Jessie\n“A man who lies about beer makes enemies.” – Stephen King\n“A meal of bread, cheese, and beer constitutes the perfect food.” — Queen Elizabeth I\n“Milk is for babies. When you grow up, you have to drink beer.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger\n“Ah, beer.
