Wetlands acquired with Duck Stamp dollars help purify water, aid in flood control, reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, and enhance outdoor recreation opportunities.\nOne Stamp, Many Uses\nWhile waterfowl hunters 16 years of age or older are required to purchase them, anyone can contribute to conservation by buying Duck Stamps. In addition to serving as hunting license and conservation tool, a current Federal Duck Stamp is also a free pass into any\nnational wildlife refuge\nnational wildlife refuge\nA national wildlife refuge is typically a contiguous area of land and water managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  for the conservation and, where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife and plant resources and their habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.\nLearn more about national wildlife refuge\nthat charges an entry fee. Because nearly all of the proceeds are used to conserve habitat for birds and other wildlife, birders, nature photographers and other outdoor enthusiasts buy Duck Stamps to help ensure that they can always see wildlife at their favorite outdoor spots.\nFederal Duck Stamps are\nsold\nat many sporting goods stores and other retail locations - both large and small - that sell sporting and recreation equipment. You can also buy them at many\nnational wildlife refuges\n, and online through\nAmplex\n. As an added convenience, especially for hunters, you can purchase an E-Duck Stamp online.

A physical Federal Duck Stamp will be mailed to each E-Duck Stamp purchaser between March 10 – June 30.\nIf you would like to sell\nFederal Duck Stamps\nand\nJunior Duck Stamps\nat your location, please visit our\nSell Duck Stamp\npage.\nA Unique and Collectible Work of Art\nAlso known as the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp, the Duck Stamp was\nconceived in 1934\n, when Congress passed and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the\nMigratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act\n(later amended to the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Act). The\nfirst Duck Stamp\nwas designed by J.N. \"Ding\" Darling, then director of the Bureau of Biological Survey (forerunner to today's\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service\n).\nIn addition to being the only conservation revenue stamp, the Federal Duck Stamp is also unique in the way the stamp is created. Each year, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service holds an\nart contest\n, the only juried art competition sponsored by the federal government. Any artist 18 years or older may enter, and the winning artist sees his or her work featured as the\ndesign\non the following year's Federal Duck Stamp.\nThe\nFederal Duck Stamp Art Contest\nis open to the public; anyone can witness a bit of history in the making as judges select the winning art from among hundreds of entries.\nIf you can't make it to the contest, you can still see original Duck Stamp entries; the top entries each year\ntour the nation\n, exhibited at museums, refuges, festivals and other venues.\nFederal Duck Stamps are miniature works of art, and they are prized by stamp collectors around the world. The stamp image is featured on products such as t-shirts, calendars, mugs and blankets, through the\nDuck Stamp Licensing Program\n.\nMany states issue their own duck stamps. In some states, the stamps are purely a collector's item, but in others, the stamps have a similar role in hunting and conservation as Federal Duck Stamps. Some states hold contests to choose the art for their stamps.\nJunior Duck Stamp: Conservation Through the Arts\nThe\nJunior Duck Stamp Program\nis the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's premier\nconservation education\ninitiative.

The 42,657-acre refuge ranges in elevation from 1,800 to 5,600 feet, supporting a wide variety of habitats --forests, rolling hills, open meadows, lakes, rivers and marshes. This mix of habitat types supports a wide variety of plants and animals, as well as healthy watersheds, clear streams, and clean water. Historically, the resources protected by the refuge have been important to local economies and helped drive growth in the region.\nImage Details\nCatastrophic wildfires are increasing and at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge, foresters and biologists are restoring more wildfire resilient forests.\nThe only mountainous mixed-conifer forest refuge in the lower 48, Little Pend Oreille encompasses six distinct forest zones and features species such as Douglas fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, western white pine, western red cedar, western hemlock, and subalpine fir. Fire has been an important part of the natural cycles in these refuge forests, but today they are burning hotter and faster than ever before. Invasive species like white pine blister rust and changes in forest management policy have contributed to the rise in these catastrophic wildfires. In some places, forest stands are too dense; and in others they need restoration through tree planting. The refuge uses weed management, tree and vegetation planting, and other science-based management tools to achieve conservation goals for forests and restore a more fire resilient ecosystem.\nImage Details\nUn-treated and treated with commercial thinning forest stands at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe buildup of ladder fuels–forest litter, brush and younger trees–causes wildfires to burn hotter, longer and faster. The more difficult and dangerous to combat fires can reach more mature trees and treetops and kills more trees. Prescribed fires can be used to mimic natural fires that once cleared old vegetation from the land helping native plants regenerate and local wildlife to thrive. Using carefully planned prescribed fire, the refuge can reduce ladder fuels to create more defensible forests. Restoring regular, smaller fires to the ecosystem helps make the forests less susceptible to catastrophic wildfire.\nImage Details\nPrescribed fires are an essential treatment used to reduce ladder fuels at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nCommercial and non-commercial tree thinning can also reduce the amount of ladder fuels in some tree stands. Selectively targeting certain trees can reduce competition for sunlight and water and remove fuel that contributes to out-of-control wildfire. After thinning, leftover vegetation is gathered into piles and, after a year or more, burned by refuge fire personnel.\nImage Details\nHealthy forests protect watersheds and wildlife, ensuring future generations of Americans can enjoy our natural heritage.\nStrategic planning takes place each year to determine which treatment is appropriate for different tree stands. When commercial thinning is the best treatment for an area, the refuge will put that job out for bid in the local community. This win-win approach benefits taxpayers, contributes to America’s economy and supports the refuge’s conservation mission.\nImage Details\nWildlife depend on the healthy forests and clean water protected and maintained by Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nEach refuge is established for a special purpose and Little Pend Oreille was established to protect the places native wildlife and migratory birds need to rest and raise their young. Thousands of visitors enjoy the refuge each year—camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, and experiencing all its forests and habitats have to offer. Refuges like Little Pend Oreille generate billions of dollars in economic output and wages, as well as local, county, and state tax revenue, key contributions to the trillion-dollar outdoor recreation industry. The innovative, active management of the refuge protects the Northwest's historic landscapes, ensuring future generations can enjoy and benefit from America’s natural heritage.\nImage Details\nA family enjoys boating at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nStory Tags\nEconomics\nFire management\nForests\nHarvest\nNatural infrastructure\nNatural resource conservation\nPrescribed burning\nResource management\nVisitor services\nVisitors\nWildlife refuges\nRecreational Activities\nAccessible trails\nAuto tour\nBirding\nCamping\nEducation programs\nFishing\nHiking\nHunting\nWildlife watching\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nWorking Lands\nFacilities\nKootenai National Wildlife Refuge\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge\nTurnbull National Wildlife Refuge\nLatest Stories\nCurrent Road Status at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge\nSep 2, 2025\nMigratory Species\nMigratory Bird Annual Status Reports\nSep 2, 2025\nA Victory Against Invasive Species\nSep 2, 2025\nPagination\nPrevious page\nCurrent page\n1\nPage\n2\nPage\n3\nPage\n4\nPage\n5\nPage\n6\nPage\n7\nPage\n8\nPage\n9\nNext page\nProtecting the Forests that Helped Build America\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nImage Details\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge is protecting the special places in the Northwest that defined the region and supported economic growth.\nNear Colville, in the northeast corner of Washington state, Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge restores and protects the forests that helped build America.

King Spring, one of seven federal manatee sanctuaries set up from November to March, provides critical habitat for the over 600 manatees that migrate to Kings Bay each winter. In addition to the establishment of Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, manatees are also protected by the 2012 designation of the entire Kings Bay area as the Kings Bay Manatee Refuge (or Kings Bay Manatee Protection Area). Buzzard, Parker, and Banana islands provide habitat for bald eagles, osprey, wood storks, and many other shore birds.\nOur Mission\nCrystal River National Wildlife Refuge will strive to preserve, restore, and enhance the exceptional diversity of native flora and fauna of Kings Bay and the Three Sisters Springs for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.\nCrystal River National Wildlife Refuge habitat management goals will seek to maintain a healthy refuge environment that will provide opportunities for visitors to enjoy wildlife-dependent uses in a natural setting.

At that time, the Three Sisters Springs group discharged to Kings Bay through a long (more than 3,200 feet), non-navigable, heavily wooded, shallow, braided and poorly defined spring run (creek).\nImage Details\nA local dive shop offered tours into Three Sisters Springs on glass bottom sightseeing boats in the 1950’s.\nA canal was constructed in the 1960’s to allow for navigable access to Three Sisters Springs.\nSewer Sam, the first documented, rescued Florida manatee, was rehabilitated at Three Sisters Springs in 1972 by Jacques Cousteau. The story of Sewer Sam can be seen in the documentary,\nThe Forgotten Mermaid\n.\nPilings were placed at the entrance to Three Sisters Springs in 1982 to limit vessel traffic; the spring run was also lined with large boulders.\nThree Sisters Springs was a naturally a forested wetland. In the 1970s, most trees were removed, and an 8-acre pit (originally named Lake Linda and now named lake Crystal) was dug. It collapsed into the aquifer at approximately 40 feet deep. The excavated material was used to provide fill for the entire property.\nThe Three Sisters Springs property was to be developed with condos and townhouses, and water was to be commercially extracted and bottled from the springs.\nIn 2008, The Friends of Crystal River NWR Complex began efforts to save Three Sisters Springs from development. Following a successful partnership consisting of state, federal and local organizations, the Three Sisters Springs property was purchased for 10.5 million: approximately two million less than fair market value.\nThree Sisters Springs is now jointly owned by the city of Crystal River and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD).\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), under a lease agreement with the City of Crystal River, manages Three Sisters Springs as part of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge.\nThree Sisters Springs opened to the public in November 2014 after improvements to  the gate and existing limestone road were made.\nThe SWFWMD restored some of the original wetlands to filter runoff from US 19. This project began in the fall of 2014 and was finished by 2015.\nThe following have already taken place at Three Sisters Springs since the acquisition in 2010:\nBoulder removal along spring run, to provide for manatee access during low tides\nConstruction of boardwalk\nConstruction of a pavilion\nExotic vegetation removal\nImprovement of unpaved access road\nPlacement of two temporary parking lot\nPlanting of native trees around the springs\nPlacement of regulation signs\nPublic Use Surveys\nConceptual plan design for facilities\nOpen House events including National Wildlife Refuge Day celebration, Manatee Fest and other events hosted by the Friends of Crystal River NWR\nErosion stabilization at TSS\nConstruction of bathrooms and other facilities\nBank stabilization project of the canal in front of the Three Sisters Springs Complex\nThe following future facilities and projects are planned and awaiting funding:\nBuilding of viewing platforms over Magnolia Springs at the north side of the property\nCreating a pollinator garden to support native species\nBuilding an ADA compliant fishing pier at Lake Crystal\nWorking with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.",

There are several ways to enjoy the refuge. You can explore the displays at the visitor’s center located on Kings Bay, where volunteer staff will answer questions. You can visit the Three Sisters Springs property to walk the boardwalk, view the springs, or enjoy the trails. To swim or paddle in the Three Sisters Springs, you can rent a vessel/paddle craft nearby or bring your own and launch at a boat ramp on Kings Bay. Visitors can even put on a wetsuit and snorkel to immerse themselves in the underwater world of the manatee.\nImage Details\nExplore our Visitor Center and Nature Store to learn about manatees and their habitat.\nCrystal River National Wildlife Refuge Complex Headquarters\n1502 SE Kings Bay Drive\nCrystal River, FL 34429-4661\nVisitor Center and Nature Store hours 9:00 to 4:00 daily from November 15-March 31 and 10:00 to 4:00 M-F from April 1-November 14.\nPrograms are offered frequently at Three Sisters Springs.

The Three Sisters Springs property provides land access via shuttle service, but no access to the water is provided at this site. The refuge doesn’t offer any water-access facilities. However, there are several City boat ramps and private ramps (with a fee) that provide access to refuge waters. If you are interested in visiting other parts of the refuge (other than Three Sisters Springs boardwalk), you can use your own vessel, rent a vessel, or book a guided tour. The refuge does not provide guided manatee tours itself, but instead has allotted Special Use Permits to many businesses in Kings Bay to provide them.\nClick here for a current list of refuge permitted tour operators\nwho offer several different types of rentals and guided tours. However you choose to meet a manatee, remember to keep calm and enjoy the moment! It’s a privilege and responsibility to make sure we treat this beloved threatened species with the utmost care and respect.\nThe manatee season at Crystal River NWR begins November 15 and ends March 31. This is when the seven warm water manatee sanctuaries are in effect. During the winter months, manatees come to the springs of Crystal River NWR to conserve the energy necessary to survive the cold Gulf waters. Remember when you are visiting Crystal River, you are visiting the manatees home. The Manatee Manners videos are designed to provide visitors with the necessary awareness that prevents disturbing manatees while engaging in different recreational activities.
