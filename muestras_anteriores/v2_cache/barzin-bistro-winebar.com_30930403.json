The main table and rug in the first room was from the dining room in my own house. Our focus was upscale but friendly customer service and consistently high-quality food; served in a comfortable, casual, and fun environment.\nI believe after more than 10 years in business, I may have lost sight of my original concept and the goals I had for Bar Zin. Before I knew it, we expanded once, then another time a few years later, bringing us from 49 seats to over 160安e expanded into off-site catering, and added a liquor license to stay competitive.\nOur reopening this coming May 2021 will take us back to my original vision I had 10 years ago. We are going back to the basics; creating an extensive wine list to live up to the name as a wine bar and bringing back the upscale but comfort food you loved back then, in a tapas style menu.\nEventually, we will move Holly over from Amelia Island Company into our library room, which will allow our guests to shop and dine in the convenience of one location. Thank you for not only supporting Bar Zin, Cucina South and Amelia island wine Company, but for supporting me and my dream. Looking forward to another 10 years with all of you.\nTim Seyda\nAbout\nFROM THE OWNER\nMy original concept was a quaint neighborhood wine bar and bistro tucked behind the trees of palmetto walk.
