The family business atmosphere\nhas a charm hard to find in other, commercially driven, travel sectors.\nAn industry dominated by small businesses causes a unique technology problem, though. With less\nproperties owned by corporations, there's less widely dispersed booking technology.\nThat's why there isn't an Expedia for campgrounds and RV parks. RoverPass is here to solve this problem\nwith easy-to-use, awesome software for campgrounds along with travel agents to help RVers.",
