Whether you love shopping, culture, art, food, history or relaxation, Sarasota has it all. Everything from the renowned Ringling Museum to St. Armand’s Circle, where you’ll find delicious food and great local shops nestled along the water.

Small, quiet, friendly and the best management you could ever ask for. Super location!\n\"\n– Peggy K.\n\"\nNice quiet little spot (mobile home / RV park)  this location is in a great location in south Sarasota. You are a hop skip away from the beach. You are next to the mall and other things to do.\n\"\n– Chris D.\n\"\nIt's very quiet and well kept. This place has the best sunset views around. The only better views would be on the actual beach itself. I love that this place is right on the edge of town so it's very peaceful even though it is right next to US41. They offer free wifi to all residents and they have a really nice clubhouse and pool. There is also an on site laundry mat which is great because everything you need is right in the park and all of the stores are in close walking distance.\n\"\n– Crystal P.\n\"\nIt is very calm and pleasant. An area close to everything, especially the beautiful beaches with their crystal clear waters!
