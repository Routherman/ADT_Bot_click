      "text": "Pathway To Membership\nThank you for your interest in the Florida SKP Resort, a 55+ community. We recommend that anyone looking for membership in our or community plan a visit with us.\nThis resort was built by the members and has been maintained by its members and visitors, ever since.  We want you to experience the vibrant community we are today so you can make an informed decision about becoming members.\nNew members and repeat visits from those on the wait list bring fresh perspectives, new ideas and energy to the park! We are very proud of our park and facilities. Even though we are called a “resort,” we are really a membership park where we all work together to maintain and run “our” park. We would like you to think of this park as your home and help take care of it as you would your own property.\nCome visit; talk with members and visitors.  Participate in the life of our community and get a feel for our park. Feel the warmth of the sunshine on your back and cool off at our beautiful outdoor pool.\nAs in any other place, life is what you make it. We believe that our lives are enriched and healthier by living here because the occasions for social interaction are limitless. There is always something going on including a variety of special interest activities, breakfasts, social hours, movie nights, cards and games, informal get-togethers, dinners, sightseeing, as well as shows and shopping in surrounding communities to name just a few.\nThe members of the park are active citizens of the community with many volunteering at the local hospital, churches, and non-profit organizations, i.e. participating in the county’s annual Christmas parade, volunteering as bell ringers for the Salvation Army, and donating blood. Studies show that people who volunteer and participate in social events 1 to 2 hours a week are healthier, live longer, and are more satisfied with their lives.\nIf you like what you see here, you will be ready to begin the pathway to membership that is outlined on “\nInterested in Membership?\n” page.\nWhat can you expect from your life at the FL SKP Resort?\nAn active volunteer base is necessary for our park to be successful. Our park was built by and is maintained by volunteers. As a member, your involvement is expected. Committees are the main support system of our governing body and members are always needed to serve on these committees. Any talent or skill can be used and will help fill a need in the park.
