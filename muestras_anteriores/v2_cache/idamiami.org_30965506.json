Since then, his work hinges the analog with the digital, understanding our reality as a real virtuality.\nEmphasizing the economic and social aspects of the internet, his paintings and videos portray people who live from their online activity, virtual reality landscapes, cell phone photographs,computer-generated images, and leaked files. Understanding that the accumulation of information in the digital age is the greatest source of wealth, Cedillo portrays information displayed on screens, sculpts using computer-processed information, and uses the programming itself to make way for an awareness of how the internet shapes our daily life. Since 2012, he has focused on art theory and research. His work has been presented at the\nRita Vie\nRita Vie is a multimedia artist, currently working between venice and the internet.
