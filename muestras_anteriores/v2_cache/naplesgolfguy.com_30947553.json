      "text": "Equity Golf Communities\nBack to Golf Communities\nThe majority of Equity Golf Communities have converted to a non-equity membership model and now require an up-front “Initiation Fee” for your golf membership.\nAlso, you will be required to pay annual membership dues which vary significantly between clubs. The amount of equity (if any) also varies by club. Many private golf clubs in Southwest Florida used to include equity in the golf club. However, most clubs have shifted to a model with an up-front non-refundable initiation fee with no equity stake in the golf club. If needed, some clubs may offer payment terms for the initiation fee.\nIn general, private golf club memberships include the social benefits of the community in addition to full golf privileges. In certain instances, there are alternative membership options such as a\n“Social” or “Sports” membership\n. These alternative memberships include access to social activities and amenities of the club throughout the entire year. Additionally, some social or sports memberships allow golf privileges during the summer months (May 1st through October 31st).\nNaples\nAudubon Country Club\nBay Colony Golf Club\nBears Paw Country Club\nBonita Bay Club East\nColliers Reserve Country Club\nCountry Club of Naples\nEagle Creek\nFiddler’s Creek\nGolf Club of the Everglades\nGrey Oaks Country Club\nHammock Bay\nHideout Golf Club\nHole in the Wall Golf Club\nImperial Golf Estates\nKensington Golf & Country Club\nLakewood Country Club\nLaPlaya Golf Club\nLely Resort\nMoorings Golf and Country Club\nNaples Grande Golf Club\nNaples National Golf Club\nOld Collier Golf Club\nOlde Cypress\nOlde Florida Golf Club\nPelican Bay\nPelican Marsh Golf Club\nQuail Creek Country Club\nQuail Run Golf Club\nQuail Village Golf Club\nRookery Golf Club\nRoyal Palm Golf Club\nRoyal Poinciana Golf Club\nTalis Park\nThe Club at the Strand\nThe Quarry\nTiburón Golf Club\nTwin Eagles\nVineyards Country Club\nWilderness Country Club\nWindstar Golf Club\nWyndemere Country Club\nBonita Springs/Estero\nBonita Bay Club West\nColony Golf & Country Club\nEstero Country Club\nGrandezza Country Club\nHunters Ridge Country Club\nMediterra Golf Club\nMiromar Lakes Golf Club\nPalmira Golf Club\nQuail West\nSaltleaf Golf Preserve\nShadow Wood Country Club\nThe Nest at Pelican Landing\nWest Bay Club\nWildcat Run\nFort Myers\nCrown Colony Golf and Country Club\nCypress Lake Golf Club\nFiddlesticks Country Club\nForest Country Club\nGulf Harbour Yacht and Country Club\nPelican Preserve\nPlantation Golf Club\nSanctuary Golf Club\nShadow Wood Preserve\nThe Club at Gateway\nThe Club at Renaissance\nVerandah Golf Club\nWhiskey Creek Country Club\nLakewood Ranch/Bradenton\nLakewood Ranch\nRiver Strand Golf Club\nSarasota\nConcession Golf Club\nFounders Golf Club\nLaurel Oak Country Club\nLongboat Key Club\nMeadows Country Club\nMiakka Golf Club\nMisty Creek Country Club\nPalm Aire Country Club\nThe Oaks Club\nTPC Prestancia\nVenice\nBoca Royale Golf and Country Club\nCapri Isles Golf Club\nJacaranda West Country Club\nMyakka Pines Golf Club\nPlantation Golf Club\nVenetian Golf and River Club\nVenice Golf and Country Club\nWaterford Golf Club\nNeed some Assistance\nSo if you are considering buying your dream home in a private golf club in Naples, Bonita Springs, Estero, Fort Myers, Venice, Bradenton, Sarasota or Lakewood Ranch contact us for additional information about the clubs.\nWith more than 200 golf communities to navigate, it can be challenging to identify which one will be a good fit for you and your family.
