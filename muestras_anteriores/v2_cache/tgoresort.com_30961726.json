Our RV lifestyle choices range from sites to custom-built homes, all designed with RVers in mind. Our motto has always been “Stay a Night or a Lifetime!”\nWe began with an idea to create a naturally beautiful, truly unique RV resort – a quiet 2,800-acre community of towering pines, swaying palms, picturesque lakes and a gorgeous golf course, perfect for any vacation. We planned carefully to offer serenity and privacy, yet also feature a fine restaurant, café dining and superb sporting facilities on site. And we did it!\nOur first priority is, and always will be, to preserve the natural surroundings of this remarkable resort. That’s why each site is carefully planned to leave as much nature as possible. It was also our intent for the majority of our sites to back up to our golf course, a lake or nature so that you would have neighbors side to side, but no one behind you.\nWe enhanced nature with man-made pleasures so you could experience the scenic beauty of our par-72, 18-hole championship golf course winding through woodlands…. or try your luck with rod and reel against the largemouth bass carefully stocked in our lakes and ponds. We are catch and release only – no live bait allowed!  Fishing hours are from sunrise to sunset.\nOur four-legged friends are welcome at The Great Outdoors. We even have “Doggie World”, a fenced area where they can run and play while their owners get acquainted.\nAs an overnight vacationer, you’ll appreciate our paved streets, wide turnarounds and angled sites. For your pleasure and convenience, all full-hookup sites include level, concrete pads, 30/50 amp electric, water and sewer.\nAt The Great Outdoors, you can have the best of both worlds – the easy-going RV lifestyle or a beautiful site-built home of your own, with RV parking right on your own lot. If you decide you want to join our resort on a more permanent basis, or if you are looking to investing for your future, you will be glad to know that your site is deeded to you with a fee simple title – you own your land!\nCall to Reserve\n800-621-2267\nThe Great Outdoors is\nAmerica’s highest-rated RV resort!\nSince our inception, we have earned the exclusive Good Sam 10-10-10 rating.
