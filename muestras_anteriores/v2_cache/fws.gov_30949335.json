The 42,657-acre refuge ranges in elevation from 1,800 to 5,600 feet, supporting a wide variety of habitats --forests, rolling hills, open meadows, lakes, rivers and marshes. This mix of habitat types supports a wide variety of plants and animals, as well as healthy watersheds, clear streams, and clean water. Historically, the resources protected by the refuge have been important to local economies and helped drive growth in the region.\nImage Details\nCatastrophic wildfires are increasing and at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge, foresters and biologists are restoring more wildfire resilient forests.\nThe only mountainous mixed-conifer forest refuge in the lower 48, Little Pend Oreille encompasses six distinct forest zones and features species such as Douglas fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, western white pine, western red cedar, western hemlock, and subalpine fir. Fire has been an important part of the natural cycles in these refuge forests, but today they are burning hotter and faster than ever before. Invasive species like white pine blister rust and changes in forest management policy have contributed to the rise in these catastrophic wildfires. In some places, forest stands are too dense; and in others they need restoration through tree planting. The refuge uses weed management, tree and vegetation planting, and other science-based management tools to achieve conservation goals for forests and restore a more fire resilient ecosystem.\nImage Details\nUn-treated and treated with commercial thinning forest stands at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe buildup of ladder fuels–forest litter, brush and younger trees–causes wildfires to burn hotter, longer and faster. The more difficult and dangerous to combat fires can reach more mature trees and treetops and kills more trees. Prescribed fires can be used to mimic natural fires that once cleared old vegetation from the land helping native plants regenerate and local wildlife to thrive. Using carefully planned prescribed fire, the refuge can reduce ladder fuels to create more defensible forests. Restoring regular, smaller fires to the ecosystem helps make the forests less susceptible to catastrophic wildfire.\nImage Details\nPrescribed fires are an essential treatment used to reduce ladder fuels at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nCommercial and non-commercial tree thinning can also reduce the amount of ladder fuels in some tree stands. Selectively targeting certain trees can reduce competition for sunlight and water and remove fuel that contributes to out-of-control wildfire. After thinning, leftover vegetation is gathered into piles and, after a year or more, burned by refuge fire personnel.\nImage Details\nHealthy forests protect watersheds and wildlife, ensuring future generations of Americans can enjoy our natural heritage.\nStrategic planning takes place each year to determine which treatment is appropriate for different tree stands. When commercial thinning is the best treatment for an area, the refuge will put that job out for bid in the local community. This win-win approach benefits taxpayers, contributes to America’s economy and supports the refuge’s conservation mission.\nImage Details\nWildlife depend on the healthy forests and clean water protected and maintained by Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nEach refuge is established for a special purpose and Little Pend Oreille was established to protect the places native wildlife and migratory birds need to rest and raise their young. Thousands of visitors enjoy the refuge each year—camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, and experiencing all its forests and habitats have to offer. Refuges like Little Pend Oreille generate billions of dollars in economic output and wages, as well as local, county, and state tax revenue, key contributions to the trillion-dollar outdoor recreation industry. The innovative, active management of the refuge protects the Northwest's historic landscapes, ensuring future generations can enjoy and benefit from America’s natural heritage.\nImage Details\nA family enjoys boating at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nStory Tags\nEconomics\nFire management\nForests\nHarvest\nNatural infrastructure\nNatural resource conservation\nPrescribed burning\nResource management\nVisitor services\nVisitors\nWildlife refuges\nRecreational Activities\nAccessible trails\nAuto tour\nBirding\nCamping\nEducation programs\nFishing\nHiking\nHunting\nWildlife watching\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nWorking Lands\nFacilities\nKootenai National Wildlife Refuge\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge\nTurnbull National Wildlife Refuge\nLatest Stories\nCurrent Road Status at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge\nSep 2, 2025\nGet Involved\nPublic Target Shooting Facilities Reopen in Alaska and Maine Following Modernization Upgrades\nAug 28, 2025\nRecreation\nThrough the Lens, Nature Pictured at the Hatchery\nAug 27, 2025\nPagination\nPrevious page\nCurrent page\n1\nPage\n2\nPage\n3\nPage\n4\nPage\n5\nPage\n6\nPage\n7\nPage\n8\nPage\n9\nNext page\nProtecting the Forests that Helped Build America\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nImage Details\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge is protecting the special places in the Northwest that defined the region and supported economic growth.\nNear Colville, in the northeast corner of Washington state, Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge restores and protects the forests that helped build America.

Historically, the resources protected by the refuge have been important to local economies and helped drive growth in the region.\nImage Details\nCatastrophic wildfires are increasing and at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge, foresters and biologists are restoring more wildfire resilient forests.\nThe only mountainous mixed-conifer forest refuge in the lower 48, Little Pend Oreille encompasses six distinct forest zones and features species such as Douglas fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, western white pine, western red cedar, western hemlock, and subalpine fir. Fire has been an important part of the natural cycles in these refuge forests, but today they are burning hotter and faster than ever before. Invasive species like white pine blister rust and changes in forest management policy have contributed to the rise in these catastrophic wildfires. In some places, forest stands are too dense; and in others they need restoration through tree planting. The refuge uses weed management, tree and vegetation planting, and other science-based management tools to achieve conservation goals for forests and restore a more fire resilient ecosystem.\nImage Details\nUn-treated and treated with commercial thinning forest stands at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe buildup of ladder fuels–forest litter, brush and younger trees–causes wildfires to burn hotter, longer and faster. The more difficult and dangerous to combat fires can reach more mature trees and treetops and kills more trees. Prescribed fires can be used to mimic natural fires that once cleared old vegetation from the land helping native plants regenerate and local wildlife to thrive. Using carefully planned prescribed fire, the refuge can reduce ladder fuels to create more defensible forests.

King Spring, one of seven federal manatee sanctuaries set up from November to March, provides critical habitat for the over 600 manatees that migrate to Kings Bay each winter. In addition to the establishment of Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, manatees are also protected by the 2012 designation of the entire Kings Bay area as the Kings Bay Manatee Refuge (or Kings Bay Manatee Protection Area). Buzzard, Parker, and Banana islands provide habitat for bald eagles, osprey, wood storks, and many other shore birds.\nOur Mission\nCrystal River National Wildlife Refuge will strive to preserve, restore, and enhance the exceptional diversity of native flora and fauna of Kings Bay and the Three Sisters Springs for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.\nCrystal River National Wildlife Refuge habitat management goals will seek to maintain a healthy refuge environment that will provide opportunities for visitors to enjoy wildlife-dependent uses in a natural setting. Interpreting a unique assemblage of habitats, wildlife and the refuge’s historical heritage, as well as improving facilities that will enhance the visitor’s experience while protecting the ecological integrity of the area.\nTo meet these challenges, the Service will seek partnerships with other agencies, interest groups, and local communities. These efforts will result in greater protection of wildlife, fish, and plant resources throughout west-central Florida.\nOur History\nImage Details\n1983 - Establishment of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge\n2010 - Acquisition of the Three Sisters Springs property\n2019 - Finalization of the partnership agreement between Crystal River NWR, the City of Crystal River, and the Southwest Florida Water Management District for management, development, and maintenance of the Three Sisters Springs property\nOther Facilities in this Complex\nThree Sisters Springs Unit\nHistory, Acquisition and Current Partnership\nCitrus County fishermen, as far back as the 1920’s, piloted wooden skiffs up a long and winding creek from Kings Bay to Three Sisters armed with their fishing poles and empty jugs to fill with spring water.\nThree Sisters Springs was documented in a 1944 aerial photography prior to development (see image).
