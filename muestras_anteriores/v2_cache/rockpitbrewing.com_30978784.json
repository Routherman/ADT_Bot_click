      "text": "About The People You’ll See At RockPit\nThis is usually where you’ll find some boring story about how our brewery came to fruition and how we all were homebrewers and couldn’t think of doing anything else for the rest of our lives.\nAnd while that is certainly true, I’ve decided instead to dedicate this page to the kick-ass people you’ll run into at RockPit.\nHi, I’m Chris Rock (\nscroll all the way down the page to see me\n), one of the co-founders of RockPit Brewing and I want to introduce you to the people of RockPit in the best way possible; with bad glamour shots.\n** Updated 5/23/24: this page is being updated daily until all of our new staff pics are revealed at\nhttps://instagram.com/rockpitbrewing\nYou’ll see Britt almost every day at Rockpit doing two things: Slinging drinks and petting dogs.\nShe is, without a doubt, the first person you’ll encounter at Rockpit to ask, “Can I pet your dog?”\nIf you happen to see Britt outside of Rockpit (like in a cornfield), you’ll most likely see her doing two things: Crushing Busch Lights and petting dogs. 🤣\nNeedless to say, she really, really, really, REALLY loves dogs.\nSo the next time you’re at Rockpit with your dog, don’t be surprised to see a smiling woman beelining towards you, asking if they can pet your dog.\nCalista Rock (\n@calistarock\n) is our youngest bartender and my daughter. At any given moment, you’ll catch Calista in this exact pose snapping a selfie behind the bar, in a coffee shop, or while driving down I-4.\nWhen she’s not at RockPit slinging beer, she’s mentoring up-and-coming Instagram influencers on the optimal camera angle and facial expression to create the perfect profile pic for their LinkedIn, MySpace, or Geocities account to get them noticed – no matter what speed your modem is (including 14.4 kbps). So give us your best\n#badglamourshot\nthat you can feature on your own LinkedIn, Myspace or Geocities account.\nTammy Rock is my wife and one of the happiest people you’ll ever meet. She always has an infectious smile on her face, loves chatting with you, getting to know you, and slinging beer your way.\nShe also LOVES to make you laugh. It’s one of her most charming features.\nTammy channeled her inner 80’s party animal and donned some jorts, frizzy hair in a bright pink scrunchie, over accentuated makeup, and of course, a Queen t-shirt. One of her all-time favorite bands.\nGiven a choice to go back in time, you’d catch her at Live Aid in 1985, screaming the lyrics to “Radio Ga Ga” at Wembley Stadium.\nAfter the concert, she’d be pushing a keg of Rock Hard Water to the after-party where she’d no doubt be the center of attention.\nScott (\n@pirate.jeezus\n) is a veteran of the craft beer scene. He started at Tequesta Brewing Company 11 years ago, slinging drinks and cleaning tanks.\nAn excellent campfire guitar player (if you like Foo Fighters), he frequently travels to different cities to catch rock shows. Just be careful; the carnage he leaves behind after shredding the guitar can be catastrophic.\nThe next time you see him at Rockpit, check out the tattoos on his right arm. They reveal his favorite movie series.\nYeah, that’s me. And honestly, that’s how you’ll see me most of the time. Shorts, t-shirt, hat and lots of sawdust all over me from building stuff. In fact, when you come in and sit at any of our tables or bar, I had a hand in building it.\nI’m the marketing guy here at RockPit so I’m the one who convinces you to give us a try and gets you to come back over and over again. Mostly through the emails I send every week (\nclick here to sign up\n). They’ve been called “The only email I read every week” by hundreds of our customers. My hope is that you feel like you’re not in Florida anymore when you walk through our doors and you’re treated like a family member.\nIf you feel like that didn’t happen, shoot me an email to\nchris@rockpitbrewing.com\nand let me know about it. I’ll get it fixed for you.\nSean is our numbers cruncher and the one who ensures our crew and bills are paid. A pretty important part of keeping RockPit beer flowing your way.\nI brewed my first beer ever with Sean. It was a Foster’s Lager clone that was absolutely delicious. After brewing the beer he told me “One day, I’m going to open a brewery.” True to his word, we opened that brewery together eight years later.\nYou’ll often catch Sean in the taproom chatting it up with regulars or teaching customers how to enjoy the sours brewed here at RockPit. It’s earned him the nickname “The Sour Sherpa”.\nOur Location\n10 W Illiana St\nOrlando, FL 32806\n(407) 826-1773\nbeer@rockpitbrewing.com\nHours\nMonday – 12PM-10PM\nTuesday – 12PM-10PM\nThursday – 12PM-10PM\nWednesday – 12PM-10PM\nFriday – 12PM-12AM\nSunday – 12PM-8PM\nSaturday – 12PM-12AM\nDiscover more things to do in\nOrlando\nDownload The App, Get A Free Drink (and more!)\nThat’s right.
