It was created as an invitation for my extended human family to sample our identifiably unique taste and aroma which will give everyone “the reason to love jerk”. Our curated homemade blend of fresh herbs and spices, marinates naturally reared chicken and pork that results in our delicious, fire-licked goodness & shows why Hot Off De Grill is “The Jerk Spot For Everyone”.\nORDER ONLINE\nButton\n-\nLearn More\nHow We Got Started.\nJust after the cases of the corona virus began to decrease during the COVID pandemic, the opportunity presented itself to launch a new jerk concept in west Pembroke Pines. At the core, Hot Off De Grill is a “Jerk Spot” that sells Jamaican food. We put great importance on the integrity of choosing the best products and ingredients, with special attention to the authentic flavors and a modernized process. The result is a fast casual Jamaican concept that is making its mark in the Caribbean food scene.\n-\nContact Us\nSend Us A Message.\nHave a question?
