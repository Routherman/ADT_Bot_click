As the first wholly operational craft brewery in Fernandina Beach, we'd like to say that our beer is forged from the barrier island current and carved from the sandy dunes that surround us, but really it's just made from the finest malt and hops around.\nIn 2020, we decided to refocus our brewery brand and expand the restaurant to include a new taproom. Amelia Tavern is now\nThe Tavern By AIBC\n, and our new taproom space next door at 316 Centre Street is known as\nThe Alley By AIBC\n. Together, we are\nAmelia Island Brewing Company\n, or\nAIBC\nif you need to shorten it up.\nview our menu\nGallery Masonry\nWhen we say “Hold The Line”, we are declaring our commitment to doing it right. All of it. The brewing process. The ingredients. The restaurant. The people. The service. The demeanor. The brand. The outreach. The details. The quality. The atmosphere.\nThe choices considered, the decisions made, the strategy applied - it is all a collective reflection of our investment in making the right choice, for the right reasons, every chance we get. Hold the line.\nA barrier island faces the relentless salt waves, but instead of being worn away by the tide - our pride rolls along, holding strong. We do things differently. Not because it makes us different, but because we have no choice. Every ounce stands atop the reputation of castaways. Every sip is a measure of integrity. Of promises kept. We are who you hoped we’d be. We maintain the honor in things built, in beers crafted by hand and poured by the people. We hold the line.\nEvery time.\nWHAT IS THE AIBC Story?\nIn 2016, Amelia Tavern Restaurant & Brewpub opened on Centre Street to provide delicious local food and cold brews to the friends and guests of Amelia Island.
