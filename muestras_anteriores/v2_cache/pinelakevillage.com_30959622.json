Barding, began his career in  Manufactured Housing  (AKA Trailer and Mobile Homes) in 1946 in Decatur, Illinois.  After having 36 sales locations across the United States he built Park City to have a nice community in which to place these homes.  The community still exists and had 620 sites at the time that he sold and moved to Florida.\nRV/MH Hall of Fame\nOur Uncle, Jerry Barding, joined the Corporation in 1970 and Carol (Mom) later joined in 1982 after her three daughters were raised.  In the spring of 1973, Ralph purchased Golf View Estates in Pompano Beach, Florida.  He was just too dynamic to slow down and needed something to keep him busy.\nIn the spring of 1986 we sold Park City in Decatur, IL and purchased Pinelake Village, in Jensen Beach, Florida, which my family now owns and operates.\nOur Grandmother, Mary Barding, passed in 1992 and our Grandfather, Ralph Barding, passed on Christmas morning 2007 at the age of 96 years.\nSince purchasing Pinelake Village we have made several great improvements in the community.  Including a new swimming pool complex;  a complete remodel and refurbishing of the clubhouse. Martin County recently completed construction of a beautiful new bridge at our entrance.\nOnce you enter our office you will notice our family.  Nicole Stark, will greet you with a big smile and will be happy to guide you around our facilities.  Chris Burkard (part owner), President of our Board of Directors, is our General Manager and has her fingers on the pulse of Pinelake Village.

Other immediate family engaged in the corporation are Vicki Livasy (part owner) and Vice President on our Board of Directors. and her husband, Mark Livasy, serves on our Board of Directors.  We are a great family held corporation serving our residents as we ourselves would want to be served.  We would be remiss if I did not mention our CPA, Brad Himmel, that also serves on the Board of Directors.\n\"We are a family held corporation serving our residents\nas we ourselves, would want to be served.\"\nThank you for visiting our site.
