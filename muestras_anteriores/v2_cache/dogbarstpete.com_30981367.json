      "text": "About Us\nSit. Stay. Drink.\nThe Dog Bar is a combination of a private off leash dog park and a full service sports bar. Watch your dog play while you enjoy your favorite beverage! Located in the Grand Central District of St. Pete, this unique spot offers a hybrid between a private dog park and a full liquor, beer, and wine bar. Our unique concept is all about the dogs and we require our doggie patrons to have a membership, this helps us ensure that all of our pups are healthy and nonaggressive. There’s over 5,000 sq. ft. of off-leash indoor & outdoor areas for pups with separate areas for low energy dogs from the large play area. Both are turfed and feature misting fans to keep you cool in the summer and heaters to fight off the chill in winter. Although we do not serve food, you are more than welcome to order delivery from your favorite local restaurant or try one of the many food trucks we feature 7 days a week. We not only feature a full selection of your favorite cocktail choices, but our bar also offers 31 rotating draft beers many from local craft breweries as well as 40+ choices of canned brews. Two additional taps hold cold-brew coffee on nitro from Made Coffee, as well as a house-made Tito’s Moscow Mule.\nOur four separate areas allow you to enjoy the experience that suits you and your pup best. You can choose to play off leash in our 2,000 sq ft. fully fenced Astro-turfed yard that features plenty of seating and 5 TVs as well as a bone shaped pool. Our large yard will also be supervised by one of our Wooferees during peak hours. They are there to monitor play behavior and not as dog sitters. It’s important to keep an eye on your dog at all times. The large yard has easy access to the bar for your convenience and has a strict no food/no toys policy. Our establishment requires all dogs to be fixed after one year of age and provide proof of vaccines. Please read up on all of our rules on our membership page.\nFor those pups that don’t do well with the high action, busy pace of the large yard, we have a quiet corner of half astro turf- half indoor small yard. This yard features two televisions and low seating for the small pups to easily access. During the cooler months the garage door can be closed to allow for a climate controlled comfort not featured in the large yard.\nOur covered patio bar has 12+ bar stools to relax at the bar as well as 7 tables. The area is concrete and required on leash at all times. You will always have a great view of one of our 20 TVs placed throughout the bar. As well as comfortable spot to enjoy a meal from one of our rotating food trucks.\nWe also have a large off leash game room tucked away in the rear of the bar. This space is more of a lounge area with couch seating & a large projector for great game day viewing. We also feature multiple games including pool table, skee-ball, basketball game, and darts. This is a great space for our birthday party packages or to host a class.\nSee our membership page for specifics on Dog Bar memberships for your four-legged friend. Be sure to check out our event page to see what fun ways you can celebrate with your dog.\nREGISTER YOUR DOG NOW\nAbout\nAbout Us\nFAQ\nParty Packages\nCareers\nEvents\nEvents Calendar\nDogs & Dolphins Cruise\nBath Day 8.31\nBingo-Ritual Grounds 9.1\nYoga 9.7\nTaylorpalooza 9.20\nHours\nMon\n12PM - 12AM\nTue\n12PM - 12AM\nWed\n12PM - 12AM\nThur\n12PM - 12AM\nFri\n11AM - 12AM\nSat\n11AM - 12AM\nSunday\n11AM - 12AM\nFacebook-f\nInstagram\nTwitter\nRecent Posts\nSt. Pete’s Dog Bar is a howling good time\nMay 16, 2025\n5 Dog Parks That Are Also Bars\nSeptember 20, 2024\nThe Dog Bar Saint Pete\nJuly 16, 2023\nDog Bar St Pete: Where Paws and Pints Meet in St. Petersburg\nMay 30, 2023\nPhoto Gallery\nReviews\nMy partner and I brought our new puppy there today and Apollo made new friends and so did we!
