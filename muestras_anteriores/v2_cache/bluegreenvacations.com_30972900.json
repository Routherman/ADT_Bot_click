Our purpose is to provide our owners and guests with a great vacation experience, every time.\nWhy we do it\nWe believe in the power of vacation. We believe that vacations provide life-enriching experiences that, when shared with loved ones, can serve to strengthen bonds and provide a lifetime of cherished memories.\nHow we do it\nWe provide our valued owners with the opportunity to create unique vacation experiences at beautiful resorts and popular destinations across the U.S. and Caribbean, and deliver quality and value.\nWhat we do\nEstablished in 1966, Patten Realty, Inc. was a land management company that was later renamed Bluegreen Vacations®. Since that time, Bluegreen has grown to become a leader in vacation ownership. Our 220,000+ owners and their guests enjoy vacation experiences across a range of exciting destinations. They relax in style at unique resorts featuring spacious accommodations with all the comforts of home, plus vacation-enhancing amenities and a staff dedicated to making every stay a memorable one.\nOur Core Values\nThese values lie at the center of our company’s DNA. They provide a clear path towards achieving our purpose, which is to provide our owners and guests with a great vacation experience, every time. They also serve as a guideline for our associates in their interactions with each other.\nCustomer Obsession\nIf it matters to our customer, it matters to us.\nExcellence\nWe strive to exceed expectations in everything we do.\nSurprise & Delight\nWe want our customer care to be remarkable and memorable.\nInnovation\nWe are always looking to be better and develop our talent.\nSimplicity\nWe keep things as simple as possible.\nIntegrity\nWe do what is right, even when no one is looking.\nTrust\nWe believe in one another.\nAgility\nWe act with a sense of urgency and anticipation.\nPhilanthropy\nGiving Back\nBluegreen Vacations and our associates regularly donate resources, funds and their time to support a range of charitable and philanthropic organizations.\nOur philanthropy centers around our understanding that we are a part of the communities where we live and work. We believe in initiatives that effect a positive change, assist and empower those in need and protect and conserve the environment through social responsibility and sustainable practices.\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluegreenvacations.com/-/media/bgv/pdf/bluegreen vacations donation form 2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn-lg btn-frost btn-info\">Donation Request Form</a></p>\nThis global federation works to protect and care for children who have lost parental care, or who stand at risk of losing it. They work with communities, partners and states to ensure that the rights of all children, in every society, are fulfilled. They also work with families to help them build their capacities so that children are well cared for and families stay together.\nFamilies experiencing crises or extreme hardship may have difficulty caring adequately for their children. When children can no longer live with their families, SOS works with communities and state partners to provide children with loving and supportive alternative care.\nChristel House has been Bluegreen Vacations’ Charity of Choice since 2000. Christel DeHaan, a pioneer in the vacation industry and co-founder of Resort Condominiums International (RCI), founded Christel House in 1998. Christel House programs focus on education, nutrition and health care, life-skills training, character development and self-esteem to help break the cycle of poverty for children around the world and help them to become self-sufficient, productive members of their societies. Four nonresidential Christel House Learning Centers in Mexico, India, South Africa and the United States serve approximately 2,000 children.\nAll proceeds and contributions go directly to Christel House programs, while Ms. DeHaan underwrites all administrative costs. Bluegreen Vacations raises funds for Christel House through voluntary payroll deductions, golf tournaments, raffles and activities at our resorts.\nJA’s volunteer-delivered, kindergarten-12th grade programs foster work-readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy skills, and use experiential learning to inspire students to dream big and reach their potential.\nThey are the nation’s largest organization dedicated to giving young people the knowledge and skills they need to own their economic success, plan for their futures, and make smart academic and economic choices. Junior Achievement’s programs—in the core content areas of work readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy—ignite the spark in young people to experience and realize the opportunities and realities of work and life in the 21st century.\nAssociate Giving\nEvery year, Bluegreen Vacations associates get the unique opportunity to share which organizations mean the most to them. These are chosen to be a part of the Charity of the Month Program—a program that highlights a different organization each month for a year. This gives associates, and Bluegreen Vacations as a whole, an opportunity to have a broader impact in the community and stronger source of pride for the company.",
