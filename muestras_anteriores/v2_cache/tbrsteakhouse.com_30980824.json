His vision has always been to create a dining experience that combines top-notch quality with personalized service, all within a relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere. Our menu is centered around aged, black angus steaks, which serve as the foundation for a culinary journey that also includes fresh seafood, classic pasta dishes, unique appetizers, and delectable homemade desserts.\nAt The Back Room Steakhouse, we prioritize the use of fresh and high-quality ingredients in every meal we prepare. In addition to our exceptional food, we offer an extensive selection of fine wines, craft beers, signature craft cocktails, and a wide variety of spirits to perfectly complement your dining experience. We strive for perfection, but if for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your meal, please do not hesitate to reach out to Ed personally.\nThank you for choosing to visit us at The Back Room Steakhouse. It is an honor to have you as our guest, and we are eagerly looking forward to serving you and ensuring that your time with us is nothing short of extraordinary.\nFAQ’s\nWhat is your dress code?\nWe have a dress code at The Back Room Steakhouse that we like to refer to as \"Nice Casual\". We understand that our state has a very casual culture, and while we want our guests to feel comfortable, we also ask that they show respect for other patrons, especially since we often help celebrate special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries.\nFor men, we encourage wearing a collared shirt. Dress jeans, shorts, and sandals are acceptable, but we kindly request no tank tops, ball caps, tee shirts, or flip flops.\nWomen are also kindly asked to refrain from wearing flip flops.\nWe hope you have a wonderful visit and we sincerely appreciate your cooperation in adhering to our dress code.\nWhat should I expect?\nAs a small restaurant with a small kitchen, we highly recommend making a reservation to secure your table. While we do accept walk-ins, our tables tend to fill up quickly, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. If you prefer a quieter dining experience, Wednesday and Thursday nights are generally less busy, but we still suggest making a reservation to guarantee your spot.\nTo ensure that you have enough time to fully enjoy your meal, we have some general guidelines for meal service. For parties of two, a typical visit usually lasts around ninety minutes. This allows for a leisurely experience, including beverages, bread, salad, appetizers, entrees, and dessert. Larger parties may require more time, and our tables are paced accordingly to ensure that you can relax and savor each course. If you are in a rush or looking for a quick bite, we recommend visiting us when you have more time to fully appreciate the dining experience we offer.\nAt The Back Room Steakhouse, our motto is \"fine dining in an unpretentious environment,\" and we take pride in providing attentive and personalized customer service.
