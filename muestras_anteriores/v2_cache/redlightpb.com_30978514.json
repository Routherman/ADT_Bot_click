We were looking for a speak easy and came across this gem. The ambiance was perfectly set with the lighting, live jazz, craft cocktails, mouth watering food and our amazing server Talia.

She recommended the pork belly which was incredible then had the stuffed pork chop and the halibut for dinner which was so delicious. After dinner Julian recommended the chocolate chip bread pudding and it was to die for. Definitely will be back soon!\nKimberly Wolters\nMay 27, 2021\nSo fancy. Friendly staff. Love this place.\nAnna Lepeley\nMarch 8, 2021\nThis is a great location for that individual or couple that seeks that VIP feel and high end dining experience. I went on a Sunday when they feature comedians. The comedians were great and I will definitely be going back.\nJosh Velez\nFebruary 15, 2021\nThis file should primarily consist of HTML with a little bit of PHP.\nBobby Mac's comedy night was a blast.

Not too many places like this around and def not any this cool in South Florida.

Ask for Gemma, she sure is a gem 💎 Love this place, will definitely be frequenting often 😍\nAmanda Tulucci Uys\nOctober 14, 2020\nThis file should primarily consist of HTML with a little bit of PHP.\nFood was amazing as always and the service was nothing short of being perfect.\nDanny Rodriguez\nOctober 12, 2020\nWhat an experience. Red light is exactly what it is, a speakeasy. A hidden gem in plain sight, one might wonder the shenanigans you’re off to. But you’re enjoying a cocktail (or two) and a meal. The food is on a different level. The ambience puts you right back in the 1920’s in the most wonderful way. Date night, girls night, guys night, or just a night - Red Light is a wonderful escape from reality.\nMatthew Smidowicz\nOctober 10, 2020\nAmazing food and ambiance! Can’t wait to go back with my friends for pom margaritas and dinner. Also had wonderful live jazz music!\nHolly Shivery\nOctober 5, 2020\nThis file should primarily consist of HTML with a little bit of PHP.\nThe Red Light Palm Beach was an amazing experience. The ambiance was sultry, sophisticated and totally relaxing.
