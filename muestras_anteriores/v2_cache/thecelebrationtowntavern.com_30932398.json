Located across from the lake front in downtown Celebration, it is exactly what the family hoped to create — a space in which a person would be equally comfortable meeting friends for happy hour, taking the family for a night out, or spending the afternoon watching football in front of the big screen.\nClearly, this family knows what it’s doing when it sets out to create a neighborhood gathering spot. Originally from the Boston area, the family started in the business thirty years ago with a successful seafood restaurant in Weymouth called Kelly’s Landing. The family then moved to Fort Lauderdale to open a second Kelly’s Landing, a place so full of regulars it evokes images of\nCheers\n. Once again they relocated, this time to Celebration, where they opened the Celebration Town Tavern which has quickly become the town’s social hub.
