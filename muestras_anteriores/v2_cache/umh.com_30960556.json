These trailers were used during World War II to house factory workers that were manufacturing supplies for the military. After the war, there was not an affordable option for veterans. At this time, the home was still able to be moved rather easily from location to location. In the 1960’s consumer’s wanted bigger and better mobile homes. The product began to incorporate modern appliances and amenities. Realizing the oncoming boom of the industry, Eugene Landy founded United Mobile Homes, Inc. (now known as UMH Properties, Inc.). The Mobile Home industry was bound to succeed because of its unique ability to provide affordable housing to the masses. Mobile homes were a great form of housing for young families. The Mobile Home era ended on June 15, 1976 when the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Code was enacted. HUD Code is a federal standard that regulates the construction quality of these homes. This code is arguably stricter than many of the local building codes that stick built homes must comply with. In 1980, Congress officially adopted the term manufactured housing in an attempt to make it clear that this should be considered a building and not a vehicle.\nUMH has been in business since 1968, operating as a public company since 1985. The company offers extensive experience in developing, managing and expanding manufactured housing communities. This experience provides residents with an affordable, clean, and safe community lifestyle that they can be proud of. UMH is proud of our ability to reinvest in our communities and provide our residents with top of the line manufactured housing communities.\nWhen UMH Properties Inc. went public in 1985, the company owned 13 communities consisting of 2,675 homesites. Sam Landy was named President of UMH Properties, Inc. in 1994. In 2001, UMH owned 25 communities consisting of almost 6,000 homesites. Also in 2001, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. commenced so that we could sell these quality homes and provide financing to our prospective residents. Today, UMH Properties, Inc. owns and operates 144 manufactured home communities, containing approximately 26,800 developed homesites, of which 10,600 contain rental homes, and over 1,000 self-storage units. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. Included in the 144 communities are two communities in Florida, containing 363 sites, that UMH has an ownership interest in and operates through its joint venture with Nuveen Real Estate. It is clear that UMH Properties, Inc. has a long history of delivering quality affordable housing and a friendly community lifestyle to its residents. We have seen the ups and downs of real estate and are able to navigate both. UMH Properties, Inc. has been around for over 50 years and our operations are stronger than ever despite the difficult economic climate and the regulations imposed on the industry. Our long history has given us the experience necessary to grow our company, continually offer the best communities, and satisfy our residents.\n<div class=\"valign\">\n                            \n                        </div>\nWhat is a manufactured home?\nManufactured homes are, quite simply, homes that are built completely in a factory and then transported to a homesite for placement. Manufactured homes are built in a controlled setting where there are no weather delays, lost time, or damaged and stolen materials. Our homes offer all of the amenities of a traditional site-built home. They come in a wide variety of architectural styles, layouts, and sizes, though most are single-story homes. A single section manufactured home typically offers up to 1,000 square feet of living space, while a three section home could offer as much as 2,500 square feet. Because they are built in a factory with the efficiency of the assembly line process, manufactured homes are often more affordable than site built homes. They are also perfect for land-lease scenarios, where the homeowner rents only the lot upon which the home is situated.\nCheck out just some of the manufactured homes\nthat we offer.\nAll manufactured homes are subject to the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, also known as the HUD Code, established in 1976. These standards, many of which are more stringent than standards for site built homes, ensure that the homes meet regional standards for safety, durability, efficiency, roof load, wind resistance, and other important factors. Before the home leaves the factory, it is carefully inspected to ensure compliance with all aspects of the HUD Code.\n<div class=\"valign\">\n                            \n                        </div>\nWHAT IS A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY?\nUMH communities are known as Land-Lease communities, a housing development where a resident owns or rents a home and leases the lot underneath the home from the landowner. The Land-Lease arrangement allows a resident to experience the true privacy and independence of a single-family home, without spending the funds otherwise spent on land purchase. Unlike other affordable housing options, our residents have no common walls and they can enjoy a spacious yard. Those dreaming of home ownership can live in a three bedroom, two bathroom manufactured home for a similar cost to a one-bedroom apartment. In addition, residents in a UMH community can take comfort in knowing that community standards will be carefully maintained, while enjoying the many social and recreational amenities.\nBENEFITS OF A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY\n– Neighborly feeling that instills a stronger sense of community\n– Amenities offered at most of our communities, such as community clubhouses, playgrounds, swimming pools, basketball/tennis courts, fitness centers, and storage facilities for RVs and boats\n– Resident events and social gatherings for all residents\nFinancial Benefits of Living in a Land-Lease Community\n– Money that would have been spent on land is now free for other purposes\n– Minimal closing costs, freeing up money to invest elsewhere\n– Lower maintenance costs\n– Access to competitive Financing (for qualified buyers)\n<div class=\"valign\">\n                            \n                        </div>\nUMH Financing\nWe understand.\nLet’s face it, times are tough. Most homebuyers are concerned with their ability to borrow money to purchase a home. At UMH, we understand that everyone’s situation is unique. We have licensed Mortgage Professionals eager to discuss options that may be available for your home purchase.\nAccess to financing.\nUMH Sales and Finance, Inc. is an available option to help clients realize the American dream of homeownership.

The staff is caring & safety has not been an issue since 2002 when we moved in. Thank you for providing a nice community to live.\nLorie B.\nSouthwind is a beautiful community that sticks together. I love raising my son here, but the best story I have is of my cat Zeppy. He got out, and I looked day and night for two weeks in bad storms. More time passed and I had lost all hope of bringing our Zeppy home by Christmas. I cried putting up our tree and the most amazing thing happened: my phone started ringing Zeppy was spotted and a whole community of people that did not even know my name came together. They spread my number around, put food out, even safe traps! One week before Xmas we got our Zeppy back. If it was not for the amazing people in our community coming together to help I don't think we would have ever gotten Zeppy back. Southwind is an amazing place to live, and raise a family but the best part is the family of friends and neighbors that you find when you move in.\nJolene M.\nquiet ,good neighbors,effective management\nBrad S.\nIt is very quiet, considering there are so many children and Dogs who live in the neighborhood.

Living here over 25 years now, I have seen it evolve. When the Wolfe family took over the management of the park they made a contribution UMH could never repay them for. They turned this park around and have never stopped improving it. They don't hesitate to help when they can, address issues, resolve problems and are competent and compassionate with their residents!

These trailers were used during World War II to house factory workers that were manufacturing supplies for the military. After the war, there was not an affordable option for veterans. At this time, the home was still able to be moved rather easily from location to location. In the 1960’s consumer’s wanted bigger and better mobile homes. The product began to incorporate modern appliances and amenities. Realizing the oncoming boom of the industry, Eugene Landy founded United Mobile Homes, Inc. (now known as UMH Properties, Inc.). The Mobile Home industry was bound to succeed because of its unique ability to provide affordable housing to the masses. Mobile homes were a great form of housing for young families. The Mobile Home era ended on June 15, 1976 when the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Code was enacted. HUD Code is a federal standard that regulates the construction quality of these homes. This code is arguably stricter than many of the local building codes that stick built homes must comply with. In 1980, Congress officially adopted the term manufactured housing in an attempt to make it clear that this should be considered a building and not a vehicle.\nUMH has been in business since 1968, operating as a public company since 1985. The company offers extensive experience in developing, managing and expanding manufactured housing communities. This experience provides residents with an affordable, clean, and safe community lifestyle that they can be proud of. UMH is proud of our ability to reinvest in our communities and provide our residents with top of the line manufactured housing communities.\nWhen UMH Properties Inc. went public in 1985, the company owned 13 communities consisting of 2,675 homesites. Sam Landy was named President of UMH Properties, Inc. in 1994. In 2001, UMH owned 25 communities consisting of almost 6,000 homesites. Also in 2001, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. commenced so that we could sell these quality homes and provide financing to our prospective residents. Today, UMH Properties, Inc. owns and operates 144 manufactured home communities, containing approximately 26,800 developed homesites, of which 10,600 contain rental homes, and over 1,000 self-storage units. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. Included in the 144 communities are two communities in Florida, containing 363 sites, that UMH has an ownership interest in and operates through its joint venture with Nuveen Real Estate. It is clear that UMH Properties, Inc. has a long history of delivering quality affordable housing and a friendly community lifestyle to its residents. We have seen the ups and downs of real estate and are able to navigate both. UMH Properties, Inc. has been around for over 50 years and our operations are stronger than ever despite the difficult economic climate and the regulations imposed on the industry. Our long history has given us the experience necessary to grow our company, continually offer the best communities, and satisfy our residents.\n<div class=\"valign\">\n                            \n                        </div>\nWhat is a manufactured home?\nManufactured homes are, quite simply, homes that are built completely in a factory and then transported to a homesite for placement. Manufactured homes are built in a controlled setting where there are no weather delays, lost time, or damaged and stolen materials. Our homes offer all of the amenities of a traditional site-built home. They come in a wide variety of architectural styles, layouts, and sizes, though most are single-story homes. A single section manufactured home typically offers up to 1,000 square feet of living space, while a three section home could offer as much as 2,500 square feet. Because they are built in a factory with the efficiency of the assembly line process, manufactured homes are often more affordable than site built homes. They are also perfect for land-lease scenarios, where the homeowner rents only the lot upon which the home is situated.\nCheck out just some of the manufactured homes\nthat we offer.\nAll manufactured homes are subject to the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, also known as the HUD Code, established in 1976. These standards, many of which are more stringent than standards for site built homes, ensure that the homes meet regional standards for safety, durability, efficiency, roof load, wind resistance, and other important factors. Before the home leaves the factory, it is carefully inspected to ensure compliance with all aspects of the HUD Code.\n<div class=\"valign\">\n                            \n                        </div>\nWHAT IS A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY?\nUMH communities are known as Land-Lease communities, a housing development where a resident owns or rents a home and leases the lot underneath the home from the landowner. The Land-Lease arrangement allows a resident to experience the true privacy and independence of a single-family home, without spending the funds otherwise spent on land purchase. Unlike other affordable housing options, our residents have no common walls and they can enjoy a spacious yard. Those dreaming of home ownership can live in a three bedroom, two bathroom manufactured home for a similar cost to a one-bedroom apartment. In addition, residents in a UMH community can take comfort in knowing that community standards will be carefully maintained, while enjoying the many social and recreational amenities.\nBENEFITS OF A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY\n– Neighborly feeling that instills a stronger sense of community\n– Amenities offered at most of our communities, such as community clubhouses, playgrounds, swimming pools, basketball/tennis courts, fitness centers, and storage facilities for RVs and boats\n– Resident events and social gatherings for all residents\nFinancial Benefits of Living in a Land-Lease Community\n– Money that would have been spent on land is now free for other purposes\n– Minimal closing costs, freeing up money to invest elsewhere\n– Lower maintenance costs\n– Access to competitive Financing (for qualified buyers)\n<div class=\"valign\">\n                            \n                        </div>\nUMH Financing\nWe understand.\nLet’s face it, times are tough.

The staff is caring & safety has not been an issue since 2002 when we moved in. Thank you for providing a nice community to live.\nLorie B.\nSouthwind is a beautiful community that sticks together. I love raising my son here, but the best story I have is of my cat Zeppy. He got out, and I looked day and night for two weeks in bad storms. More time passed and I had lost all hope of bringing our Zeppy home by Christmas. I cried putting up our tree and the most amazing thing happened: my phone started ringing Zeppy was spotted and a whole community of people that did not even know my name came together. They spread my number around, put food out, even safe traps! One week before Xmas we got our Zeppy back. If it was not for the amazing people in our community coming together to help I don't think we would have ever gotten Zeppy back. Southwind is an amazing place to live, and raise a family but the best part is the family of friends and neighbors that you find when you move in.\nJolene M.\nquiet ,good neighbors,effective management\nBrad S.\nIt is very quiet, considering there are so many children and Dogs who live in the neighborhood.

Living here over 25 years now, I have seen it evolve. When the Wolfe family took over the management of the park they made a contribution UMH could never repay them for. They turned this park around and have never stopped improving it. They don't hesitate to help when they can, address issues, resolve problems and are competent and compassionate with their residents! Norma always amazed me how she takes time to know every family. And her Team is always working to improve the park and keep it clean. This community will forever hold a piece of my heart. We are proud to live in Highland Estates and pray the Wolfe's never retire!\nI highly suggest anyone looking for a peaceful community to call home, to check Highland Estates out, a safe neighborhood where you can hang your hat and proudly hang your American flag too.

So my husband and I thank you and toast to you for all you do year after year!\nTeresa H.\nI truly want to reach out and thank Nikki and the entire staff here for their help. I am a healthcare worker that has been working many physical and emotionally draining hours.

Will continue to enjoy living here and will recommend to others as well!\nKatie D.\nBeautiful home and awesome move-in experience.

When we discovered Brookview Village in Greenfield Center, NY we were so impressed with the homes, large yards, and how clean and green the community is. We were hooked and well rewarded with a delightful community of friends and families, and the perks of having an AMTRAK and Greyhound Station 3 1/2 miles away. Satatoga Springs barely 8 miles, Lake George 20 miles, and Albany just an easy commute makes this community a great spot to live. We have a very dependable and reliable UMH manager and staff whenever we need.
