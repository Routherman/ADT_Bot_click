Notwithstanding anything in these Rules and Regulations to the contrary, all guests, residents, visitors and other occupants (collectively, \"guests\") are required to comply with all rules and regulations posted at the property, as well as all directions of the resort management and team. We reserve the right to remove from the resort anyone in violation of these Rules and Regulations, or any rules or regulations posted at the resort. There are no refunds for voluntary departure, eviction, acts of nature or removal in accordance with these Rules and Regulations or by law enforcement or court order.\nIn the event, in connection with your stay, you are required to sign a reservation agreement, lease, RV placement agreement or any other document, and the terms of such document directly conflict with these Rules and Regulations, the terms of that document shall control.\nThese Rules and Regulations are subject to change at any time without notice.\nRESERVATION PAYMENT POLICY\nAll reservations for less than 30 nights require a deposit of two nights or half of your stay, whichever is greater. All reservations for 30 nights or longer require a deposit of $500. Deposits are refundable only in accordance with the Cancellation Policy below. The full balance of the reservation will be due and payable upon arrival. A valid credit card is required to be on file for all reservations, which Sun Outdoors has the right to charge for any unpaid amounts owed by the guest, or for such other amounts that are the responsibility of the guest (including, without limitation, property damage caused by a guest), in accordance with applicable law. Personal checks are not accepted at check-in.\nRESORT FEES, OTHER FEES & TAXES\nCertain properties charge a daily resort fee, which is added to each reservation for certain amenities made available to guests. These amenities vary by property, but may include Wi-Fi internet, basic cable (where applicable), various activities, access to onsite facilities and more. Sun does not guarantee that amenities will be available to guests at all times, as certain amenities are subject to seasonal closures, closure for repair, maintenance, or other purposes, or may not have capacity to accommodate all guests at the desired time of use. For a more detailed description of available amenities, please visit each individual property website. In addition, there may be additional fees (e.g. site lock fees) and taxes applicable to your stay.\nAny fees and taxes applicable to your reservation will be clearly identified in advance of your booking during the booking process, and in the confirmation email you receive upon completion of your booking.\nCANCELLATION POLICY\nNightly/Weekly Stays: For all guests with stays shorter than 30 nights (\"short-term guests\") (i) cancellations may be made for a full refund of your deposit up to the date that is 14 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, (ii) cancellations made after the date that is 14 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, but prior to arrival, will be subject to a cancellation fee equal to all required deposits previously paid, and (iii) no refunds will be given for any cancellation following your check-in date. All refunds will be made in the same form of payment used to secure the reservation.\nMonthly or Longer Stays: For all guests with stays of 30 nights or longer (\"long-term guests\") (i) cancellations may be made for a full refund of your deposit up to the date that is 45 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, (ii) cancellations made after the date that is 45 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, but prior to arrival, will be subject to a cancellation fee equal to all required deposits previously paid, and (iii) no refunds will be given for any cancellation following your check-in date. All refunds will be made in the same form of payment used to secure the reservation.\nThe booking fee is fully refundable if you cancel your reservation within 24 hours of booking. After 24 hours, the booking fee is refundable only if your reservation is also fully refundable at the time of cancellation. For any questions about the booking fee, contact support@campspot.com.\nCHECK-IN & CHECK-OUT TIMES\nRV/Tent Sites\nCheck-in Time: 2 p.m.\nCheck-Out Time: 11 a.m.\nVacation Rentals\nCheck-in Time: 3 p.m.\nCheck-Out Time: 11 a.m.\nEarly check-in may be available for an additional fee of $30; contact the resort office the morning of your arrival for availability. Late check-outs may be available for an additional fee of $30; check with the resort office on your day of departure for availability.\nAny guests that have not shown up 24 hours after their check-in time, and have not made prior arrangements with the resort staff, will be considered a no-show reservation and forfeit their deposit.\nGUEST ARRIVAL & DEPARTURE INFORMATION FOR SEASONAL GUESTS\nGuests staying for the duration of the season at a seasonally operated resort, where their RV may remain on the property year round, may arrive any time after 9:00 am on opening day for the resort's season and must vacate the resort no later than 5:00pm on closing day for the resort's season. Seasonal guests are required to check-in and check-out with the welcome center on the initial date of arrival and last date of departure for the season. Payment in full for any outstanding balance owed by the guest is due prior to initial check-in for the season.\nSITE LOCATIONS & TENT ACCOMMODATIONS\nAll site numbers are subject to change prior to arrival unless a site lock fee was paid with your reservation. Only certified RV types are permitted unless prevented by specific site constraints, this includes Class A, B, and C Motorhomes, 5th wheels, and travel trailers. We reserve the right to inspect any personal property that you bring into the resort, and we may refuse access if your property is not properly constructed, is unsafe, or is unsuitable for the resort. Tents, pop up campers, and conversion vans are only permitted on designated sites. Sites are designed to accommodate one unit at a time. Only one \"pup\" tent may act as a secondary unit on a site at the discretion of Sun Outdoors as site size allows, and must be taken down during the day. One dining canopy tent is permitted, but may not be up in conjunction with a \"pup\" tent, and must be properly secured at all times. Sites must be cleaned up of garbage and debris prior to departure. Additional charges may result for sites requiring additional cleaning.\nPERMITTED OCCUPANTS\nAll reservations include a maximum of 6 guests unless otherwise stated. Rates are based on the maximum occupancy of the site. For all-age resorts, the individual reserving the site must be a minimum of 18 years of age and be physically present at the time of check-in. Children 14 and under must be supervised by an adult 18 year of age or over at all times.\nVISITORS\nGuests may have visitors (individuals not registered on the reservation or agreement) visit them, so long as such visitors do not cause the guest to exceed the maximum permitted occupancy listed above. Visitors must register at the welcome center and are subject to any applicable guest fees. For short-term guests, the daily visitor fee is $10 per person, or a non-transferrable seasonal visitor pass may be purchased for $150 per person, where applicable.\nAt annual resorts in Arizona and Florida, there will be no charge for the first 14 days a visitor stays with a guest; however, beginning on the 15th day of a visitor's stay, there will be an additional charge of $10 per day per visitor, payable in advance.\nVisitors are required to abide by all Resort Rules and Regulations. Guests are responsible for the behavior of their visitors. Visitors are only permitted to be on property when resort guests are present. It is the responsibility of the guests to come into the welcome center to register all visitors.\nPHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO CONSENT\nAs part of Sun Outdoors' marketing and other efforts we may sometimes take pictures, video or audio recordings of the resort and our guests and visitors. In choosing to stay at one of our resorts, each guest and visitor present on the property hereby consents to our capture and use of voice recordings, images, videos, and likeness for any marketing or other purposes not prohibited by law, indefinitely, and without payment of any royalty, licensing or other fees whatsoever. If any minor children are present, their legal guardian is required to let the manager know at the time a photo or video is taken that permission is not given to use their likeness for any marketing purposes.\nAMENITIES & FACILITIES\nWe encourage you to visit the individual property website for specific information and dates relating to on-site amenity closures and other property specific information. Please remember that many amenities are on a seasonal and weather dependent schedule that may have limited hours during the off-season. We reserve the right to close any facilities at our discretion without prior notice, and without refund of any fees or other amounts paid for the reservation. Please refer to posted rules and regulations throughout the property for additional information on our amenities. All amenities are use at your own risk. Swimming and boating may only occur in designated areas where these amenities are offered. Specific locations require guests to display their property-issued wristband or photo name badge at all times while on site, as well as for access to amenities. All persons must wear dry shirt, pants and shoes when entering the Welcome Center or any facility building.\nCAR PASSES & GATE CARDS\nTwo vehicles, inclusive of one RV (other than for vacation rentals), are included with each reservation or agreement as determined by Sun Outdoors and as space allows. Additional vehicles for registered guests are $10 per day or, where offered, $150 for an annual pass, and subject to availability of parking in designated areas. Car passes are issued to registered guests listed on the reservation or agreement only and must be visible at all times. Car passes are not transferrable and may not be shared with another guest or visitor. All guests' vehicles must be parked on their designated site and may not stick out into the road. If parking is limited or not available on a particular site, then vehicles must be parked in one of the resort's designated parking areas, if available. Under no circumstances are guests permitted to occupy sites not included in their reservation, even if not otherwise occupied. Unregistered vehicles found without a pass may be towed at the owner's expense. Car covers and wheel covers are permitted if factory made and in acceptable appearance and in good condition. Car covers must be properly secured to the vehicle, weights to hold the cover down are not allowed. Any lost or unreturned gate cards will result in a $25 replacement fee. Gate access cards are only applicable at specific locations; not all locations are gated, or require a gate card.\nQUIET HOURS\nOur quiet hours are from 11pm - 8am daily, unless otherwise dictated by on-site staff or local regulations. Please be courteous to your fellow guests during all hours of the day. During quiet hours, no loud talking, loud radios, loud televisions or other loud noises or behavior that may disturb guests is permitted. The use of generators are not permitted on the property, unless prior approval from management is granted.\nRESPECT YOUR NEIGHBOR\nPlease be considerate of your neighbors' privacy and space. Do not walk on or pass through the site of another guest. Respect our local culture, wildlife, and those around you. Please be mindful of our local bylaws and conservation of resources. We are proud to promote an inclusive and family friendly atmosphere at all our resorts. Harassment or offensive or intolerant language or actions will not be tolerated in any form, included with respect to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or political views. Flags, signs or other visual symbols that contain vulgarity, depict the Confederate flag, or represent politicians or political candidates are not permitted to be displayed. We reserve the right to immediately evict any guest, without refund, for failure to comply with these rules and/or staff's request for you to remove the display of offensive visuals or symbols.\nLOCAL WILDLIFE\nPlease respect our local wildlife. Use caution when near bodies of water or natural brush, as some of the local wildlife is dangerous and should be left alone. Some of the local wildlife is protected by State Law. Feeding, killing, abusing or otherwise disturbing the wildlife is strictly prohibited. Additionally, feeding stray animals, including but not limited to cats or birds is prohibited.\nSMOKING & ALCOHOL\nThere is no smoking, including vaping, allowed in vacation or cottage rentals, resort restrooms and shower facilities, indoor facilities, common areas, or any outdoor amenities. Smoking is allowed on your own site as long as it is done so in a way that will not directly or indirectly impact the experience of other guests. Alcohol is permitted by legal drinking age adults as long as it is done so in a way that will not directly or indirectly impact the experience of other guests. Alcohol must be consumed in a responsible manner, and may be restricted in certain areas of the resort. Illegal drugs are strictly prohibited. Any guests or visitors that are smoking or using alcohol in an irresponsible manner, or in a manner that interferes with another guest's enjoyment will be asked to stop and may be asked to leave or removed for failure to comply.\nSITE SAFETY\nEach site is generally provided one table, as well as one fire pit if allowed by local regulations. Please do not burn or leave trash in fire pits, and do not move pits without permission from the staff. All fires must be contained to the pit/ring, and are permitted only from 8am -Midnight. Never leave a fire unattended. County bans may occur and will be posted at the welcome center. Any chemicals or toxic materials must remain locked up at all times, or safely removed from the access of children or animals.\nDANGEROUS CONDITIONS\nWhile it is always our priority to allow guests the peaceful and undisturbed enjoyment of their site, in the event a resort team member believes, in their reasonable discretion, that an emergency or dangerous condition exists on a guest's site, which could potentially pose a risk of harm to any person or property, the resort team has the right to enter the guest's site and access any area or unit on the site, in order to remedy the emergency or dangerous condition, or prevent or mitigate the potential harm.\nPETS\nWe are a pet-friendly resort but pets may not disturb other guests, and must be cleaned up after by owners. Pets must always be on a leash and restrained when not confined inside an RV, and no pet may be left unattended outside of an RV, even on the site or if restrained. There is a maximum of two pets per reservation with a $50 non-refundable fee per reservation for any pet in a vacation or cottage rental. Pets are the responsibility of the owner. If management determines that a pet is disruptive or aggressive, they have sole discretion to require the guest to restrict the pet's behavior or location, or remove the pet from the resort. If a guest is unwilling or unable to restrict the pet or have it removed from the resort, as requested by management, management has the right to immediately terminate the guest's reservation and evict the guest from the resort, without refund. All pets must also be up to date on vaccines, and copies of pet vaccine records must be available upon request. Upon check-in, you are required to notify the office of your pets if you have not already added them to your reservation during the booking process.\nGARBAGE & RECYCLING\nAny household garbage and recycling are to be put in the designated areas, garbage bins and recycling receptacles located on the resort map. Select resorts may offer garbage pickup services. Disposal of hazardous waste or large items such as mattresses, couches, or chairs, is not permitted on property and should be taken to a local dump facility. Additional charges may result for unapproved disposal of items.\nSEWER HOOKUP\nAll sewer hoses must be undamaged, and sewer connections must be tight with a sewer donut around the sewer hose at the point of connection to the sewer pipe. Sewer hoses must be sloped downward from the RV's sewer connection to the resort sewer hookup to prevent any clogging or spillage on the ground. Any damaged or leaking hose must be repaired immediately. Guests are responsible, and will be charged, for any damages caused by the guest's sewer hookup.\nELECTRICITY\nSite electric pedestals are owned by the resort - any guest found tampering with electrical pedestals will be removed from the resort without any refund. Guests should not be overloading electric pedestals and should be utilizing code-compliant, approved outdoor extension cords. Connecting electric to washers and dryers inside private sheds is not permitted.

We reserve the right to inspect any personal property that you bring into the resort, and we may refuse access if your property is not properly constructed, is unsafe, or is unsuitable for the resort. Tents, pop up campers, and conversion vans are only permitted on designated sites. Sites are designed to accommodate one unit at a time.

Guests are responsible for the behavior of their visitors. Visitors are only permitted to be on property when resort guests are present. It is the responsibility of the guests to come into the welcome center to register all visitors.\nPHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO CONSENT\nAs part of Sun Outdoors' marketing and other efforts we may sometimes take pictures, video or audio recordings of the resort and our guests and visitors. In choosing to stay at one of our resorts, each guest and visitor present on the property hereby consents to our capture and use of voice recordings, images, videos, and likeness for any marketing or other purposes not prohibited by law, indefinitely, and without payment of any royalty, licensing or other fees whatsoever. If any minor children are present, their legal guardian is required to let the manager know at the time a photo or video is taken that permission is not given to use their likeness for any marketing purposes.\nAMENITIES & FACILITIES\nWe encourage you to visit the individual property website for specific information and dates relating to on-site amenity closures and other property specific information.

Failure to register may result in a guest's removal. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, all long-term guests who are registered for a stay exceeding six (6) months, or who continuously occupy a site in excess of six (6) months, must apply and receive approval for residency from the resort office. An application for non-transient residency may require the payment of an application fee and a financial and/or criminal background check. Unless the guest signs a written lease stating otherwise, all approved long-term guests shall be subject to a month-to-month tenancy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all residents or applicants for residency must comply with all applicable laws.\n55+ RESORTS\nCertain resorts are intended, operated, and maintained for the occupancy, use and benefit of persons 55 years of age or older. Those specific resorts adhere to and enforce the requirements of the \"Housing for Older Persons Act\" of 1995. Consequently, at least 80% of the occupied homes in 55+ resorts must be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older as of the date of occupancy. In the event the oldest occupant of a home dies or vacates the home, the remaining occupant(s) may continue as a guest(s) of the resort and an occupant of the home as long as at least 80% of the occupied homes in the resort, including that occupied by the remaining guest(s) are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. Notwithstanding this express policy and intent to the contrary, resort management reserves the right in its sole discretion to accept a new guest who is less than 55 years of age as long as at least 80% of the occupied homes, including that of the new guest, are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older and no one under the age of 35.\nOCCUPANCY AND STORAGE ARRANGEMENTS\nCertain resorts only permit guests to occupy their site for 6 or 7 months per year, and require them to vacate the community for the remaining months of the year, while allowing them to keep their RV or home on site, or may otherwise restrict a guest's stay to no more than 6 or 7 months. These arrangements are sometimes referred to as 6&6 or 7&5 arrangements. At these applicable resorts, the grandfathered 7&5 and 6&6 payment plan year begins on your move in anniversary date of each year. The 6 or 7 months of occupancy may occur between your anniversary dates of each year. Unused time may not be carried over and will not be refunded. All 7&5 and 6&6 guests MUST check in and out with the resort office each time they arrive and depart. Extended occupancy time beyond 6 or 7 months, as applicable, will be charged additional market rate.\nOCCUPANCY RESTRICTIONS\nNotwithstanding anything else in these Rules and Regulations to the contrary, all guests must comply with state and local requirements related to permitted length of stay, use restrictions and any other laws, rules, regulations or restrictions applicable to the resort.\nMISCELLANEOUS TENANT PROTECTIONS AT ORANGE CITY AND ARBOR TERRACE ONLY\nNotwithstanding anything else in these Rules and Regulations to the contrary, lease terms for the Orange City and Arbor Terrace communities shall be for one year, commencing on the date of the original lease contract date, and continuing for twelve (12) months, unless sooner terminated as provided in the Lease Agreement, and renewable at the option of the tenants unless good cause exists for nonrenewal. Tenants shall have a five (5) day grace period after the due date for the payment of the rent. Tenants shall have the right to cure defaults for nonpayment of the rent. The community shall provide a tenant with a minimum of thirty (30) days written notice prior to any increase in the rent. The community agrees to provide a tenant no less than sixty (60) days written notice prior to any planned sale or closure of the community. If a tenant is evicted from the community, the tenant shall have the right to sell their manufactured home, if applicable, in place within forty-five (45) days after the eviction. Tenants may post a \"for sale\" sign on their manufactured home, if applicable, of such size and at such locations as may be reasonably required by the community. Tenants may sell their manufactured home, if applicable, without having to first relocate it out of the community. Tenants may sublease their manufactured home, if applicable, or assign the community Lease Agreement to a buyer of the manufactured home, if applicable, provided the buyer or sublessee meets the community's minimum rules, regulations, and credit quality.\nLIABILITY\nBy accepting this reservation, the guest hereby waives, releases and discharges and covenants not to sue Sun Communities, Inc. or its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, managers, employees, agents, successors or assigns (collectively, the \"Sun Parties\") for all claims and liability for personal injury, accidents, property damage, any other claim arising out of or in connection with the guest's use of the resort or property. Further, the guest agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Sun Parties from all losses, claims, expenses and demands, including attorneys' fees, that the Sun Parties may incur arising out of or in connection with the guest's use of the resort and property.

In addition, there may be additional fees (e.g. site lock fees) and taxes applicable to your stay.\nAny fees and taxes applicable to your reservation will be clearly identified in advance of your booking during the booking process, and in the confirmation email you receive upon completion of your booking.\nCANCELLATION POLICY\nNightly/Weekly Stays: For all guests with stays shorter than 30 nights (\"short-term guests\") (i) cancellations may be made for a full refund of your deposit up to the date that is 14 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, (ii) cancellations made after the date that is 14 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, but prior to arrival, will be subject to a cancellation fee equal to all required deposits previously paid, and (iii) no refunds will be given for any cancellation following your check-in date. All refunds will be made in the same form of payment used to secure the reservation.\nMonthly or Longer Stays: For all guests with stays of 30 nights or longer (\"long-term guests\") (i) cancellations may be made for a full refund of your deposit up to the date that is 45 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, (ii) cancellations made after the date that is 45 days prior to your scheduled check-in date, but prior to arrival, will be subject to a cancellation fee equal to all required deposits previously paid, and (iii) no refunds will be given for any cancellation following your check-in date.

Seasonal guests are required to check-in and check-out with the welcome center on the initial date of arrival and last date of departure for the season. Payment in full for any outstanding balance owed by the guest is due prior to initial check-in for the season.\nSITE LOCATIONS & TENT ACCOMMODATIONS\nAll site numbers are subject to change prior to arrival unless a site lock fee was paid with your reservation. Only certified RV types are permitted unless prevented by specific site constraints, this includes Class A, B, and C Motorhomes, 5th wheels, and travel trailers. We reserve the right to inspect any personal property that you bring into the resort, and we may refuse access if your property is not properly constructed, is unsafe, or is unsuitable for the resort. Tents, pop up campers, and conversion vans are only permitted on designated sites. Sites are designed to accommodate one unit at a time. Only one \"pup\" tent may act as a secondary unit on a site at the discretion of Sun Outdoors as site size allows, and must be taken down during the day. One dining canopy tent is permitted, but may not be up in conjunction with a \"pup\" tent, and must be properly secured at all times. Sites must be cleaned up of garbage and debris prior to departure. Additional charges may result for sites requiring additional cleaning.\nPERMITTED OCCUPANTS\nAll reservations include a maximum of 6 guests unless otherwise stated. Rates are based on the maximum occupancy of the site. For all-age resorts, the individual reserving the site must be a minimum of 18 years of age and be physically present at the time of check-in. Children 14 and under must be supervised by an adult 18 year of age or over at all times.\nVISITORS\nGuests may have visitors (individuals not registered on the reservation or agreement) visit them, so long as such visitors do not cause the guest to exceed the maximum permitted occupancy listed above. Visitors must register at the welcome center and are subject to any applicable guest fees. For short-term guests, the daily visitor fee is $15 per person, or a non-transferrable seasonal visitor pass may be purchased for $150 per person, where applicable.\nAt annual resorts in Arizona and Florida, there will be no charge for the first 14 days a visitor stays with a guest; however, beginning on the 15th day of a visitor's stay, there will be an additional charge of $15 per day per visitor, payable in advance.\nVisitors are required to abide by all Resort Rules and Regulations. Guests are responsible for the behavior of their visitors. Visitors are only permitted to be on property when resort guests are present. It is the responsibility of the guests to come into the welcome center to register all visitors.\nPHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO CONSENT\nAs part of Sun Outdoors' marketing and other efforts we may sometimes take pictures, video or audio recordings of the resort and our guests and visitors. In choosing to stay at one of our resorts, each guest and visitor present on the property hereby consents to our capture and use of voice recordings, images, videos, and likeness for any marketing or other purposes not prohibited by law, indefinitely, and without payment of any royalty, licensing or other fees whatsoever. If any minor children are present, their legal guardian is required to let the manager know at the time a photo or video is taken that permission is not given to use their likeness for any marketing purposes.\nAMENITIES & FACILITIES\nWe encourage you to visit the individual property website for specific information and dates relating to on-site amenity closures and other property specific information. Please remember that many amenities are on a seasonal and weather dependent schedule that may have limited hours during the off-season. We reserve the right to close any facilities at our discretion without prior notice, and without refund of any fees or other amounts paid for the reservation. Please refer to posted rules and regulations throughout the property for additional information on our amenities. All amenities are use at your own risk. Swimming and boating may only occur in designated areas where these amenities are offered. Specific locations require guests to display their property-issued wristband or photo name badge at all times while on site, as well as for access to amenities. All persons must wear dry shirt, pants and shoes when entering the Welcome Center or any facility building.\nCAR PASSES & GATE CARDS\nTwo vehicles, inclusive of one RV (other than for vacation rentals), are included with each reservation or agreement as determined by Sun Outdoors and as space allows. Additional vehicles for registered guests are $15 per day or, where offered, $150 for an annual pass, and subject to availability of parking in designated areas. Car passes are issued to registered guests listed on the reservation or agreement only and must be visible at all times. Car passes are not transferrable and may not be shared with another guest or visitor. All guests' vehicles must be parked on their designated site and may not stick out into the road. If parking is limited or not available on a particular site, then vehicles must be parked in one of the resort's designated parking areas, if available. Under no circumstances are guests permitted to occupy sites not included in their reservation, even if not otherwise occupied. Unregistered vehicles found without a pass may be towed at the owner's expense. Car covers and wheel covers are permitted if factory made and in acceptable appearance and in good condition. Car covers must be properly secured to the vehicle, weights to hold the cover down are not allowed. Any lost or unreturned gate cards will result in a $25 replacement fee. Gate access cards are only applicable at specific locations; not all locations are gated, or require a gate card.\nQUIET HOURS\nOur quiet hours are from 11pm - 8am daily, unless otherwise dictated by on-site staff or local regulations.

During quiet hours, no loud talking, loud radios, loud televisions or other loud noises or behavior that may disturb guests is permitted. The use of generators are not permitted on the property, unless prior approval from management is granted.\nRESPECT YOUR NEIGHBOR\nPlease be considerate of your neighbors' privacy and space. Do not walk on or pass through the site of another guest. Respect our local culture, wildlife, and those around you. Please be mindful of our local bylaws and conservation of resources. We are proud to promote an inclusive and family friendly atmosphere at all our resorts. Harassment or offensive or intolerant language or actions will not be tolerated in any form, included with respect to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or political views.

Use caution when near bodies of water or natural brush, as some of the local wildlife is dangerous and should be left alone. Some of the local wildlife is protected by State Law. Feeding, killing, abusing or otherwise disturbing the wildlife is strictly prohibited. Additionally, feeding stray animals, including but not limited to cats or birds is prohibited.\nSMOKING & ALCOHOL\nThere is no smoking, including vaping, allowed in vacation or cottage rentals, resort restrooms and shower facilities, indoor facilities, common areas, or any outdoor amenities. Smoking is allowed on your own site as long as it is done so in a way that will not directly or indirectly impact the experience of other guests. Alcohol is permitted by legal drinking age adults as long as it is done so in a way that will not directly or indirectly impact the experience of other guests.

Please do not burn or leave trash in fire pits, and do not move pits without permission from the staff. All fires must be contained to the pit/ring, and are permitted only from 8am -Midnight. Never leave a fire unattended. County bans may occur and will be posted at the welcome center. Any chemicals or toxic materials must remain locked up at all times, or safely removed from the access of children or animals.\nDANGEROUS CONDITIONS\nWhile it is always our priority to allow guests the peaceful and undisturbed enjoyment of their site, in the event a resort team member believes, in their reasonable discretion, that an emergency or dangerous condition exists on a guest's site, which could potentially pose a risk of harm to any person or property, the resort team has the right to enter the guest's site and access any area or unit on the site, in order to remedy the emergency or dangerous condition, or prevent or mitigate the potential harm.\nPETS\nWe are a pet-friendly resort but pets may not disturb other guests, and must be cleaned up after by owners. Pets must always be on a leash and restrained when not confined inside an RV, and no pet may be left unattended outside of an RV, even on the site or if restrained. There is a maximum of two pets per reservation with a $100 non-refundable fee per reservation for any pet in a vacation or cottage rental. Pets are the responsibility of the owner. If management determines that a pet is disruptive or aggressive, they have sole discretion to require the guest to restrict the pet's behavior or location, or remove the pet from the resort. If a guest is unwilling or unable to restrict the pet or have it removed from the resort, as requested by management, management has the right to immediately terminate the guest's reservation and evict the guest from the resort, without refund. All pets must also be up to date on vaccines, and copies of pet vaccine records must be available upon request. Upon check-in, you are required to notify the office of your pets if you have not already added them to your reservation during the booking process.\nGARBAGE & RECYCLING\nAny household garbage and recycling are to be put in the designated areas, garbage bins and recycling receptacles located on the resort map.

Guests are responsible, and will be charged, for any damages caused by the guest's sewer hookup.\nELECTRICITY\nSite electric pedestals are owned by the resort - any guest found tampering with electrical pedestals will be removed from the resort without any refund.

Applicable fees may apply.\nSITE RELOCATION FEES\nThere will be a $250 fee for any relocation of a seasonal/annual guest to a new site.\nPRESENTATION POLICY\nAll units at the resort are required to maintain a clean well-kept appearance. Any RV's, travel trailers, or other private property that is 10 years or older will need to be inspected by a manager prior to entrance to the resort. Any unit being admitted into the resort is at the discretion of management. Any light bulb used on the exterior of the unit may only be a maximum of sixty (60) watts and must be aimed only to a portion of the site and not to any other site. Any decorations and/or lights used on the outside of the RV must be UL certified and are subject to park management's approval.\nSELLING ONSITE\n<>Selling personal property is not permitted at the resort, unless approved by the resort manager, after complying with the following procedures. Prior to selling any privately owned property, you must complete a\nResort Resale Request form\nnotifying the resort manager of your intent to sell on-site (forms can be found at the welcome center). Once a resale inquiry is received, the resort manager will perform a resale inspection to approve or deny the transfer. Not all privately owned property may qualify for on-site transfers. The resort manager will determine, in their sole discretion, if the unit qualifies for an on-site transfer based upon its condition. There is a transfer fee of $1000 due to the resort during any private sale to cover the administrative costs of the transfer system - this is not negotiable and is payable at the time of the sale; the obligation to pay the transfer fee will default to the buyer if the seller does not pay. Private sale is defined to include any sale, gift, or other transfer including devise by will. If your unit does not qualify for on-site transfer and you still decide that you will not be returning for another season, your unit must be removed along with all other personal items.\nNEATNESS POLICY\nSites and decks must always be kept neat and decks may not be used as a storage area. Only furniture intended for outdoor use may be located on sites and decks. No display of any appliances on decks or sites is permitted.

No RVs are allowed to park in driveways of any units. Boats, cargo trailers, and other similar equipment are not allowed to be parked on RV sites, unless prior approval is granted. Storage areas are available at select locations for an additional fee.

In the event the oldest occupant of a home dies or vacates the home, the remaining occupant(s) may continue as a guest(s) of the resort and an occupant of the home as long as at least 80% of the occupied homes in the resort, including that occupied by the remaining guest(s) are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. Notwithstanding this express policy and intent to the contrary, resort management reserves the right in its sole discretion to accept a new guest who is less than 55 years of age as long as at least 80% of the occupied homes, including that of the new guest, are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older and no one under the age of 35.\nOCCUPANCY AND STORAGE ARRANGEMENTS\nCertain resorts only permit guests to occupy their site for 6 or 7 months per year, and require them to vacate the community for the remaining months of the year, while allowing them to keep their RV or home on site, or may otherwise restrict a guest's stay to no more than 6 or 7 months. These arrangements are sometimes referred to as 6&6 or 7&5 arrangements. At these applicable resorts, the grandfathered 7&5 and 6&6 payment plan year begins on your move in anniversary date of each year. The 6 or 7 months of occupancy may occur between your anniversary dates of each year. Unused time may not be carried over and will not be refunded. All 7&5 and 6&6 guests MUST check in and out with the resort office each time they arrive and depart. Extended occupancy time beyond 6 or 7 months, as applicable, will be charged additional market rate.\nOCCUPANCY RESTRICTIONS\nNotwithstanding anything else in these Rules and Regulations to the contrary, all guests must comply with state and local requirements related to permitted length of stay, use restrictions and any other laws, rules, regulations or restrictions applicable to the resort.\nMISCELLANEOUS TENANT PROTECTIONS AT ORANGE CITY AND ARBOR TERRACE ONLY\nNotwithstanding anything else in these Rules and Regulations to the contrary, lease terms for the Orange City and Arbor Terrace communities shall be for one year, commencing on the date of the original lease contract date, and continuing for twelve (12) months, unless sooner terminated as provided in the Lease Agreement, and renewable at the option of the tenants unless good cause exists for nonrenewal.

Additional charges may result for sites requiring additional cleaning.\nPERMITTED OCCUPANTS\nAll reservations include a maximum of 6 guests unless otherwise stated. Rates are based on the maximum occupancy of the site. The individual reserving the site must be a minimum of 25 years of age. If younger, they must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who will be physically present for the duration of the reservation.\nVISITORS\nVisitors only permitted for seasonal sites. Campers are responsible for their visitors. Each visitor must register in advance per day.

Please remember that all amenities are on a seasonal and weather dependent schedule that may have limited hours during the spring and fall. We reserve the right to close any facilities at our discretion without prior notice. Please refer to posted rules and regulations throughout the property for additional information on our amenities. Specific locations require guests to display their property-issued wristband at all times while on site, as well as for access to amenities.\nGENERAL RULES\nQUIET HOURS\nOur quiet time is from 11 p.m. - 8 a.m. daily, but please be courteous to your fellow guests during all hours of the day. During quiet hours, there is no loud talking, loud radios, loud televisions, or other loud noises allowed. The use of generators are not permitted on the property.
