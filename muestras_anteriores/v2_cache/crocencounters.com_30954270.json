He\nis not just any ordinary alligator though; he is also the reason the organization was\nestablished in 2005. He is one of the largest alligators at the sanctuary and by far the most\nfavored by our group. We even decided to name our first son after him â JOHN AMOS!\nThis distinction is why he appears on the front of our promotional flyers. Amos was originally\nkept as a pet by a family in Ambridge, PA. After 2.5 years in a small fish tank, Amos was\nquickly outgrowing his space. That is when his owners decided to place him in the care of\nthose who could accommodate his growing needs. Amos is now over 11 feet long,\napproximately 600 pounds, and living in a spacious outdoor enclosure.\nSpike & Bertha\nSpike & Bertha are about 30 years old and are a mating pair. Spike is 10 feet and weighs more than 300 pounds and Bertha is about 8 feet in length.\nThey came to us in 2008 from Jungle Bobâs traveling exhibit where they were the highlight of high end parties and once partied with Donald Trump.\nSpike and Bertha share an enclosure at Croc Encounters and still enjoy each otherâs company after many long years of living together. Spike continues to travel for events as an animal ambassador.\nJojo\nJojo is a male American Alligator who is approximately 9 feet long. His travel from Buffalo, NY\nto Tampa in June of 2007 was a media sensation. Even though our organization takes in\nalligators all the time, from all over the country, Jojo captured the publicâs attention. His story\nwas unique.\nAt the time the average length of incoming alligators was between 2-4 feet Long, but Jojo was\nnearly 8! His owner illegally kept him as a pet in his basement in Buffalo, NY. Because of the\nownerâs compliance with the Department of Environmental Conservation in New York State, he\nwas not brought up on charges for this offense.\nJojo was not kept inhumanely, however he seems to truly enjoy being kept in a large outdoor\ndirt pond in sunny Florida. He shares this large pond with several other alligators.\nend text\nend page_amalligator\nchange # depending on which page the content is on\nend content_width\nend content\nInstanceEndEditable\nend footer_logo\nCroc Encounters is a working agritourism facility focused on\neducation and conservation efforts for crocodilians and other reptiles.\nend footer_mission\nHome\n|\nAbout Us\n|\nContact Us\n|\nDonate\n|\nVolunteer\nend footer_nav\n© 2023 Croc Encounters   |  All rights reserved  |  Created by\nJennifer Reed\nend footer_copyright\nend footer_width\nend footer_container",

While crocodilians have always been our main focus we have extended our haven to unwanted reptiles, birds, and mammals. In addition to being a sanctuary we are an educational facility open to the public for guided tours and events.\nIn the summer of 2008 Croc Encounters opened its gates for guided tours after three years of hard work and dedication.  Croc Encounters still continues to offer personal guided tours, tours for schools and groups as well as special events every day of the week.\nExciting experiences also extend beyond the facility grounds. Our education teams consisting of experienced handlers reach the community at events such as birthday parties, summer camps, school programs, library programs and more! Croc Encounters has offered educational programs, traveling exhibits and displays throughout the Greater Tampa Bay region as well as Nationwide since 2005.\nCroc Enocunters is a working agritourism facility focused on education and conservation efforts for crocodilians and other reptiles.\n<h2>About the Croc Encounters Family:</h2>\n\n<p>Croc Encounters is a family operated facility.  </p>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<table width=\"840\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5px\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"odd\"><img src=\"images/history/john.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"john\" /></td>\n<td class=\"odd\"><img src=\"images/history/karina.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"karina\" /></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td><p><b>John Paner</b>, known as <i>\"Jungle John\"</i> at Croc Encounters, is originally from Buffalo, New York.

This crocodile is the largest animal at Croc Encounters\nat over 12 feet long.\nHe has been at the sanctuary since 2005. Buc came from an education zoo in Marion County,\nFL. Initially he was placed in a large earth pond along with his brother, Seminole.\nThe two had been housed together their whole lives but after the move from the zoo, Buc\nestablished the new enclosure as his territory. He would not allow Seminole into the water and\nwould not allow him to eat. The two were separated and they have both been doing well on\ntheir own since then.\nOne of Bucâs favorite things to do is dig holes in his enclosure. He is a big boy and he has\nburrowed holes long enough for his entire body to fit completely into. Buc was moved from his\noriginal pond to a new earth pond. Since then his pond has been redone several times and he\nwas finally moved into a larger enclosure inhabited by large alligators and another crocodile.\nAfter it was determined that had become to aggressive he was moved to a concrete pond with\nthe help of Animal Planetâs Gator Boys.\nSkippy\nSkippy was a nuisance American crocodile who was given to us by Florida Fish and Wildlife after having been relocated on several locations.\tAmerican Crocodiles are found in a small population in southern Florida and Skippy originally came from Turkey Point. If you look closely at his tail scutes you can see where he was marked by FWC officials as a hatchling.\nSkippy came to us in 2008 and was approximately 7 feet in length at the time.
