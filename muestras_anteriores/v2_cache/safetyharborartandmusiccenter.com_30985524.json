They spent their lives turning their home into a work of art. They shared a magical dream of creating a place where creativity and community could blossom together.\nWith the help of their friend, Heather Richardson, a Pepsi Refresh Grant, a team of hardworking volunteers/artists/creatives, and unwavering community support, they were able to see their dream come to life.\nOur building was designed by Grant Genova and Dan Carlson. The Safety Harbor Art and Music Center (SHAMc) opened its doors in 2015 and instantly became a unique and vibrant cultural haven for art and music lovers alike. Over 290 people volunteered to help create mirror mosaics that permanently adorn the exterior of the building. SHAMc is a place where children and the children-at-heart can gather to celebrate art.\nSHAMc is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization; EIN: 45-1473112.

Safety Harbor, Florida, is a city on the west shore of Tampa Bay in Pinellas County. We're a convenient short walking distance from downtown Safety Harbor and it's main street. We're the colorful building with the giant pink elephant out in front.\nWhat are SHAMc's hours?\nOur current hours of operation for the 2024/25 season (September 19, 2024 through June 30, 2025) are Thursday and Friday from Noon to 5 pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm.\nCan I bring my dog, cat, or chicken to SHAMc?\nSorry, no pets are allowed. Only approved service animals are permitted inside of the venue.\nIs there parking at SHAMc?\nWe have limited spaces in front of SHAMc. Street parking is available except where the curbs are painted yellow. There are some city lots nearby. Do not park in the Gigglewaters parking lot adjacent to Daydreamers Cafe as you may be towed. We have one parking space for individuals who are handicapped directly in front of our building.\nIs SHAMc wheelchair accessible?\nThe SHAMc building is ADA compliant. If you are touring the SHAMc Complex, Whimzey Land and Casa Loco are offsite and have grass and mulch paths. Please contact us using the form on this page with any other questions about accessibility and we would be happy to assist.\nCan I bring my own drinks to SHAMc?\nNo, outside beverages are not allowed. We are a licensed venue, and bringing your own drinks could put our liquor license at risk. We appreciate your understanding and support in helping us stay compliant with local regulations. Enjoy our great selection at the bar instead!\nI have a large group, can I schedule a tour?\nAbsolutely! We love large groups. You can submit the form on this page to book a tour or visit the tour page on our website.\nIs there a charge for children on tours?\nChildren 4 and under are free on our tours.\nCan I add on an art project to my tour?\nYes! Please add this request when contacting us about a tour of the SHAMc Complex.\nAn event was sold out/I was waitlisted for a concert. What are my options?\nWhen a concert reaches capacity and sells out, a waitlist is enabled. If a spot opens, waitlisted individuals are notified in the order they joined.\nWe call people on the phone directly to offer these spots.\nMore than likely, if you are contacted, it will be on the day of the concert. It has also come to our attention that there is a resale market and that many of these are scams. If you're purchasing resale, do so at your own risk. We recommend that you register for the event as early as possible to avoid being waitlisted. You can learn about our upcoming concerts from our weekly email - Sign up below!\nCan I/my band play at SHAMc?\nTodd Ramquist is in charge of booking music events, and he works directly with booking agent and managers. We are a small mom-and-pop venue, but we try to bring top tier musicians and artists to our space, most of them award-winning and with a strong following. If you meet this criteria, please have your booking agent\nreach out to Todd directly\n. If you're a local musician looking to get your foot in the door, we recommend coming to our\nOpen Mic Nights\n.\nAre supplies included in the workshop I'm taking?\nYes, all supplies are included unless otherwise communicated in the class description or via email.\nI was waitlisted for a class. What does that mean?\nWhen a class reaches capacity, a waitlist is enabled. If a spot opens, waitlisted individuals are notified in the order they joined. You have 24 hours to register before the next person is contacted.\nCan I donate art supplies to SHAMc?\nYes, please\nemail us\na photo and description of the supplies you want to donate. Due to limited space, we cannot accept everything. You can view a list of needed items\nhere\n. SHAMc is a non-profit organization and, as such, all donations are tax deductible.\nAre phones allowed at Summer Camps?\nYes. We believe that phones are a part of the artistic journey. As such, we allow phones at our summer camps as long as participants use them for creative purpose. Examples of this are photography or making videos.\nCan I teach a workshop at SHAMc?\nWe are always looking for new, creative ideas to expand our offerings. To be considered, please\nfill out this form\nwith your workshop idea, description, and sample images and our Director will be in touch.\nSHAMc BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nBobbie Dusenberry\nCFO, Sahlman Seafoods\nMontiki\nCreative Director, Digital Media Solutions\nPedro Jarquin\nTeacher, Enterprise High School\nMAKE OUR ART BEAT!\nTo all our amazing SHAMc volunteers: We wouldn't be where we are today without the countless hours and unwavering dedication from each of you.
