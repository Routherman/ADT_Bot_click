      "text": "About Us\nOur Story\nChef Tina Calhoon is a Florida native – born in Jacksonville and raised in Ocala. Her maternal roots hail from the south and include many days spent in the kitchen with her mom learning the cooking basics and giving her the best kind of culinary education…a real world one. This hands-on culinary training allowed Tina to build on her southern roots to create unique, new southern dishes, as well as regional and ethnic offerings that appeal to all palates.\nTina and her husband Tim, Frescos’ Director of Spirits and Entertainment, opened the doors to Frescos in 2009 with a vision that has seen them through three restaurant expansions over the last 10 years. Frescos has gone from small bistro to downtown destination, helping to revitalize the Downtown Lakeland dining scene while paving the way for other boutique restaurants to establish themselves here.\nOur mission is to create a warm and welcoming space where exceptional hospitality, a vibrant atmosphere and unforgettable food come together to forge lasting relationships with our guests. We remain committed to serving thoughtfully crafted dishes and cocktails delivering consistent quality while cultivating a sense of belonging that connects people and strengthens our community. Every visit should feel like coming home – where great food, spirits and caring keep guests coming back.\nAbout Us\nOur Story\nChef Tina Calhoon is a Florida native – born in Jacksonville and raised in Ocala.
