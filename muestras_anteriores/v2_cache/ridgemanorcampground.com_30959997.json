      "text": "// CATEGORY NAV\nRidge Manor Campground is a 55 and older RV park located in Central Florida. We have 40 Mobile Home sites and 50 RV sites on 20 wooded acres. We have abundant wildlife including sandhill cranes, gopher tortoises, rabbits, hawks and more. We appreciate and respect the animals that live here and strive to keep our campground well maintained while also keeping it natural.\nWe are located a mile from the Withlacoochee River and Silver Lake Recreation area for canoeing and fishing. The paved Withlacoochee bike trail runs right by our park (about a mile away) that is about 46 miles long and runs through Floral City, Inverness and several other small towns. For beaches, Hernando County has Pine Island, but we are not far from Clearwater or St. Petersburg beaches. Disney is also only a 1 hour drive.\nWe have been family owned and operated for almost 30 years, and have been in business for over 40. We take pride in our campground and in everything we do. We also work in the park every day, so we are familiar with our residents, their families and everything involved with running Ridge Manor Campground. We truly care about our residents and their well being and we think that is what makes us a great place to live.\nInterested in hearing more or staying with us?\nContact us at\ninfo@ridgemanorcampground.com\nor call us at (352) 583-2737.\nWe would love to hear from you!\nNearby Silver Lake Recreation Area and Withlacoochee State Trail.\nSome of the flora & fauna that can be found at Ridge Manor Campground.",
