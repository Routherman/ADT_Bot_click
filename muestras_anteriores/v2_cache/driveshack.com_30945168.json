It could not have went any better! Kenzie was our point of contact and the process was a breeze. We will be holding many more events here going forward.\nLandon Heath, Google Reviews\nAs a past platinum member of Topgolf, I’m choosing Drive Shack Richmond any day! They support the community with local events, and the culture is genuine unlike the other golf places.\nTraven Carter, Google Reviews\nGreat family atmosphere to celebrate a birthday with kids and grandkids! Sarah Davidson made the event so special! Looking forward to the next time.\nGeorge Norrington, Google Reviews\nTEE UP THE MOMENT\nWith the perfect venue, gameplay, food, and drink, we’ll make your event a hole-in-one!\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhat is the difference between an online reservation and an event?\nOur online reservation system is available for groups of 1-6 guests to book a single-bay. The reservation allows them to be moved to the top of the waitlist and sat in the first available single-bay upon arrival at their selected reservation time.\nBy booking an event, we ensure that the appropriate number of bays are reserved together and fully prepared in advance for your group. This allows us to allocate the necessary staff to provide efficient speed of service, creating a smoother and more enjoyable experience for all participants. This is the only way we guarantee multiple bays side-by-side. Walk-ins are always welcome during regular business hours, however, depending on availability, your bays will not be placed together.\nDoes booking an event guarantee my bays side-by-side?\nAbsolutely! When you book an event, we make sure to reserve the appropriate number of bays together to accommodate your entire group, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the experience together.\nWhat is the maximum number of guests per bay?\nA single bay comfortably accommodates up to 6 guests, whether they’re actively golfing or not. This ensures there’s enough space for everyone to enjoy the experience (whether they’re participating in the game or simply socializing) and helps manage safety with capacity levels.\nHow do you accommodate guests that are attending our event but don’t plan on golfing?\nGuests often say they’re not planning on golfing, but don’t count them out–many end up giving it a try and having a great time! That said, we still have to account for all guests in your final headcount, as even non-golfers are taking up space in the bays. This helps us ensure we have the right amount of space, seating, and staffing to make sure everyone has a great time–whether they’re golfing or just socializing!\nWhat is included in Drive Shack’s event packages?\nDrive Shack event packages include reserved bays, your choice of catered menu, alcoholic beverages (optional), dedicated staff, entertainment, and customizable add-ons to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for your group\nDo you allow outside food and beverage?\nThe only outside food and/or beverage we allow is a store purchased cake with the ingredients list on the packaging. Our venue offers a variety of food and drink options available through our bays, on-site restaurant or bar, which are part of our event packages and regular guest experience.\nShould you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to\ndriveshackevents@driveshack.com.",
