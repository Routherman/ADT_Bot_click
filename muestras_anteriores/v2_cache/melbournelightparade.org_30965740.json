Sit back and enjoy the wonders of the Melbourne area as we bring the hometown feeling of Christmas to you. There will be locally made and designed floats from girls scout and boy scout groups, local businesses, churches, and other local community groups. We will have bands, ROTC groups, dance teams and much more. Oh and don't forget Santa. He will be arriving on a 55ft float with Mrs. Claus and their beautiful reindeer.\nThe Melbourne Light Parade has been a family tradition bringing delight to children and families for over 30 years. The floats and performances celebrate the things we love about our city and showcases local businesses, schools, and non-profit organizations.\nHere are some amazing facts about The Melbourne Light Parade:\nT\nhe purpose of the parade is to help those who are less fortunate by collecting and distributing thousands of pounds of food, new toys, and pet food to local food pantries and Space Coast Kibble Kitchen.\nIt is a 501 c 3 Not-for-Profit charity\nThere are no paid staff members. The Melbourne Light Parade is completely organized and run by a handful of dedicated volunteers.\nHere is another fact:\nParades are expensive. Costs include but are not limited to; liability insurance, traffic and crowd control, barricades, traffic signage, advertising, rental equipment, and contract labor.\nWe need corporate and private monetary sponsors.\nLocation\nMelbourne Light Parade\n912 E.
