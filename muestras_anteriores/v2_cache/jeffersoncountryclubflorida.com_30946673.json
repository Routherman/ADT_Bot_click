Our tennis courts and swimming pool are for members only, and because we are a semi-private club, we require residents of Jefferson County to hold a membership in order to play. Those residing outside of the county are able to play as often as they'd like at our standard guest rates. Tee times are recommended but not required; please call us at 850-997-5484.\nOur bar area is open during normal club hours with snacks and drinks available on the go.\nDavid Jackson, Golf Pro\nDavid is a life long member of Jefferson Country Club who grew up roaming the fairways and was named to Golf Magazine's Junior All American Team.

David then played professionally for 10 years, including two years on the PGA Tour and eight years on the Hogan/Nike Tour where he won the 1992 Cleveland Open.\nIn his years of teaching golf, David has helped players at all skill levels improve their game and his success stories include five collegiate golfers including the 2023 Women's PGA Champion, Megan Schofield.\nPlease contact David at 850-528-0025 for more information on improving your game.\nRichard McKee, Tennis Pro\nRichard is the former men's tennis coach at Presbyterian College in Clinton, SC and Florida State University in Tallahassee and has taught since his own graduation from the University of North Carolina in 1974.
