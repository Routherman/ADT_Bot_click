Legend has it that Mr. Urbanek had emigrated from Cuba in a Cuban Navy Boat, which he used as his fishing vessel to supply his burgeoning fish market with product. Urbanek's Fish Market was a local favorite and supplied many restaurants in the Nokomis area.\nAt some point, another restaurant was built on the adjoining land and they operated independently in a peaceful coexistence for many years. Over the years, the restaurant went through several iterations:\nSilver Shark - featuring sharks in a fish tank near the outside bar\nBuoy Bar - a biker bar with pool tables\nBritt’s Place - a fine dining establishment\nPop’s Tropigrille - the sign formerly in the parking lot and now in Pop's Tiki proves this chapter\nIn 2001, the current ownership group purchased both Pop’s Tropigrille and Urbanek’s Fish Market and merged them to form one restaurant known as Pop’s Sunset Grill, keeping the favorite menu items of both. We have focused on maintaining the Old Florida charm while updating and enhancing the property.\nInstallation of five fire pit tables and redesigned landscape in Pop’s Courtyard\nComplete renovation of the main building\nIndoor Bar and adjacent dining area\nExpanded & Modernized Restrooms\nFull Commercial Kitchen remodel\nPop’s Tiki Bar and Bou-Tiki opened in January, 2019\nPop’s Sunset Grill is a one-of-a-kind destination and we intend to sustain the unique character for the foreseeable future.

We are committed to provide quality meals and beverages, served in a casual, friendly, inviting and welcoming tradition of hospitality.\nWhat’s in a Name?\nWe’ve been asked many times over the years, “Who is Pop?” Most expect Pop to be one of the owners or a local beer drinking legend or even baseball hall of famer Willie Stargell.\nIn actuality, Pop is not a person, it’s a sound. If you stand on the dock in the evening and watch the snook eat under the lights you’ll hear a distinctive sound when they break the surface of the water in an attempt to catch their prey.  Pop’s Sunset Grill gets its name from this distinctive “Pop”.\nThe \"Reel\" POP Story - A True Fish Tale\nBy Frank McAndrew & Jeannie Bloomfield\n\"ARE YOU POP?\"\nthey ask the old man in the shop.\nThe old man smiles in his reply;\na knowing look, and then a sigh ...\n\"You can call me POP, of this gift shop.\nBut if you’ve got a minute, stop\nto hear the real, true tale of POP.\"\nIt goes this way,\nthe locals say...\nThere once was a fish named POP,\nwho didn't know when to stop.\nHe was a smart snook\nthat avoided the hook.\n'Cause naught!\nPOP couldn't be caught!\nWhile looking for treasure\nto eat for his pleasure,\nPOP swam to the Alley\nand begged from the galley.\nSo the cooks in good mood\nthrew POP some great food,\nWhich POP ate like a pig,\nand he got really big!\n'Cause naught!\nPOP couldn't be caught!\nIt goes by the book,\nthis snook beat the hook!\nIt's a fish-tail that's truly a thrill.\n'Cause from this fish story\ncame all of POP’s glory...\nThat's how it got named\n\"POP's Grill\"!\nTHE END of this big fish tale.\nSlide 1 of 10\nSlide 2 of 10\nSlide 3 of 10\nSlide 4 of 10\nSlide 5 of 10\nSlide 6 of 10\nSlide 7 of 10\nSlide 8 of 10\nSlide 9 of 10\nSlide 10 of 10\nAbout\nScroll Down to Content\nSlide 1 of 4\nSlide 2 of 4\nSlide 3 of 4\nSlide 4 of 4\nPop's Story\nThe story of Pop’s Sunset Grill began in the 1940’s when Urbanek’s Fish Camp first settled on the plot of land currently occupied by Pop’s Tiki.
