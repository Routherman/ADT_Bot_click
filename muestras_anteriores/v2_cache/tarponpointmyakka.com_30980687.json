Going back to the early 50’s when it was\nBecky’s Bait & Tackle, then a marina and campground, that ultimately morphed to include a restaurant. In the mid-1990’s, ownership decided to focus solely on operating a successful restaurant, and the marina was closed. It has been operating as a restaurant ever since.\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nWhen you arrive, you will see the tiki hut appearance and overall décor, putting you in that Jimmy Buffet mindset quickly ~ it’s 5 O’clock somewhere, and you’ll be ready for an ice-cold beer or one of our signature cocktails. We schedule live entertainment regularly, consistent with our waterfront-island beach feel. So, kick-back, snack on our fresh oysters, join in on one of our famous monthly themed costume events or listen to live music while watching the sun set on the Myakka River.\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nIn this latest evolution, we have remodeled and upgraded the facility and premises to reflect our goal of creating a fun and relaxing waterfront environment, where guests can enjoy the freshest and tastiest dishes possible, with an emphasis of course on seafood. We strive to source all ingredients locally, both to support local providers and to obtain the freshest food possible.\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nIf you’re lucky, while you’re enjoying that amazing view - you might just catch a manatee sighting, and\nno shortage of gators roaming about as we’re located where the river is still brackish. In fact, the name,\nTarpon Point, derives from an actual geographic reference, just a touch south of our location (but well\nwithin view), which is considered the northernmost point where tarpon will swim in the river.\nOh, and we look forward to helping you coordinate your next group event. We have plenty of space,\nwhether you want to do it inside or outside, and have numerous options to accommodate your party’s\npreferences and your budget. So please consider us for your next work event, wedding rehearsal\ndinner, birthday celebration or simply all your friends and family!
