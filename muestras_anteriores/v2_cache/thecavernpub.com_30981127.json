More time is available but the minimum purchase requirement increases.\nMonday thru Thursday has a $500 minimum purchase requirement (add $125 per hour after 4 hours) and $1,000 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday (add $250 per hour after 4 hours). Minimums do not include sales tax or tips.\nWe can run one tab or keep everyone separate, it's up to you. We can also manage tickets if you want to buy the first beverage for everyone. You'll need to give the tickets out in advance or have someone at the door.\nIf you drop off decorations, we'll be happy to put them up or you can do it yourself just before the event. Removing them will be your responsibility.\nWe'll provide bartenders according to the number of guests.\nFood is available - see the Food Menu Tab above, restrictions apply depending on the number of guests. We can prepare a custom menu, let's talk about it. You may provide the food but the same minimum purchase requirements must be met.\nA $200 cash deposit is required to hold the date. It is refundable if canceled more than 2 weeks from date, non-refundable within 2 weeks. Cash is required because we'll either apply $200 as cash to your tab or refund cash the night of your event. We can also accept Venmo, or Zelle.\n49 person capacity.\nCall Gail 904-559-9942\nCopyright © 2019 The Cavern - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by\nHome\nDraft Menu\nAbout\nContact us\nEvent Calendar",
