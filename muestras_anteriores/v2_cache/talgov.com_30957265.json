The Board is a seven-member body appointed by the City Commission, Florida A&M University, Florida State University, State Prosecutor's Office, Public Defender's Office, and two selected at large. Staff for the Ethics Office includes an executive director/ethics officer and administrative specialist. The Board contracts with a legal advisor. Their functions are outlined in the Tallahassee Ordinance under the provisions of the Ethics Code.\nThe Board oversees ethics training for City officials, appointees, employees, and advisory board members. As a quasi-judicial Board, they hear cases of alleged violations of the Ethics Code. The Board has subpoena power and investigates the alleged violations in circumstances where it has jurisdiction.

The fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30.\nThree-Year Strategic Plan\n2024/2025 through 2026/2027\n2022/2023 through 2024/2025\n2021/2022 through 2023/2024\n2020/2021 through 2022/2023\nAnnual Reports\nWe are proud to present these reports and share our achievements and the direction that the Board is taking.

      "text": "About the City Commission\nMission:\nTo be the national leader in the delivery of public service.\nVision:\nA creative capital city that supports a strong community with vibrant neighborhoods; an innovative economic and educational hub serving diverse and passionate people, protecting our natural resources and preserving our unique character.\nValues:\nHonor public trust through ethical behavior.\nProvide exceptional citizen service.\nLead with integrity at every level.\nCollaborate to reach common goals.\nInvest in employee excellence.\nPromote equity and celebrate diversity.\nMayor and City Commission\nThe mayor and city commission serve as the governing body of the City; they set policies and rules by which the City is operated, including establishing City goals and target issues, as well as setting City tax rates. The mayor and city commissioners each serve four-year terms. The terms of office are staggered, with elections held in even-numbered years (two seats during Presidential election cycles, and two others - plus the mayor - in mid-term election cycles). The mayor is considered to be a \"leadership mayor\", whose role includes presiding at city commission meetings, serving as the ceremonial head of the government, serving as the official head of the City for civil processes, and executing legal documents. The mayor is also considered the political leader of the government and is involved in dialogues and negotiations with county, state, and federal officials. Tallahassee's mayor is not considered a \"strong mayor\" because the position has no veto power and represents only one vote on the city commission.\nRegular city commission meetings are typically held twice a month to conduct city business and provide citizens with an opportunity to participate in the government process. In addition, the commission meets for workshops on specific issues.

The mayor and city commissioners each serve four-year terms. The terms of office are staggered, with elections held in even-numbered years (two seats during Presidential election cycles, and two others - plus the mayor - in mid-term election cycles). The mayor is considered to be a \"leadership mayor\", whose role includes presiding at city commission meetings, serving as the ceremonial head of the government, serving as the official head of the City for civil processes, and executing legal documents. The mayor is also considered the political leader of the government and is involved in dialogues and negotiations with county, state, and federal officials. Tallahassee's mayor is not considered a \"strong mayor\" because the position has no veto power and represents only one vote on the city commission.\nRegular city commission meetings are typically held twice a month to conduct city business and provide citizens with an opportunity to participate in the government process. In addition, the commission meets for workshops on specific issues.
