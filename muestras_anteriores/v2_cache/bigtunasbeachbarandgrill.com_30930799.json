It was amazing. She was a great waitress & super friendly. Can't wait to go back and try some food. The drink is half full depending on how you look at it!\nKaren\nHave been there three times since our visit to Daytona. Super friendly staff and great food and drinks.\nBrian Woy Sr\nWe ate here twice during our two week stay in Daytona Beach. The food was excellent! The wait staff were friendly and helpful. The Mac Daddy Lobsta was delicious! We will definitely be eating at Big Tuna's anytime we're in the area.
