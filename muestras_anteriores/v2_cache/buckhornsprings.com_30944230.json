After several years of planning and carefully selecting a site, the final location was selected in February of 1966. The site was chosen for its beauty and natural features, which include natural springs and an elevation as high as 90 feet above sea level (the highest point in Hillsborough County). The grove and pastures were purchased from the Mulrennen family, Frank Emerin Jr., William Smith, and John A. Brandywie. Some of the owners even held original land grants from the president of the United States.\nDesigned by Harris Green\n<h4>In fact, Buckhorn is the oldeBrandon / Valrico area.</h4>\n<p>Our standard membership, which gives full access to our course, clubhouse\namenities, and events throughout the year.</p>\nSince opening, the course has developed into a welcoming club with many active members. Buckhorn Springs Golf & Country Club features 18 challenging holes, active men’s and women’s associations, a fully-stocked golf shop, and the best “blue tee” game in the Tampa Bay area.\nSchedule A Tour\nIn 2011, Buckhorn Springs Golf & Country Club was purchased by Brandon local and longtime member, William H. Harper.\n<h4>In fact, Buckhorn is the oldeBrandon / Valrico area.</h4>\n<p>Our standard membership, which gives full access to our course, clubhouse\namenities, and events throughout the year.</p>\nAn ultra-successful businessman, Bill Harper has established numerous businesses over the years, and is currently involved in six different companies he and his son, Steve, have started.
