      "text": "THE O'BRICKS STORY\nA LITTLE BIT O' HISTORY\nOur bar and restaurant are housed in two of downtown Bradenton's oldest structures - and the history and spirit of our buildings inspires us every day.\nWith a such a beautiful modern interior, it's hard to believe that the two buildings occupied by O'bricks actually date back to the turn of the century.  The Bar at O'bricks occupies space in the old Juplinor Hotel, and the adjoining Restaurant reside in the Anderson-Finkham Building, which since its construction in 1901 has undergone several renovations.\nO'bricks was carefully crafted to pay homage to downtown Bradenton's charm and heritage, with a nod to the tropics, too.  All of the wood (doors, tables, accents) you see\nwas personally selected by our team and hand-carved in Costa Rica.  This blend of modern, exotic, and historic reflects the unique cosmopolitan feel of O'bricks, Bradenton's favorite gathering place.\nour head honchos\nO'BRICKS OWNERSHIP\nMike Carter and Rick Willats are proud partners in O'bricks.  Together this dynamic duo has a long history of excellence in the service industry.  Mike, in particular, has a passion for the area's history as well as the Costa Rican culture, so you'll notice his influence in the atmosphere.  Rick has decades of experience in the restaurant business and brings that expertise to the O'bricks menu and team.  You'll probably see one of them on your next visit - be sure to say hi!\nmeet our\nBACK OF HOUSE MANAGEMENT\nOur Back of House is run by our strong management team made up of  John , Ceasar , David and Steve.
