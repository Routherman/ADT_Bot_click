Hope to be back next time in Miami.\nRicardo Efraín González Torres\nIt is a very beautiful, fun place, you can do different outdoor activities, the place is wonderful to spend a different day.\nMoe\nAwesome mountain biking trails for this area. I really didn’t think id find anything decent but I had a great time and the rest of the park is also gorgeous and a vibe!\nJason C\nWhat an amazing time we had. From the staff at the desks to the kayaking it was awesome. We got to see 3 manatee on our way to Raccoon Island which was an added bonus. Even we got to the island we didn’t see any raccoons but it was noisy. We walked into the island a little bit and we had 5 come up to us and we fed them. One actually stole my bag of treats and took out his own treat and left the bag. Later on we were in the water and turned around and one of the little guys from earlier was going through our kayak looking for more food lol. It is really an awesome time. Great for kids and family.\nJanean wagner\nMy husband and I rented single kayaks for enjoying a paddle in the park and to sand spur island to meet the friendly raccoons. It did not disappoint. The paddle is a definite workout especially across the bay but worth every drop of sweat to meet the friendly masked bandits. They loved the red grapes and bananas (they seemed the favorites). The paddle back to the launch wasn’t near as bad. The staff was very friendly and super helpful with all my questions, not to mention amazing customer service. 10/10 would recommend to anyone wanting a fun paddle in the Miami area.\nJulia Stutzman\nOleta River Adventures and State Park is a refreshing little piece of quiet nature nestled in the middle of concrete chaos. The staff are friendly, kind and accommodating. Our entire kayakiing experience from start to finish was enjoyable. Honestly, the patient staff members were awesome!\nSimon Dayan\nA friend and I did the two hour long kayaking tour and it was a great activity to spend a beautiful morning on the water. Our tour guide was very informative and fun and showed her love and passion for nature.

Hope to be back next time in Miami.\nRicardo Efraín González Torres\nIt is a very beautiful, fun place, you can do different outdoor activities, the place is wonderful to spend a different day.\nMoe\nAwesome mountain biking trails for this area. I really didn’t think id find anything decent but I had a great time and the rest of the park is also gorgeous and a vibe!\nJason C\nWhat an amazing time we had. From the staff at the desks to the kayaking it was awesome. We got to see 3 manatee on our way to Raccoon Island which was an added bonus. Even we got to the island we didn’t see any raccoons but it was noisy. We walked into the island a little bit and we had 5 come up to us and we fed them. One actually stole my bag of treats and took out his own treat and left the bag. Later on we were in the water and turned around and one of the little guys from earlier was going through our kayak looking for more food lol. It is really an awesome time. Great for kids and family.\nJanean wagner\nMy husband and I rented single kayaks for enjoying a paddle in the park and to sand spur island to meet the friendly raccoons. It did not disappoint. The paddle is a definite workout especially across the bay but worth every drop of sweat to meet the friendly masked bandits. They loved the red grapes and bananas (they seemed the favorites). The paddle back to the launch wasn’t near as bad. The staff was very friendly and super helpful with all my questions, not to mention amazing customer service. 10/10 would recommend to anyone wanting a fun paddle in the Miami area.\nJulia Stutzman\nOleta River Adventures and State Park is a refreshing little piece of quiet nature nestled in the middle of concrete chaos. The staff are friendly, kind and accommodating. Our entire kayakiing experience from start to finish was enjoyable. Honestly, the patient staff members were awesome!\nSimon Dayan\nA friend and I did the two hour long kayaking tour and it was a great activity to spend a beautiful morning on the water. Our tour guide was very informative and fun and showed her love and passion for nature.
