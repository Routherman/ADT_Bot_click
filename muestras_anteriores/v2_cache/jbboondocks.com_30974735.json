Since refurbishing JB Boondocks Bar & Grill located in Howey-in-the-Hills, the restaurant has become a favorite gathering place for both locals and visitors alike.\nJB Boondocks is located directly on Little Lake Harris in Howey in the Hills. Want to come by boat? JB Boondocks boasts more than 20 boat slips, you can even park your seaplane. So come and enjoy our outdoor or indoor dining, entertainment and more.\nIt’s always been my dream to offer our visitors, friends and family a place to gather in friendship with great food, a relaxing atmosphere and a beautiful view.\nMama “B”\nFounder\n.container\n.site-content\nid wrapper closed\nCopyright ©\n2025\nJB Boondocks\nBar and Grill -- Howey in the Hills, FL\nSite global modals",
