      "text": "About\nTradeWinds Italian Restaurant has been a part of the Niceville community since 1996!\nTom D’Eufemia laid the groundwork back in 1996 when he purchased the existing “TradeWinds Restaurant.” The original restaurant served pizza & sandwiches and sold home beer brewer’s supply. Tom’s passion for food, wine and socializing snowballed over the years into what TradeWinds Restaurant is today. With Tom’s passing in 2014 we were all left with a void that would never be filled. The team at TradeWinds continued Tom’s legacy and the restaurant has continued to thrive and serve the community we all love. Thank you to all of our wonderful costumers who have supported TradeWinds, some for as long as 20 years and to all of our new customers excited to discover TradeWinds delicious food and funky atmosphere. We are now seeing the third generation coming into TradeWinds! We look forward to many more years to come! Thank you all for your continued support. Without you, we could not succed! Warm Regards – The TradeWinds Family\nThank you all for your support. Without you, we could not succeed!\nWarm Regards-\nThe TradeWinds Family\nWhy TradeWinds?\nFresh Ingredients\nDelicious Food\nFriendly Staff\nGreat Atmosphere\n205 Government Ave, Niceville, FL 32578",
