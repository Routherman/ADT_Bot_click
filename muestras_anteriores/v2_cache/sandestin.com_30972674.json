Went to the beach club and enjoyed the beach front view. It was my girlfriend an I first time in Destin and would definitely go back. I will be going back.\"\nTimothy R.\nExcellent!\n\"We want to move to Florida now because of how great of a time we had! The Sandestin Resort was phenomenal! Go to the beach for a while, then the pool or kayaking and then enjoy the family friendly nightlife in the Baytowne Warf! It was all perfect! We cannot wait to get back to Destin for more fun!\"\nB. Taylor\nFamily trip to Sandestin\n\"I recently had the pleasure to stay at the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort. The amenities the resort offers are second to none. The amount of food options, activities for the kids and overall fun experiences for the whole family are plentiful. We stayed in a 4 bedroom unit at Villa Lago on property and the unit was amazing. I highly recommend this property if you’re looking for a family friendly place that has it all. Can’t say enough about the property, it’s staff and amenities!!\"\nTripAdvisor Guest\nAmazing getaway!\n\"This place is amazing. The view from our balcony over the Bay was such a beautiful sight at night. The room was very spacious. We're got in late so we didn't get to take advantage of all that this place has to offer but we will definitely be back for a longer stay.\"\nTripAdvisor Guest\nAwesome Resort and Tennis\n\"The Sandestin Resort is awesome! There are plenty of housing options that are safe, clean, spacious, nicely appointed and very convenient to everything! The tennis facility and staff are great! The staff conducts excellent drills and round robins that are state of the art instruction and appropriate for any playing level. Absolutely awesome tennis experience on well maintained clay courts!\"\nLavonne W.\nBest Family Vacay\n\"Our family has had the best experience at Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort. A beautiful resort and great staff - A big thank you to Brock Ellis for being so helpful and wonderful!!\"\nHunter and Molly Warren",

I have eight rental properties under their management. Managing my diversified portfolio of properties has not been an easy task. My rental income over the years has steadily increased, as has the quality of property improvements.\"\nDr. Wildstein, (LaSata Penthouse, LeJardin, Grand Sandestin (Four Units), and Luau (Two Units)\nWe Love Everything About It\n\"We had some apprehension about purchasing a condo as a second home, but the Rental Sales Team put our minds to ease with their energy and enthusiasm. Our Rental Manager has blown us away with her amazing service. She always makes us feel like we are her top priority and has given us a tremendous piece of mind, knowing our condo is in great hands with your program. We love everything about the Sandestin Rental Program and know we made the perfect choice to join your first-class program!\"\nB. & L. Foster (Crystal Cove)\nMy Investment is in Good Hands\n\"I have used Sandestin Rental Management for multiple units for many years. As an out-of-town owner, they make the process easy and keep a close eye on things in my absence. Different areas of the organization have come to my aid over the years for different needs. Sales helped me evaluate the rental prospects for new units, engineering helped me coordinate emergency repairs with contractors and my insurance company, and housekeeping even helped locate a dining room chair that went missing. Each department works with a true sense of professionalism.\"\nC. Rucci (Luau and Tivoli)\nExceeds My Standards\n\"We recently moved from Observation Point to LaSata into a unit that needed substantial renovation. No surface was left untouched. We used the recommended vendors and they did awesome work. A number of times we needed nearly immediate assistance from both Housekeeping and Engineering. They came through with flying colors. Glenn and his housekeeping team and the engineering team deserve the highest accolades. Lee, of course stayed on top of everything. I have 35 years in the service industry, and I have very high standards. The whole SDI team exceeds my standards. I am happy I stayed with Sandestin Rentals.\"\nM. Rhoney (Lasata)\nHighly Recommend Them\n\"My husband and I purchased 2 condos in the Sandestin Resort. The first one we bought was with another rental company. A month later we decided to buy the other one and it was already with Sandestin Rental Co. After talking to both companies, comparing numbers and going over all pros and cons, we knew Sandestin was the best for us. We have been nothing but pleased with Nadia and the Sandestin family. I highly recommend them to anyone wondering if they should change rental companies. We look forward to working with them for years to come.\"\nJ. McMillon (Grand Sandestin)\nOutstanding Service\n\"We have rented through the Sandestin rental management office since our condo was built in 1984 and we added a second condo to the program this year. The service provided is outstanding.  We are very pleased and know our units are being taken care of without worry. They are professional and straightforward, and do all they can to keep us informed and answer our questions. Our units are important to us—as we love coming to Sandestin. Thank you for all you and your staff do for us.\"\nJ. Stieglitz (Beachside Towers)",
