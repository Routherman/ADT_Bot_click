With newly-renovated courses, premier practice facilities, and cutting edge golf technology, members can expect an enriching golf experience.\nBEYOND THE COURSE\nThe 23,000 square foot clubhouse includes an exemplary restaurant run by one of the top chefs in the South, an upscale bar, an extended porch overlooking the course as well as 8 TrackMan bays, a PuttView 10, pro shop, a private dining room and more.\nCelebrating History\nKillearn Country Club & Inn is now reimagined into the Killearn Club, honoring its 50-year legacy and Tallahassee roots. David Cummings, entrepreneur, golf enthusiast, and Tallahassee native, spearheaded the multimillion-dollar reimagination. With the redesigned 18-hole Championship Course, new 9-hole Clover course, revamped facilities including a clubhouse, pool, and restaurant, members can expect the Killearn experience to be better than ever.\nWith award-winning golf architect Chris Wilczynski at the helm, the enhancements are visible with redesigned landscapes and lush turfgrass, promising an exceptional golfing experience amidst the picturesque Red Hills scenery. Memories of past gatherings inspired us to create an unsurpassed social hub in Tallahassee, drawing both old and new members to the Killearn Club.\nKillearn Club\n1 Killearn Club Way\nTallahassee, FL 32309\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nGolf Pro Shop\n1-850-270-1619\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nMembership\n1-850-270-3359\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nEmail:\n[email protected]\nTHis is one item with icon and text\nFollow Us!\n!
