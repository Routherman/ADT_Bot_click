We believe a sense of wonder is an integral part of every memorable dining experience in our space.\nEnjoy a local, hand-selected Porterhouse or Ribeye perfectly dry-aged on-site. Taste fresh raw or roasted oysters from New England and Canada. Choose a unique steak knife that reflects your personality. Quench your thirst for originality with a personalized Prime & Pearl Bourbon or Whiskey. At Prime and Pearl, nothing is ordinary.\nOUR BEEF\nAt Prime & Pearl, it is paramount that we work with professionals whose top priorities are ensuring the well-being and quality of the cattle, encouraging biodiversity in the landscape and safeguarding natural habitats. In other words, we’re more than a little choosey when it comes to our beef.\nOur journey to find the ideal herd led us to the open plains of western Nebraska, where the ranchers raise cattle with limited human interaction and all-natural feed. When the health of the animal is of the utmost importance, you get the highest-quality, best-tasting beef. And that pairs perfectly with our aim to serve you the finest cuts you’ve ever enjoyed.\nArtwork in the header of this page is “Love Story” by Michelle McDowell-Smith.
