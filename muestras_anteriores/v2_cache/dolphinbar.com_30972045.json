We share in an appreciation for great service, as well as great experiences. Enjoy our beautiful panoramic waterfront views and make sure to check out the history of our location in our display area. It’s something we honor and cherish.\nFrances Langford circa 1946\nThe Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House location is intrinsically unique, as it sits over-hanging the river’s edge. This special touch came when it was built by the famous historic movie star, Frances Langford. With such an appropriate placement, it gives it’s customers the most spectacular panoramic views. These exceptional views span from the Stuart Causeway all the way up the river to the Jensen Beach Causeway Bridge. Incorporate the restaurant’s superb location with The Dolphin’s signature dish, The Dolphin a la Dolphin, and it is easy to feel the impact of these surroundings.\nImagine this… A filet of the freshest locally caught Dolphin, sautéed in flour and egg to a beautiful light brown glaze, flavored with dry white wine, butter, lemon, capers, and fresh herbs, sitting in front of you. It’s savory odors captivate you as you take in the relaxing riverfront ambiance. It’s fantastic! And that dish is just one snippet of the many sumptuous treats offered at The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House.\nFrances Langford’s love of the Polynesian Islands, a place she visited while she entertained America’s fighting forces in the Pacific theatre during WWII, inspired her to build the Outrigger Restaurant and Resort in the 1960’s. During WWII, Lt. Frederic M. Ayres Jr. was among those men and women whom she had charmed. He had captained a US Navy Sub Chaser and was the father of The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House’s founder, Fred Ayres. Fred Ayres visited The Outrigger with his father in the 1960’s while the resort was in it’s prime. When Ayres saw the once magnificent Outrigger in a state of disrepair in the 1990’s, he knew the historic structure still held the warmth that Frances Langford had instilled in it. And it was with Frances Langford Stuart’s help and well wishes that the building, that had once held the exotic Outrigger and it’s famous patrons, was refurbished and restored. While gratitude towards Frances for her help and the historic past she bestowed upon these premises will never fade, The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House is a house built on the foundation of exquisite food and fine and happy times.\nFrances Langford had celebrated special occasions, family birthdays, and the Christmas Holidays at The Dolphin. She was among the first customers to be greeted at the door by owner Fred Ayres on The Dolphin’s opening night.Her kindness and grace will never be forgotten. But Frances loved good food and she loved to have fun – and it will be great food and good times that carry forward in the spirit of The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House, as they will in the spirit of Frances Langford Stuart.\nFor her warmth and the celebration of such friends as Bob Hope, who graced this house as Frances’s guests, we say “Thanks for the Memories”. For the wisdom and quiet generosity with which Frances enriched our community, we say “Thank you very much”! And for the soldiers and seamen and seawomen whose days were brightened as they fought a nightmarish war, we say to Frances, “God Bless You”. But Frances was a person who looked forward in a spirit of optimism and the enjoyment of life, and in her honor we raise our glasses to good food and good times, past and future. And we say “Cheers”!!!\nRow Backgrounds\nCONTACT\n1401 NE Indian River Dr\nJensen Beach, FL 34957\n27°13’21.9″N – 80°12’35.2″W\n(772) 781-5136\ndolphinwebmail@dolphinbar.com\nHOURS\nMon-Thu: 11:30am-11:00pm\nFri & Sat: 11:30am-11:00pm\nSunday: 10:00am-11:00pm\nBY SEA\n27°13’21.9″N – 80°12’35.2″W\nComing from the North:\nafter Channel Marker 223\nComing from the South:\nafter Channel Marker 224\n© 2025 Main Street Media 360.

We’ll treat you with respect.\nOur managers don’t believe in yelling or any form of hostility. We will make your responsibilities clear and if you fail to meet them you will be held accountable, but never in a way that demeans or belittles you. We believe that consistent lines of accountability are the key to a well managed, but never hostile work environment.\n2. We want to see you accomplish your goals and we’ll do whatever we can to help you.\nWe understand that working for us may only be a chapter of your life and that your career aspirations may be outside of our organization. We embrace these challenges and we want to help you get there! We’ll work with your school schedule, help you build necessary skills, write reference letters and whatever else we can do to help!\n3. We’ll work with your schedule.\nEverybody’s lives are complicated and we understand that. Some of you have families, school or maybe another job etc. Whenever possible, we do what we can to work with you.\n4. We offer health, dental and vision benefits to all employees averaging over 25 hours per week.\nEmployer contributions vary depending on your position and plan participation but we do offer more options and contribute more than most employers.\n5. We nurture a positive work culture.\nWork may be called “work”, but we don’t believe it actually has to feel that way. We are firm believers that a happy staff that’s having fun on the job will be far more likely to take great care of our guests and each other. To do this our managers place a great deal of emphasis on hiring responsible people with great attitudes. And just as important, we won’t let a bad apple poison that culture. If somebody finds them self as the common denominator in multiple instances of drama and conflict, they won’t last in our organization.\n6. We like to have fun!\nIt’s not uncommon for us to sanction a group activity or a company party. We work hard together sometimes we have to play together too!\n7. We pay competitive rates.\nWe’re not afraid to pay you what you are worth as long as you’re comfortable demonstrating you’re worth it.\n8. We’ll give you honest feedback.\nWe’ll let you know where you stand. We’ll let you know your strengths, weakness and what you need to do to get the raise or promotion you might be seeking.\nName\nPersonal Information:\nFirst Name\n*\nEmail Address\n*\nLast Name\n*\nBirth Date\n*\nPhone Number\n*\nAre You a U.S. Citizen?\n*\nSelect one\nYes\nNo\nStreet Address\n*\nState\n*\nCity\n*\nZip Code\n*\nEmployment Desired:\nPosition Applying For\n*\nHave You Worked Here Before?\nYes\nNo\nDate You Can Start\n*\nHave You Applied Here Before?\nYes\nNo\nSalary Desired\nEducation:\nEducational Institution\nArea of Study/Degree\nNumber of Years Attended\nGraduated?\nYes\nNo\nSkills/Qualifications:\nSkills\nQualifications\nCurrent Employment:\nCurrent Employer\nSalary\nStart Date\nPosition\nReason for Leaving?\nMay We Contact?\nYes\nNo\nPrevious Employment:\nPrevious Employer\nSalary\nStart Date\nPosition\nReason for Leaving?\nEnd Date\nPrevious Employment:\nPrevious Employer\nSalary\nStart Date\nPosition\nReason for Leaving?\nEnd Date\nReferences:\nReference 1\nPhone\nRelationship\nEmail\nYears Acquainted\nReference 2\nPhone\nRelationship\nEmail\nYears Acquainted\nReference 3\nPhone\nRelationship\nEmail\nYears Acquainted\nResume Upload:\nSend Application:\nBy clicking the submit button below, I certify that all of the information provided by me on this application is true and complete, and I understand that if any false information, ommissions, or misrepresentations are discovered, my application may be rejected and, if I am employed, my employment may be terminated at any time.\nIn consideration of my employment, I agree to conform to The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House's rules and regulations, and I agree that my employment and compenstation can be terminated, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time, at either my or The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House's option.\nI also understand and agree that the terms and conditions of my employment may be changed, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time by The Dolphin Bar & Shrimp House's.\nSignature\nCONTACT\n1401 NE Indian River Dr\nJensen Beach, FL 34957\n27°13’21.9″N – 80°12’35.2″W\n(772) 781-5136\ndolphinwebmail@dolphinbar.com\nHOURS\nMon-Thu: 11:30am-11:00pm\nFri & Sat: 11:30am-11:00pm\nSunday: 10:00am-11:00pm\nBY SEA\n27°13’21.9″N – 80°12’35.2″W\nComing from the North:\nafter Channel Marker 223\nComing from the South:\nafter Channel Marker 224\n© 2025 Main Street Media 360.
