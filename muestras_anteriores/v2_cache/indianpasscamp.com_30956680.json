It's an hour east of Panama City and a half-hour more from the trendy beaches of South Walton (Grayton Beach, Seaside, Watercolor and Rosemary Beach).\nIf you come for the fishing, you can bring your boat or\ncharter a local fishing guide\n. Directly across from our campground, is St. Vincent Island, a 10 mile long, mile wide National Wildlife Refuge that is home to Sambar deer, bald eagles, and an abundance of other wildlife. If you’d like to check it out, perhaps on a rented bike, you could catch a ferry at the\nboat launch\n. Maybe you’ll see some of the dolphins that like to feed in the Pass.\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\nCONTACT US\n/$\n$\nFor general inquiries and further information, please contact us:\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n2817 Indian Pass Road\nPort St. Joe, Florida 32456\n(850) 990-4833\n​\ninfo@indianpasscamp.com\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\nName\n/$\n$\nEmail\n/$\n$\nPhone\n/$\n$\nMessage\n/$\n$\nThanks for contacting us!
