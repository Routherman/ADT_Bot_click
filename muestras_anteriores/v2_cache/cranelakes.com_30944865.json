We intended the house as a winter home and planned to be “snowbirds”. That lasted for 3 years and we moved down from Maryland full-time.

As we are both from New York, and a few years shy of retirement, we began our search for the right fit. It didn’t take long to realize that the “Sunshine State” was the place for us! We found Crane Lakes online and planned on making it our first stop to visit. As we drove into the community for the first time, we remember how inviting and impressed we were by the beautifully manicured landscaping, laced with flowers, ponds and fountains. We then met Joan & Andy, two wonderful ladies whom were both warm and welcoming. Joan took us on a tour, showing us several of the lovely Palm Harbor homes available at that time. Needless to say… it was love at first sight! This place had it all, and we instantly knew the bar had been set! Joan encouraged us to continue looking at other communities, but said that we would be back! Joan was right. We have since purchased our “forever” home here in Crane Lakes and couldn’t be happier.\nMore Testimonials\n/.main\nHome\nCommunity\nFeatures\nEvents Calendar\nNewsletters\nBuy a Home\nLocation / Map\nPhoto Gallery\nTestimonials\nCrane’s Roost\nContact Us\n© 2025 —\nCrane Lakes Golf & Country Club\n•\n1850 Crane Lakes Blvd.\nPort Orange\nFL\n32128\t\t\t\t\t\t\t•\n386-304-6777\nhttp://www.cranelakes.com\n— All Rights Reserved",
