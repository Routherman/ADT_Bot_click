My name is Alfredo Saltos, I am the proud owner of Havana Delights Café here in Bartow, Florida. I started this restaurant with my wife Christine in 2008 when we moved from Miami to Lakeland. Our goal is to bring the authentic taste of Cuba and the modern twist of Miami to Polk County. For the past 10+ years we have accomplished that, we have been featured in multiple magazines and news articles for out wonderful dishes. Please come and visit us where you come as a guest and leave as family!\nCopyright © 2024 Havana Delights Café - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by\nGoDaddy",
