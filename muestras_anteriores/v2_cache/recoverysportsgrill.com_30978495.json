The name came from the restaurant’s proximity to the hospital, with the idea being that Recovery Room would serve as a getaway for those who were at the hospital during trying times, as well as the local sports buffs.\nToday, there are 10 restaurants in five states. Don’s vision of a family-oriented restaurant has not been lost as the company moves forward in its expansion. We are a company that is not just passionate about sports—though we all are serious sports fans—but also dedicated to creating a fun and exciting environment focused on bringing the local community together over great food and drinks. As a way to give back, we even offer local sports groups and local organizations\nfundraising opportunities\n.\nFind Nearest RSG\nLearn More About BBL Hospitality\n.entry-content\n#post-##\n\"Why are you called Recovery Sports Grill?\"\n.entry-header\nFounded by Don Led Duke, owner of BBL Companies, Recovery Sports Grill is more than just a sports grill—it’s a fan- and family-friendly restaurant with\ngreat food and drinks\n, and a casual atmosphere tied together by local and professional sports.\nRecovery Sports Grill, managed by BBL Hospitality, started as the Recovery Room Sports Grill in 2007, a single location across from Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York.
