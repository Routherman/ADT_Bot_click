The dog park here is huge and filled with obstacles to play on. In it is also a dog wash station. You’ll have to bring your own water bottles to give “Fido” a drink from, but otherwise it’s one of the nicest dog runs we’ve seen at an RV park. The RV park itself is very well maintained, restrooms clean, sites level and paved and long enough for a tow vehicle. It’s super easy access to I-75, but sheltered enough that you don’t hear road noise. We enjoyed our 2 night stop over very much.\nMarie L\n,\nFrom TripAdvisor\nExcellent customer service! We stayed at this campground for two weeks. The campground staff, including store, registration, and maintenance, was very helpful and accommodating. There were interesting animals living in the park – an emu, two donkeys, a pot-bellied pig, a horse, a cow, and 6 beautiful macaws. Most were rescues. All of the park was clean and well maintained. It was close to Gainesville and shopping, restaurants, etc. I would definitely recommend it to other campers.\nJ.R.\n,\nFrom TripAdvisor\nHighly recommend! Traveling home with our camper, 3 kids, and our dog and our truck broke down on the highway. After getting a tow truck we called Travelers Campground and they told us they would stay late to help us get set up. They greeted us at the front and led us in to our sight. Vicki and Charles made sure we had everything we needed that night. Knowing our vehicle was in the shop Vicki showed up the next morning with breakfast for our family. The kids were thrilled! They also offered to take us to the store on their day off. The property is beautiful! In the back they even have some animals that the kids loved to go visit. Some goats, horses, donkey, & birds! They have a large fenced in area for dogs to play too. We can’t thank them enough for their kind and wonderful hospitality in our time of need. We will be back!\nHaylie T\n,\nFrom Facebook\nWe loved this place! Spacious, clean bathhouses with plenty of hot water, new washer and dryer in the laundry area. Pool was great and all of the wonderful animals were just fantastic and they kept the park immaculate. You can tell that the owners bend over backwards to make this place a really welcoming place — down to details like good directional signs, and free popcorn and coffee in the front office. I can’t think of one thing I didn’t like. We had three little ones who are already asking to come back again. I wish we could stay longer!!!\nA.R.\n,\nFrom Facebook\nStarting our “meander” from central FL to the Outer Banks of NC, stopped here for a few days of R&R after packing up for the summer. Lovely place, very quiet, pretty rolling hills and animals everywhere. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. When the young man lead us to our site, he waited until I hooked up the electric to make sure everything was working properly; I’ve stayed in MANY RV parks never had that happen before!\nMike K\n,\nFrom Facebook\nOur very first stay ever in an RV park. Just got a travel trailer and this was a great stay. Loved the scenery and the animals especially the Hyacinth MaCaws!!!\nPeter S\n,\nFrom Good Sam\nWe just want to give a great big “THANK YOU” to all the staff at Traveler’s Campground for being so kind and supportive to us while our granddaughter was at the UF Health Congenital Heart Center. Anyway you all could help us, you did. We always felt safe and secure at the park. Our little heart warrior is home now and doing well. I suspect we will be going back to Gainesville for checkups in the future. Traveler’s Campground will be our home base for camping while there. Again, you all are the BEST.
