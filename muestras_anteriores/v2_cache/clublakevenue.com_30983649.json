We wanted to get married out of Florida because we wanted an outdoor venue with a ceremony backdrop with beautiful trees, nature, etc and didn’t think we could find it near home. Boy were we wrong. Club Lake was the first and only place we visited. Both my husband and I fell in love with it instantly and knew it was the one! Natalie made the process so smooth and easy. They provide great options for a bride planning their own wedding and I couldn’t have been happier! It was a perfect day and let me tell you your wedding photos will be absolutely beautiful there. I am obsessed!”\n-Megan M\nREAD MORE REVIEWS\nAll the details for your\ndream wedding\nBuild your dream wedding package at Club Lake’s unique outdoor wedding venue located in Apopka, Florida, just north of Orlando.

We wanted to get married out of Florida because we wanted an outdoor venue with a ceremony backdrop with beautiful trees, nature, etc and didn’t think we could find it near home. Boy were we wrong. Club Lake was the first and only place we visited. Both my husband and I fell in love with it instantly and knew it was the one! Natalie made the process so smooth and easy. They provide great options for a bride planning their own wedding and I couldn’t have been happier! It was a perfect day and let me tell you your wedding photos will be absolutely beautiful there. I am obsessed!”\n-Megan M\nREAD MORE REVIEWS\nTESTIMONIALS\n“@3x\nClub Lake was an absolute dream of a venue.
