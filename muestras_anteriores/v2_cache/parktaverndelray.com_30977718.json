Our objective is to create an experience that will arouse and excite our guest’s senses. To that end, we will take the unusual step of making EVERYTHING in house; from bread to cured meats to condiments, et. al. We will be steadfast in our refusal to compromise on the quality and integrity of our food. Ingredients will be painstakingly sourced to assure that they are local, sustainable, and come from the highest quality artisans. Our source of supply will be “transparent” to our guests, and they will have the opportunity to learn from us who the best farmers, fisherman, and ranchers are.\nWe will also give unprecedented homage to the grape and the grain. Typically, ~50 wines will be available by the glass to enhance your dining pleasure, and these selections will be continually refreshed to assure that only the best of the best are represented; irrespective of the size of the winery. To excite even the most ardent aspiring sommelier’s, we will offer over 150 different selections of wines by the bottle.\nAdditionally, we will offer an extensive selection of hand crafted cocktails, and daily infused spirits, using only the freshest seasonal ingredients. These will be available individually, or by the pitcher, to assist in making any social gathering a memorable occasion. We will have an extensive collection of spirits from all corners of the globe. Our bourbon will be the pride of Kentucky and our scotch will make any patron from Scotland proud.\nLastly, but by no means least, Park Tavern’s location is set besides one of the oldest and grandest natural environments on Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach. Your moment of zen will be richly enhanced by an ambiance that is truly unique and on par with your food and beverage experience.\nclose .width-container\nOrder Delivery - UBER EATS\nNewsletter\nWe are open\nMonday\n5:00PM to 10:00PM\nBar: 12:00AM\nTuesday\n5:00PM to 10:00PM\nBar: 12:00AM\nWednesday\n5:00PM to 10:00PM\nBar: 12:00AM\nThursday\n5:00PM to 10:00PM\nBar: 12:00AM\nFriday\n5:00PM -to 11:00PM\nBar: 2:00AM\nSaturday\nBrunch 10AM to 3PM | 4PM to11:00PM\nBar: 2:00AM\nSunday\nBrunch 10AM to 3PM | 4PM to 10:00PM\nBar: 12:00AM\nVisit us\nLocated at (Worthing Place / Atlantic Avenue)\n32 SE 2nd Ave, Delray Beach, FL 33444\nPhone:\n561.265.5093\nE-mail:\ninfo@parktaverndelray.com\nclose .social-icons\nFollow Us!\nOpen Table Diners’ Choice 2024\nclose footer-count\nclose #footer-widgets\nclose .width-container\nclose .widget-area-highlight\nclose #main\nReservations & Directions\nAbout\nEmployment\nGift Card\nAccessibility\nclose #copyright\nWebsite by:\nJSMediaDesign.com\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nstart Simple Custom CSS and JS\nend Simple Custom CSS and JS\nPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of\nwebsite accessibility",
