      "text": "our story\nRed Crab Juicy Seafood\nwas born from a shared vision of three lifelong friends who grew up near the East Coast. Together, they decided to create a dining experience that captures the essence of true\nseafood boil\n. After years of experimenting with spices and seasonings, they found the perfect aromatic, spicy, and savory blend that would give\nRed Crab\nits signature flavor. This marked the beginning of an incredible journey into the hearts and palates of seafood lovers along the East Coast.\nHow We Started\nRed Crab\nfirst opened in Florida after our founders fell in love with\nseafood boil\n. Our founders realized that they had an opportunity to improve upon the flavor they loved. After a year of experimenting with spices and seasonings from all over the world, they finally found the perfect combination that would give\nRed Crab\nits signature flavor. THIS BLEND WAS AROMATIC, SPICY, AND SAVOURY – TOO GOOD NOT TO SHARE WITH THE WORLD. THUS CAME THE FIRST RED CRAB JUICY SEAFOOD, AND THE REST IS HISTORY!\nExplore Our Menu\nOur Journey\nWhat Sets Us Apart\nWhile many\nseafood boil restaurants\nrely on mass-produced seasoning packets from external vendors, we create all our seasonings in-house. Our signature\nseafood boil\ncombines fresh, high-quality seafood with our secret in-house blend of spices and sauces.\nWhere Its Been\nSince the opening of our first Red Crab in Florida, we have worked hard to bring our\nseafood boil\nexperience to over 40 restaurants across the East Coast and Midwest. This has allowed us to connect with diverse communities that share our love for\nseafood boil\n.\nWhats Next\nAs we continue to grow, we remain true to our roots, ensuring that every\nRed Crab\nreflects our dedication to quality and taste. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion, enjoying a meal with friends, or simply craving\nseafood boil\n, we can’t wait to share our love for\nseafood\nwith you!\nNews\nRead more about special promotions, community events, and updates from our restaurants.\nCheck out our blog",
