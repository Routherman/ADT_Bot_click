The Orlando-Melbourne International Airport located in the center of the city is just 20 minutes from Enchanted Lakes. Malabar’s proximity to Orlando’s mega attractions like Walt Disney World and Kennedy Space Center makes Enchanted Lakes an ideal base to experience the magic that Florida’s beautiful Space Coast has to offer.\nIn 2019, Space Coast made it on CNN Travel’s top spots to visit, impressively judged from a pool of tourism sites not just nationwide, but worldwide! Only four U.S. destinations made the final cut – Space Coast, New York City, Grand Canyon, and Hawaii Island.",
