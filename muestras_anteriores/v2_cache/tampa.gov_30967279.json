This includes labor and material rentals for safe power distribution in the exhibit halls, ballrooms, breakout rooms, exterior space, and other production areas, excluding any specialty A/V or rigging cabling for wall, ceiling, or floor utility access.\nPlease note that there is no complimentary power for show management or exhibitor purposes throughout the venue, including wall outlets in meeting rooms.\nEDLEN will not tape down or ramp cords that are not EDLEN property, such as specialty A/V or rigging cabling running to and from production distros or panels.\nAll equipment, regardless of power source, must comply with federal, state, and local codes. EDLEN reserves the right to inspect all electrical devices and connections to ensure compliance with all codes for which labor charges can be incurred. Under license, EDLEN is required to refuse connections where the Exhibitor, Show Planner, or Exhibitor Appointed Contractor’s (EAC) wiring or equipment is not under electrical codes or secured adequately in high-traffic areas for safety purposes.\nThe outlet rates do not include equipment, connections, special wiring, or distribution of the outlets to other locations within the work area space or booth locations. Distribution to all other locations requires labor, material rental fees, and floor plans with measurements and orientation by each work area. Floor plans must be submitted 21 days prior to move-in, or additional fees will be charged.\nThere is a minimum charge of 1 hour for installation and 1/2 hour for removal. For assistance in calculating labor, contact\nTampa@EDLEN.com\nBased on on-site audits, additional charges, including outlets, materials, and prevailing labor rates, may be applied at the conclusion of events.\nBy placing an order, exhibitors and show organizers agree to accept EDLEN’s payment policy and the contract terms and conditions.\nPower Requirements\nThe UL listing plate on the back of the equipment identifies the required amperage/wattage. For multiple pieces of equipment, add the amperage/wattage to get the total needed. Before placing your utility order, submit a photo of the plug or adapter to\nTampa@EDLEN.com\nto ensure proper connectivity and power distribution.

Once there, Exhibitors must create an account and search for the specific event. Orders can also be placed through EDLEN Exhibition Services order forms in your exhibitor kit.\nWall power throughout the Tampa Convention Center is not complimentary for show management, production, and exhibit purposes and will be charged based on the wall outlet amperage prevailing rates.\nFor Show Planners, the EDLEN team will prepare a customized estimate based on your event’s specifications, including equipment sets with measured and marked floor plans by the work area. Contact\nTampa@EDLEN.com\nto request an estimate.\nStandard wall and other permanent building utility outlets or sockets are not part of the exhibit or production space and may not be used unless electrical services have been ordered through EDLEN.\nGenerators\nGenerators are not permitted inside the Tampa Convention Center property. Generators used outside must be pre-approved and ordered directly through EDLEN Exhibition Services.\nCeiling Drops\nCeiling drops utilize electrical access from the ceiling as required for lighting, rigging, etc. Ceiling drops are available for booth, lighting, and rigging motor power in the exhibit halls and ballrooms and can be ordered directly through EDLEN Exhibition Services by contacting\nTampa@EDLEN.com\n. Prevailing outlets, material rentals, and labor rates will apply.\n24-Hour Power\nPower is provided 24 hours a day for the duration of the show. There are no daily or consumption charges in addition to the services ordered. However, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service due to events beyond our control (e.g., power outages).\nAdditional charges, including outlets, materials, and prevailing labor rates, may be applied after events based on onsite audits.\nFloor Plans\nTo ensure proper utility placement for exhibitors, a booth floor plan showing the placement of electricity, internet, telephone, etc., must be submitted 21 days before move-in to ensure a timely installation. Failure to provide floor plans with measurements may result in services not being installed and additional costs being charged. For exhibitor booth floor plan templates, please reference the EDLEN Electrical or Plumbing order form in your exhibitor kit or request them from\ntampa@edlen.com\nFor show organizers, we highly recommend working with your designated general contractor, decorator, or audiovisual and production partner to prepare floor plans for the areas marked where power is needed. Your EDLEN Event Services Manager can also help and advise on approximate placement to ensure efficient power distribution based on the room and equipment set for your specific event requirements. For blank floor plan templates or CAD exhibit hall/meeting room shells, please contact your Event Manager for the Tampa Convention Center.\nLighting\nThe Tampa Convention Center is equipped with high-intensity, energy-efficient LED lighting.

Due to the intricate workings of equipment, vehicles, and marine vessels, EDLEN electricians and staff are strictly prohibited from boarding a vehicle or vessel to diagnose any power issues beyond the EDLEN receptacle at the designated outlet or service location. Our electrician will verify that the voltage matches (within tolerance) the ordered power and the output of the receptacle provided. Metering can be verified onsite.\nHowever, further diagnoses beyond the receptacle will be at the client’s expense and require their certified technician. Please send a photo of the connector to\nTampa@edlen.com\nto confirm receptacle and connection compatibility.\nCancellation Policy\nCredit will not be given for services installed and not used. All orders are subject to a 25% cancellation fee if canceled in writing and received by Edlen (21) calendar days or less before the first contracted event move-in date.  Except for sales tax, Edlen will not refund overpayment in amounts less than $50.00 unless specifically requested in writing.\nIf the event is canceled within 90 days before the first contracted event move-in day, all orders are subject to a 25% cancellation fee.

These entities are established to advise on specialized topics such as historic preservation, budget and finance, law enforcement oversight, and code enforcement.

These entities are established to advise on specialized topics such as historic preservation, budget and finance, law enforcement oversight, and code enforcement. Depending on their focus, boards and commissions may be managed by individual city departments—like the Architectural Review Commission under Development & Growth Management—or by the Office of the City Clerk, which oversees administrative and quasi-judicial boards such as the Civil Service Board and Code Enforcement Board. Through their work, these boards help shape city policies, resolve disputes, and enhance government transparency and accountability.\nTop Links\n¶\nAgendas\nApplications for Appointment\nCTTV Live\nCalendar\nBoard Information\nActive Board Members\nSoon to Expire Terms\nOpen Positions\nApply for an Initial Board Position or Reappointment Using Online Form\nExplore Boards and Commissions\n¶\nHousing and Community Development\nAffordable Housing Advisory Committee\nThe Affordable Housing Advisory Committee (AHAC) shall serve as the advisory review board to periodically evaluate established policies, procedures, ordinances, land development regulations, and the local government comprehensive plan, and reports its finding to the Mayor and City Council with recommended changes.\nAffordable Housing Advisory Committee\nArchitectural Review & Historic Preservation\nArchitectural Review Commission\nThe Historic Preservation Commission's mission is to recommend designations, conservation districts, and historic districts.  The HPC is eager to access Tampa's historic resources and has incorporated into its work plan the goal to systematically survey and hopefully, protect previously unsurveyed areas of the city.\nArchitectural Review Commission\nArchitectural Review & Historic Preservation\nBarrio Latino Commission\nThe Barrio Latino Commission has the responsibility of preserving the historic fabric of the District and maintaining its architectural integrity.  The Ybor City Historic District has many character-defining features: pedestrian scale, mixed-use main streets, as well as its unique structures such as the Social Clubs and Cigar Factory buildings.
