Thomas St. Plant City, FL 33563 | 813-752-0728\n/$\n$\nPlant City Entertainment, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nHome\nAbout\nTickets\nMembership\nContact\nMore\nUse tab to navigate through the menu items.\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nThe History of\nPlant City Entertainment\n/$\n$\nPlant City Entertainment, Inc. (PCE) is a nonprofit community theater organization based in Plant City, Florida. Founded in 1980, it has become a cornerstone of the local arts scene, offering theatrical productions and fostering community involvement in the performing arts.\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\nOrigins and Early Years\n/$\n$\nThe inception of community theater in Plant City can be attributed to Clare Mills, a young woman who, after returning to Plant City post-college and beginning her teaching career, recognized a void in the local arts scene. Having been involved in theater and dance during her college years, she missed these art forms and was inspired to explore whether the community would support a local theater initiative.\n​\nCollaborating with David Graves, the choral director at Plant City High School at the time, Mills organized the first production—a variety show titled “Let’s Hear It for Me.” This inaugural performance took place in August 1980, staged outdoors on the paved area at the old Union Station Depot in downtown Plant City. The depot, unused for years, required significant cleaning and preparation, which was undertaken by dedicated theater enthusiasts who volunteered their time to transform the space into a makeshift performance venue.\n​\nWith no initial funding, the fledgling theater group sought assistance from the Arts Council of Plant City, which provided a $400 contingency fund. At that time, the theater operated under the umbrella of the arts council.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nIncorporation and Growth\n/$\n$\nOver the ensuing years, the community theater gained momentum, attracting more participants and audiences. Recognizing the need for a formal structure to support its growth and to apply for nonprofit status, the group incorporated as Plant City Entertainment, Inc.\n​\nInitially, PCE did not have a permanent home and performed in various venues around Plant City, including the train depot, Hillsborough Community College, The Trinkle Center, and the Cornerstone Building. However, in 2009 the organization purchased its current facility at 101 North Thomas Street, providing a dedicated space for rehearsals and performances.\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\nContinuing the Legacy\n/$\n$\nToday, Plant City Entertainment continues to thrive as a volunteer-driven organization, producing multiple shows each season. The theater's mission is to \"Instill the love of live theater in the child, renew the magic in our senior citizens, and for all those ages in between, to promote self-confidence, teamwork, and fun for all, as we strive to entertain.”\n​\nRecent productions have showcased the theater's commitment to offering diverse and engaging performances. PCE remains committed to its community roots, offering opportunities for anyone to participate in all aspects of theater production, from acting and directing to set design and stage management. Its enduring presence reflects the community's support and the organization's dedication to the arts in Plant City.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nMission Statement\n/$\n$\n\"Instill the love of live theater in the child, renew the magic in our senior citizens, and for all those ages in between, to promote self-confidence, teamwork, and fun for all, as we strive to entertain.\"\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nMeet the Board\n/$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\n$\nVictor Hamilton,\nPresident\n/$\n$\nVictor Hamilton's enduring passion for Plant City Entertainment (PCE) began in 2006, captivated by a friend's performance in \"MASH\".

In that same pivotal year, Victor was elected to the PCE board and has since served with distinction as President for seven years. Beyond the stage, Victor cherishes time with his family, including his daughter, son, daughter-in-law, and four, soon to be five, grandchildren. He also dedicates his time to leading worship at First Baptist Church of Crystal Springs and serves on the board of the Plant City Christmas Parade.

It was the launching pad in pursuing her talents. She did many shows with PCE until She revived a scholarship to Florida School Of The Performing Arts where she studied Musical Theatre. She pursued a professional Career working in theme Parks, film, and many years performing on The High Seas with Royal Carribean Cruise Line , being a part of the first fleet of “Mega Ships”.

After that, he receded into the role of frequent spectator until 2015 when Kelley Powell née Gustafson asked him to run the sound and lights for the play she was directing, The Rainmaker. J.R. was soon being asked to run tech for many more shows, and eventually became the tech consultant for PCE, and then in 2024, a board member. Running the sound and light boards is a comfortable location for J.R., as he did this for about 35 years for his church.
