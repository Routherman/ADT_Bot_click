They wanted a clean, safe, and secure space where their kids could be free to dream, learn, interact, and explore as they pleased.\nAnd what better way to do that than to step into a whole new world where everything you see, touch and taste is candy-themed?\nA Truly Magical Experience\nOur Vision\nWe envision a truly unique kids entertainment center that will become a regular part of family fun for many years to come. We see ourselves providing the ultimate joy-filled experience where children can learn how to dream big even if they’re still very small. We look forward to growing the Candy Wonderland family with a team that is dedicated to seeing our success and passionate about caring for children. We are very excited about broadening our horizons and expanding to multiple new locations in Florida and across the United States, becoming a household name that is synonymous with good fun, cherished memories, value for money, and incomparable service.\nOur Mission\nWe’re on an exciting mission to provide kids with a unique playtime experience where their little minds can wonder and they can play to their hearts’ content.

We prioritize your children’s’ health and safety by providing a clean, secure and kid-friendly playground that is filled with opportunities to learn and develop their imaginations while remaining engaged and keeping active. We simply weren’t satisfied with the entertainment options that were available to our family, which is why we’re dedicated to providing high-quality play facilities that go hand-in-hand with consistently exceptional service you can count on.\nOur Values\nOur Happy Parents\nOur candy-themed entertainment center is geared towards providing an unforgettable experience and is the perfect setting for the ultimate birthday party or celebration.
