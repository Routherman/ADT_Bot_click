Children can respond to animals in ways they often can’t with people. The human-animal connection can be mutually beneficial to both humans and animals. Learning to care for animals seems to develop a sense of responsibility, empathy, and caring among children who may not have experienced that themselves.\nIt is with this philosophy that our ranch has chosen to share our farm and the animals we care for with the public.\nWhat We Do\nThe Rockin H Ranch is a premier Wedding and Events Venue located in Palm City, Florida. The weddings are pretty self explanatory, but to see the kind of events we host, visit our Other Events page.\nWoman-Owned\nWe are proud to be a woman-owned business here in South Florida. To learn more about Marcia and how she started it all, visit our\nHistory\npage.\nAgritourism\nWe are an official agricultural location.
