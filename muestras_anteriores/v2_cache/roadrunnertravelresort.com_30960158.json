My children grew up within the park and started working here at very young age. For both of them, their first job was bagging ice. As they aged, they worked in the store stocking shelves and working behind the register\n1979\nOn December 20, 1979, my husband and I acquired the Road Runner Trailer Park in Fort Pierce, Florida, with a vision to revitalize the neglected property into a thriving destination for RV travelers. At the time of purchase, the park encompassed 28 acres and faced imminent closure due to neglect by the county. Despite the challenges, we embarked on a comprehensive cleanup effort to reclaim the land for development.\nThe park, initially comprising 92 sites, suffered from neglect, with approximately 15 acres marred by debris and abandoned machinery. Through diligent efforts, we transformed the neglected portions of the park into welcoming spaces, adding 16 new sites to accommodate our growing community of travelers. Today, Road Runner Travel Resort stands as a testament to our commitment to excellence and restoration, offering a tranquil retreat amidst Florida's natural beauty.\nFrom 1980 to the Early 2000’s\nAt Road Runner Travel Resort in Fort Pierce, our journey of growth parallels our unwavering commitment to elevating the guest experience. By the early 1980s, our vision for modernization and expansion had already taken root, propelling us into ambitious projects to enhance our facilities and amenities.\nWe embarked on a mission to refresh our bathhouse and laundry facility, renovating them with state-of-the-art equipment, fixtures, and eco-friendly solar panels. In response to rising guest expectations, we introduced new sections like H and P, while our community rallied around the construction of a spacious Recreation Hall under the expert guidance of Howard Thompson, a cherished member of our extended family.\nIn 1983, our dedication to providing exceptional experiences led us to develop an additional ten acres adjacent to the park, allowing us to welcome more guests into our thriving community. The grand opening of our new S section in the following year marked yet another milestone in our journey.\nMeanwhile, my husband's service as a St. Lucie County Commissioner underscored our enduring commitment to community engagement and leadership. The acquisition of 11 acres on Indrio Road provided the canvas for our new home, which quickly became a beloved gathering spot for our guests and neighbors alike.\nAs we ventured into the early 2000s, our focus remained on enhancing infrastructure and amenities. Road paving and street light installation projects were completed, ushering in a new era of modernization. Additionally, the creation of a three-acre golf course amidst Florida's breathtaking scenery added another layer of excitement to the Road Runner experience.\nExpansion and the last 18 years\nAt Road Runner Travel Resort, our resilience was put to the test in 2004 when Hurricanes Francis and Jean wreaked havoc on the Treasure Coast. Despite the challenges, we stood strong as a beacon of hope, extending aid and shelter to those impacted by the storms. In a spirit of community solidarity, we prioritized the needs of affected individuals by requesting some of our regular customers to cancel their reservations and opening our doors to provide refuge within our park.\nThough the hurricanes brought destruction to many, Road Runner emerged relatively unscathed, with minor damage to the recreation hall roof. In the aftermath, we seized the opportunity to enhance our resort facilities, starting with the reconstruction of the porch area. By replacing the outdated metal roof with tongue-in-groove wood paneling, we transformed the entrance into a welcoming space for our guests. Modern amenities such as fans, TVs, and Wi-Fi were added, creating a vibrant hub for entertainment and relaxation.\nRecognizing the evolving landscape of RV travel, we undertook a significant renovation of the park entrance in 2003. Enlarging culverts, widening the entrance, and enhancing signage and landscaping were among the improvements made to accommodate larger motor homes and travel trailers. Subsequent years saw further enhancements, with the D section undergoing a complete remodel in 2014 to introduce twenty new 50-amp sites and upgraded amenities. Similarly, the pull-through section was transformed in 2015, featuring concrete driveways and fireplaces on every site to enhance guest comfort and convenience.\nThroughout our journey, the dedication of our employees has been paramount in creating a welcoming and memorable experience for our guests. Looking ahead, our commitment to providing top-quality service and accommodations remains steadfast, ensuring that every visitor feels at home at Road Runner Travel Resort. We invite you to experience our hospitality firsthand, whether you're seeking adventure, relaxation, or simply a place to call home on the road.\nOur Story\nFor over forty five years, this has been a family-owned resort campground.
