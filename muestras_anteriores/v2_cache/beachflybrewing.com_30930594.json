      "text": ".entry-header\nBeachFly Brewing Company, Brevard County’s newest brewery, was created by mother/son team Lisa Freismuth and Zach Featherstone. We got the idea when Lisa’s brother, Phil, owner of Horsefly Brewing Company in Montrose Colorado, visited Lisa on the Space Coast and witnessed the growth of the craft beer industry in Florida. Zach was a Biomedical Engineer tiring of the corporate world and always had a dream of “having a bar by the beach.” Lisa, a local CPA, joined her son as financial advisor and partner. The two collaborated and soon BeachFly Brewing Company was born!\nThe brewery started in Indian Harbour Beach in November 2018 with three beers.  BeachFly moved to Rockledge in 2020, renovated the building, and reopened April 1, 2022.  The brewery now has twenty-one beers on tap – five core beers and eleven seasonal/rotating taps. BeachFly’s core beers on tap are a tropical twist to the classic styles which are always sessionable and particularly refreshing for a day at the beach or just relaxing in the Florida sun. The rotating selection ranges from experimental creations to classic styles, using locally sourced ingredients whenever possible.  We are proud to include gluten-reduced beers in the line up!\nThe brewpub also serves a menu of non-typical bar food, including appetizers, paninis, and desserts that incorporate beer into many of the recipes.  The most popular item is beer cheese made with our Sunrise Red Ale.  It’s served with a soft pretzel or as filling for roasted jalapeno poppers, made with fresh jalapenos, beer cheese, and bacon, or as beer cheese nachos.  Our pulled pork, marinated in BeachFLIIPA and has a tropical twist and it great on the nachos! To finish it off, our Key Lime Pie is the best we’ve ever tasted, and pairs well with Turtle Trax.\nWe are excited to open our new location in Rockledge, and hope Rockledgers are excited to have their own local brewery. The brewery has a definite beachy vibe, relaxed atmosphere, and great beers. Cheers to new friends, we’re glad you’re here!\n.entry-content .clear\n#post-##\n.entry-header\nBeachFly Brewing Company, Brevard County’s newest brewery, was created by mother/son team Lisa Freismuth and Zach Featherstone.
