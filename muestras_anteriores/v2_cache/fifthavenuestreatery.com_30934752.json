Living in Florida, we all love the outdoors and this charming location has a beautiful ambiance that is quaint casual dining experience during the day and a comforting dim lit environment by night.\nWe love this community and hope to provide an experience to remember.\nTim and Deborah\nMade Fresh From Scratch, Every Day.\nFRESH FLAVORS, MADE FROM SCRATCH\nWe have To Go available, as well as table service.\nCome try one of our signature items like “The Drunken Steer,” “Southern Caprese,” or any of our hot dog or hot beef options.\n.fl-post-content",
