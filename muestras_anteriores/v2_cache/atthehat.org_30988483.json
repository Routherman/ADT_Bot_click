From immersive theater at a historical park to the courtyard of a Greek restaurant, site-specific theater allows The Hat to activate the Bradenton community in new and dynamic ways. The Hat collaborates with Manatee County organizations, non-profits, and businesses to present new works, contemporary plays and musicals, and cabarets in unconventional spaces.\nMission\nThe Hat Theater Collective enriches its community through culturally-important and inspirational theatrical experiences.\nTHE HAT THEATER COLLECTIVE ASPIRES…\nTo be a theater for everyone.\nTo create conversation.\nTo be a thought-leader among cultural organizations on the Gulf Coast.\nTo produce high-quality art.\nTo be a connector between other cultural organizations, not-for-profits, and businesses through exciting partnerships, collaborations, and conversations.\nTo provide a safe haven and space for directors, writers, designers, actors, and artisans that foster and nurture their creative ability and expand their talents.\nCONNECTION\n〰️\nTEAMWORK\n〰️\nEMPATHY\n〰️\nINCLUSIVITY\n〰️\nACCESSIBILITY\n〰️\nCONNECTION\n〰️\nTEAMWORK\n〰️\nEMPATHY\n〰️\nINCLUSIVITY\n〰️\nACCESSIBILITY\n〰️\nCONNECTION 〰️ TEAMWORK 〰️ EMPATHY 〰️ INCLUSIVITY 〰️ ACCESSIBILITY 〰️\nCreating “The Hat”\nStephen Sondheim's musical, \"Sunday in the Park with George,\" contains an iconic song about artistry called \"Finishing The Hat.” In the song, the character (based on real-life artist) George Seurat describes the act of creating and how fluid and demanding it is - and then the end product is just that. As simple as The Hat. It’s demanding, monotonous, and a thorough process. Creating. Art. And in the end, he says, “Look, I made a hat. Where there never was a hat.”\nAnd that’s art, isn’t it? Creating something of nothing. Seeing the world in a different way. Providing perspective to what others see as straightforward and simple. The act of creation is anything but.\nFounded by Producing Artistic Director,\nDanae DeShazer\n, The Hat Theater Collective started creating immersive theatrical experiences in 2023.\nDanae DeShazer\nFOUNDER + PRODUCING ARTISTIC DIRECTOR\nDanae DeShazer\n(she/her/hers) is a professional director, actor, teaching artist, and choreographer with a varied career that has swept her all across the country.
