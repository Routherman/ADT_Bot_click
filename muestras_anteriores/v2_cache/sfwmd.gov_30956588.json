These activities include:\nThe annual Hurricane Freddy exercise that features a full activation of the District’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Participation is District-wide and includes all levels of management.\nA monthly technical feasibility test of the equipment in the Emergency Operations Center.\nMonthly satellite phone tests between the District’s Water Operations Control Center, field stations and service centers.\nConducting onsite tabletop exercises with Field Station Incident Command Team personnel throughout the year to test operational planning capabilities.\nCoordination of annual meeting for Emergency Coordination Officers with Florida's other water management districts, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and State EOC personnel.\nParticipation by regional representatives throughout the year in county Local Mitigation Strategy committees and Community Rating System efforts.\nSupporting local jurisdictions with emergency modeling information to assist in both mitigation planning efforts, as well as response to flooding emergencies.\nCoordination before, during and after storms with local drainage districts to disseminate information.\nEmergency Resources\nCounty emergency management agencies (EMAs) also prepare for emergencies year-round. Their websites provide information resources to assist residents in preparing for emergencies.\nDuring emergencies, instructions and information regarding evacuation, shelters, food and water distribution are coordinated and disseminated by officials at county EMAs. They also provide contact information on their websites for local agencies within their counties that provide community support to impacted residents. Many county EMAs also maintain Facebook and Twitter accounts that are frequently updated with information.\nCounty Emergency Management Websites and Social Media\nBroward\nCharlotte\nCollier\nGlades\nHendry\nHighlands\nLee\nMartin\nMiami-Dade\nMonroe\nOkeechobee\nOrange\nOsceola\nPalm Beach\nPolk\nSt. Lucie\nState and Federal Websites and Social Media\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\nReady.gov\nOperations\nThroughout the year, SFWMD Operations and Maintenance staff oversee approximately 2,175 miles of canals and 2,130 miles of levees/berms, 98 pump stations and more than 936 water control structures and 620 project culverts. With specialized expertise, they maintain all the equipment to ensure this vast water management system is ready to manage flood control during and after summer rainstorms, tropical storms or major hurricanes.\nDuring times of disaster and emergency recovery, access to canals becomes extremely essential as recovery teams navigate through the canal system to perform emergency maintenance tasks. Field staff continually perform routine maintenance, repair and debris removal as well as keep rights-of-way clear to maintain access to canals.\nHeadquarter Facilities\nSFWMD Facilities staff maintain critical functions vital to emergency storm response. Year-round tasks include checks and deployment of the following for headquarter buildings, including the Emergency Operations Center:\nShutters, emergency generators and satellite phones\nSupplies, tools and portable gas cans for chainsaws\nFleet vehicles and boat tie-down\nDiesel fuel\nMap: Who to Contact for Localized Flooding\nLocal (secondary) canal systems in South Florida are maintained and operated by cities, counties and water control districts – also known as 298 districts for the chapter of Florida Statutes that outlines their responsibilities. These secondary canal systems receive water from neighborhoods and store excess water or move it to the regional flood control system managed by the South Florida Water Management District.\nMore than 100 water control districts and local governments operate secondary canal systems within the SFWMD's 16-county region. To see which entity is responsible for the secondary system where you live, type your address into the search bar on the map below. You can find contact information and more details in the Near Me box or by clicking directly on the map.\n* NOTE TO MOBILE USERS: For a mobile-friendly version of this map, please\nclick here\n.\nFlorida Natural Hazards Interagency Work Group Annual Report\nIn compliance with\nFlorida Statutes (F.S.) 252.3655(2)(a)\n, the Natural Hazards Interagency Work Group of the Florida Department of Emergency Management provides an annual progress report on the implementation of the state’s hazard mitigation plan.

While on land, water has time to slowly seep into groundwater aquifers, replenishing our drinking water supply.\nLand for Conservation and Restoration\nAs the South Florida Water Management District's responsibilities have broadened over the decades to include ecosystem restoration, lands were purchased for their hydrologic benefits. Programs such as the 1981 Florida Resource Rivers Act, commonly known as \"Save Our Rivers,\" provided state funding for environmentally sensitive lands to be acquired, restored, protected and managed. Caring for the land requires an ongoing commitment to protect water resources, native plant communities, fish and wildlife populations and natural features of the land. We work with the private sector and other resource agencies as we dovetail our efforts for the public's benefit.\nPublic Use and Ongoing Activities\nProviding public access to public lands is mandated by the state and boldly embraced by the District. We cooperate with other state agencies, the federal government, counties, municipalities and the private sector to develop recreational access sites and appropriate facilities that are compatible with protecting our natural resources.\nRelated Links\nLand Management Plans\nConservation Land Maps\n1: Upper Lakes Land Management Region\n2: Kissimmee/Okeechobee Land Management Region\n3: East Coast Land Management Region\n4: Everglades Land Management Region\n5: West Coast Land Management Region\nManaging Land and Monitoring Resources\nManaging more than 1 million acres of public lands is an important responsibility for the South Florida Water Management District. A large number of these conservation lands are open to the public for recreation and nearly all these lands require some form of stewardship activity. The District relies on other agencies and the private sector to help manage some of these lands. Cooperative agreements set forth the type and extent of management assistance provided. Where cooperating entities, such as the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or the Florida Forest Service, have their own rules for a tract of land, the District's regulations supplement those.\nClick the tabs below to learn more about management activities on SFWMD lands.\nNatural Resources Monitoring\nExotic Plant Control\nPrescribed Burning\nRange Management\nResource Protection\nGeneral Maintenance\nNatural Resources Monitoring\nWHY DO WE MONITOR LAND?\nThe South Florida Water Management District monitors its land resources to determine the most effective practices for managing land for environmental purposes and to document the results of management activities.\nActive land management of natural areas is required in two situations, both of which require ongoing monitoring and evaluation:\nLand designated for conservation that has been modified by human activity but will be restored to natural conditions\nLand already in its natural condition that must be maintained\nRestoration is the most challenging kind of land management. It requires a range of actions, such as blocking or filling of drainage ditches, treatment of large stands of invasive exotic plants with herbicide, selective harvesting of timber and intense or frequent prescribed fire. Restoration projects typically call for frequent monitoring because the ecosystem responds so dramatically to restoration actions.\nHOW DO WE MONITOR?\nVegetation analysis »\nNative vegetation is monitored on SFWMD conservation lands because it is not only valuable in itself but critical in determining habitat value for wildlife. Plants are easier to see and count than animals, but more than 500 species of plants grow on District lands. Trained botanists are essential to this work.\nAnimal censuses »\nSupporting populations of native wildlife is one of the most important environmental purposes of District conservation lands. Each kind of animal requires a different approach to monitoring. Large birds and deer can be spotted from aircraft. Nesting songbirds are best located by their territorial calls. Nocturnal and secretive species such as Florida panthers can be detected by their tracks or droppings or by motion-capture cameras with flashes. Burrowing species such as gopher tortoises and sand skinks can be monitored by counting burrows or tell-tale marks left when they move through the sand. The elusive, nocturnal Florida muskrat makes nests of grasses and reeds that can be located by wading around in wetlands. The SFWMD relies heavily on experienced wildlife biologists from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for monitoring animal populations.\nPanoramic photo monitoring »\nPhotography is an efficient way to document the condition of a natural habitat. Although a photograph rarely allows identification of all plant species, it does instantly record a great deal of information about the sizes and spacing of trees, the density of shrub understory and the presence of grasses or herbaceous plants as a ground cover. These aspects of vegetation are what ecologists call habitat \"structure\" ̵ a very important part of what makes habitat suitable for particular wildlife. For example, scrub jays require shrubbery with open sandy areas and no large trees, while red cockaded woodpeckers demand large, well-spaced pines with little or no shrub layer. Effective land management has a lot to do with maintaining desirable habitat structure for native wildlife. A series of annual photographs tells the story of land that is basically unchanging, land gradually improving in structure or land that is moving away from ideal condition. This information helps the manager to adjust actions to meet wildlife goals. Comparing panoramas from different seasons is also a good way to get a feel for changes in habitat structure.\nExotic Plant Control\nDue to the extensive alteration of natural ecosystems and a subtropical climate that favors their growth, exotic plants have become well-established in the environments of South Florida. Invasion of natural communities by exotic plants on SFWMD properties can result in total displacement of native plants, loss of wildlife habitat, alteration of local hydrology, changes in natural fire conditions and degradation of public use areas. Exotic plant control consists of proper application of various environmentally acceptable chemical herbicides combined with biological controls and mechanical techniques.\nVegetation and Exotic Control\nPrescribed Burning\nFire management is part of an integrated stewardship program for restoring and maintaining the natural state and condition of SFWMD-owned and managed ecologically significant areas. Most native plant communities in Florida are fire-adapted thanks to the historically high rate of lightning-induced fires. Prescribed burns during the heaviest growing season are favored because of their historic significance and ecological benefits. Restoration of a natural fire regime to reduce the frequency of dangerous wildfires is a major goal of the fire management program.\nBecause prescribed fire is such an important tool for managing conservation lands in Florida, fire gets special monitoring attention. Each fire is evaluated with respect to how fast it spreads, size of flames, degree of charring of tree trunks and scorching of canopy, burning of litter and upper soil layers and consumption of shrubs and palm fronds. Weeks after a fire, the recovering forest is evaluated for mortality of trees and shrubs and for boring insect infestations of injured or stressed trees. Information from fire monitoring is used by land managers to make decisions about how much fuel will be allowed to accumulate and what weather conditions will be appropriate before the next fire is planned.\nPrescribed Burning – A Land Management Tool [PDF]\nRange Management\nMany of the lands acquired by the South Florida Water Management District have historically been used as cattle range. Previous owners are provided the opportunity to retain grazing rights through leasebacks and reservations for a pre-determined period. Grazing leases are being established through a private/public partnership on selected projects where sufficient rangeland is available and where the presence of cattle does not interfere with or negatively affect other resource management goals. These leases strive to encourage management partners to provide maintenance services (e.g. fencing, mowing, roller chopping, exotic plant control) in lieu of payment. Leases generally run for a period of five years, placing rangeland back on the county tax rolls during that time. In addition, leases reduce District management costs by encouraging in-kind services in lieu of lease payments.\nResource Protection\nThe resource protection program utilizes a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to protect the public and the vital natural resources found on and within the public lands and resource management areas. As part of the program, the SFWMD has adopted\nrules\nthat govern public use on these District lands.\nAn array of contractual and non-contractual arrangements are entered into by the SFWMD wherein law enforcement officers from county sheriff's offices, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection patrol public lands, including those acquired under Save Our Rivers to enforce federal and state laws and administrative code. Common problems encountered by these law enforcement officers, associated with the protection of natural areas, include: hunting, fishing and boating violations; dumping of wastes; unauthorized off-road vehicle operation; and trespassing onto adjacent private properties.\nReport a Problem\nProblems or violations occurring on these public properties may be reported to the South Florida Water Management District by calling (800) 432-2045.\nTo\nreport wildlife violations\n, contact the\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\n:\nStatewide: (888) 404-FWCC [3922]\nFrom a cell phone: dial *FWC\nIn case of emergencies, contact your local sheriff's office at: 911\nGeneral Maintenance\nGeneral maintenance is required for the large number of fire lines, roads, fences, culverts, houses and sheds associated with South Florida Water Management District lands. These activities include waste cleanup, building fire lines, repairing and replacing perimeter fences, mowing roadsides, replacing and repairing culverts and grading roads. Houses, barns, sheds and public use facilities also require periodic maintenance and repair for safe and enjoyable use by the public.\nSouth Florida Water Management District\nContact Information\n3301 Gun Club Road\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33406\n561-686-8800\n800-432-2045 (Florida Only)",
