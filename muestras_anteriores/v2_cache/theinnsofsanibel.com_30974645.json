Grounds were gorgeous! We met the owners who were very friendly and meticulous in the details of the resort...Would recommend staying at this quiet, conveniently located, high scale retreat.”\nBetty B.\n— Feb 2025\n“What a perfect Inn to stay at on Sanibel Island. The staff were incredible, a special shout out to Mikey and Kayla for an outstanding response to our needs. They are very caring and only want their guests to feel welcome and at home. The rooms were immaculate and the grounds were beautiful. The renovations they have done make it a perfect spot for a vacation. Our first visit to Sanibel Island, but not our last. We will be staying here again. Thank you for a wonderful trip to your island.”\nJudy\n— Feb 2025\n“The wait is over. The Sanibel Inn has reopened its doors to paradise. As usual, we had an absolutely wonderful time. The rooms are very comfortable and designed with a coastal feel with many upgrades. The grounds are very tropical and will look amazing once everything is in full bloom. It was wonderful to see some familiar faces, Kayla and Tyrone and meet new ones too. Tyrone, Jorge and Mamuka at the Beach Hut had our chairs and umbrella set up on the beach every morning. The staff was super friendly and always looking to help make your stay more memorable. Kudos to the general manager, Bill Wellman for making the reopening such a success. WE have already booked our return in September. Can't wait!”\nAnne\n— Feb 2025, St. Augustine, Florida\n“Amazing Beautiful Resort!!! Everything is redone, remodeled and brand new!!! Pool and Tikibar area were stunning, Brand new bicycles are free to guests with brand name PRIORITY...Great Stay, Awesome Staff and Beautiful Grounds! We will be back!!!!”\nMsdet1529\n— March 2025\n“Our stay at Sanibel Inn exceeded our hopes and expectations. The new accommodations are top-notch. Two restaurants (one in a lovely outdoor setting) make it possible to stay on the property and “veg-out.” The pool is steps from the rooms, and the beautiful beachfront is right there across a new boardwalk. The heart and soul to rebuild after Ian is evident in the tasteful decor, beautifully planned grounds and new plantings, and environmentally conscious infrastructure. Highly recommend!”\nC6107JWsusanp\n— May 2025\nThe Dunes course is closed for resurfacing until 10/17/25\nWe are excited to announce the regrassing of our 18-Hole course with all new Paspalum grass.
