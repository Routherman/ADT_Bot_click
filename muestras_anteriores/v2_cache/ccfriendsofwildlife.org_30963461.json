      "text": "Home\n5\nNews & About CCFW\n5\nAbout Us\nAbout Us\nCape Coral Friends of Wildlife\nis a volunteer organization whose purpose is to preserve and enhance the habitats of protected wildlife species and to educate the community about Cape Coral’s wildlife resources.\nBack in the 1960’s the Rosen Brothers came to Cape Coral to build a massive waterfront community. They brought in the largest collection of earth moving equipment that had ever been seen in Florida and proceeded to level 100 square miles of land and dig 400 miles of canals.\nThe large variety of wildlife that lived here was decimated.  What was once lush wooded areas, beautiful meadows, pristine streams, was reduced to a near wasteland.\nAs most of the wildlife left to find suitable habitat, the Burrowing Owls that lived in the outskirts of Lee County and Central Florida, found this prairie like habitat ideal, and began to move in and flourish.\nAs Cape Coral grows, the Florida\nScrub Jays\n, the\nBurrowing Owls\n, the\nGopher Tortoise\nand the\nBald Eagles\nand other wildlife that remain in the City are again at risk for extreme habitat loss.\nCape Coral Friends of Wildlife is working hard to preserve the habitat that our wildlife so desperately needs. All funding to keep this organization running is received from donations.\nIf you would like to  help preserve the wildlife in Cape Coral, consider a tax-exempt\ndonation\n. CCFW is a 501-C-3 organization, and all donations are tax deductible as allowed by law. No fees are paid to professional fund-raising consultants or solicitors. The organization receives 100% of each donation.\nBoard Officers\nPresident:\nJudy Mitchell\nVice President:\nMichiale Carney\nRecording Secretary:\nMichele Mold\nCorresponding Secretary\n:\nJanet Windisch\nTreasurer:\nShannon Miller\nMembers at Large\nJennifer Moss\nFinancial Data\nProposed Budget 2023 2024 Approved\nTreasurerReport231005\nTreasurerReport 230812\nTreasurerReport230910\nBalanceSheet23930\nBalanceSheet230831\nBalanceSheet230610\nRequest a Speaker\nCCFW volunteers are available to speak to students and civic associations about protecting Cape Coral's wildlife and habitats.\nShop CCFW Merchandise\nGet some unique apparel, wear your support for Cape Coral's wildlife and help further our mission by shopping CCFW merchandise.\nJoin/Renew Membership\nHelp support wildlife in Cape Coral by becoming a member, or renewing your existing membership.",
