Situated within the embrace of a tranquil tropical country setting, our winery, a family-owned and operated enterprise, proudly holds the distinction of being the southernmost winery in the continental U.S. What sets us apart? The visionary journey of our founders, Denisse and Peter Schnebly, who dared to transform winemaking by harnessing the essence of tropical fruits. This audacious approach has not only redefined winemaking but has created an unparalleled experience for every guest who walks through our doors.\nOur Story\nOur story began in 2004 and has since unfolded as a haven for wine connoisseurs seeking an experience that resonates beyond the ordinary. Across an expanse of 30 acres, our grounds thrive with a diverse array of mango, carambola, passion fruit, and lychee groves. These extraordinary fruits are the heartbeats of our diverse and captivating wine collection. Each bottle is a testament to our unwavering dedication to craftsmanship and innovation, a testament that continues to unfold with every sip.\nSteeped in dedication and inspired by nature’s elegance, our mission is to transport you to a realm of unforgettable sensations. As you sip our tropical fruit wines, surrounded by the gentle murmur of cascading waterfalls and the whimsical charm of tiki huts, we strive to create an escape that lingers in your memory. Our vision is a tapestry woven with the threads of passion, flavor, and relaxation—an oasis where each visit becomes a cherished memory, and every wine embodies the essence of our journey.\n305-242-1224 Ext. 117\n30205 SW 217th Ave\nHomestead Florida 33030\ninfo@schneblywinery.com\nschneblywinery\nSundays are all about wine, and our Black Weekend\n💃✨ Shake a leg with us at Schnebly Winery’s\nDouble the delight!

The day was clear and windy making it a great experience. We shared a bottle of the Category 3 Hurricane and it was  really good. We did not have time to try the brewery but I think it's a great excuse to go back. There are multiple wine options including wine tasting. It's a great place to spend an evening with friends or family. Totally recommend and I'm hoping to go back soon.\nRene Figueroa\n20:26 26 Oct 24\nThis is a place that you must visit when you’re in the Homestead area!

The day was clear and windy making it a great experience. We shared a bottle of the Category 3 Hurricane and it was  really good. We did not have time to try the brewery but I think it's a great excuse to go back. There are multiple wine options including wine tasting. It's a great place to spend an evening with friends or family. Totally recommend and I'm hoping to go back soon.\nRene Figueroa\n20:26 26 Oct 24\nThis is a place that you must visit when you’re in the Homestead area! Place is beautifully decorated and well thought out. They have a a lovely outdoor area where kids can run around and play while adults admire the exotic fish in the pond.\nThe food and service are top notch! I had never tried any tropical fruit wine before until I came to this place! Mia, our server, is extremely knowledgeable in the menu and offered us some suggestions! I had the burger and the meat was cooked to the temperature I requested and presentation was nice! We also had the tuna salad, which was very refreshing!\nTip: They also serve coffee! We had an expresso, latte and mocha!\nfelipe\n18:39 12 Oct 24\nIf you’re looking for a great experience at Schnebly Redlands Winery, ask for Layla as your waitress.
