Kevin is a senior landscape architect with England – Thims & Miller, Inc., responsible for creating aesthetic, sustainable and functional outdoor spaces. Kevin says he is passionate about park preservation, and as a landscape architect, he has worked on several new and existing park improvement designs throughout Northeast Florida. He will utilize his expertise to guide the nonprofit as it develops programs and initiatives for community engagement, education and enjoyment.\n“We welcome Kevin to the board and look forward to having his environmental expertise as we continue our mission of promoting and preserving our area’s parks and preserves,” said Fred Richards, executive director of TPF. “Kevin’s background and passion for our parks will greatly benefit me and the staff.”\nKevin, a Northeast Florida native, said the local flora and wildlife in the area have a special place in his heart. He graduated from the University of Florida, earning a bachelor’s degree in agricultural operations management and completing the five-year Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) program. Kevin is a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) and currently serves as the Florida Chapter member-at-large for Advocacy and Licensure and chair of the Government Affairs Committee. He is also on the ASLA Florida Chapter Conference Committee and has served on the ASLA Florida Executive Committee since 2014. In 2023, Kevin received the ASLA Florida Service Award and was presented with a Proclamation Award from the Secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.\nKevin believes his role with ASLA Florida and his professional experience as a landscape architect will be an asset in his work on the TPF board. He said he looks forward to engaging the community on behalf of TPF and promoting the foundation’s vision.\nJanuary 23, 2025\nPosted in\nPark News\n,\nTPF News\nSearch for:\nRecent Posts\nRecent Posts\nTimucuan Parks Foundation Hosts Multiple Youth Groups as part of its Summer Outdoor Explorations Program\nTimucuan Parks Foundation and JaxParks need Volunteers to clean up Kathryn Abbey Hanna Park after Labor Day\nTimucuan Parks Foundation and Boeing Partner for Park Programming and Environmental Stewardship\nFourth Annual 7 Creeks Fest Set for Saturday, March 8\nTimucuan Parks Foundation Welcomes Kevin White to its Board of Directors\nGet News & Updates\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nTimucuan Parks Foundation\n(904) 374-1107\n|\n[email protected]\nPO Box 351203, Jacksonville, FL 32235\n9953 Heckscher Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32226\nFollow on Facebook\nFollow on Twitter\nFollow on Instagram\nFollow on LinkedIn\nFollow on Youtube\nTimucuan Parks Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.

We keep these natural and historical environments protected, valued and celebrated. We are all stewards of the Timucuan Parks.\nThe Northeast Florida community has greatly benefited from true visionaries who have made our city the home of the largest urban park system in America. These extraordinary parks and preserves will be here forever, if a passionate, engaged group of friends cares about the parks, supports the parks, and spends quality time in the parks.\nBecome A Member\nTimucuan Parks Foundation\nHistory and Origins\nOur origins date back to 1999, when Mayor John Delaney announced the “Preservation Project Jacksonville.” It was one of the most vigorous land acquisition programs ever undertaken in Northeast Florida. Its primary goal was to identify and acquire Duval County’s most vulnerable, environmentally sensitive lands in order to protect and preserve these lands as development began stretching into the rural areas.\nAs the land acquisition progressed, the City of Jacksonville, the National Park Service and the Florida State Parks formed an unprecedented tri-governmental partnership, connecting federal, state and local public lands, ultimately creating the largest urban park system (80,000+ acres) in the contiguous United States.\nAlso named “Preservation Project Jacksonville,” our non-profit organization’s role was to be the intermediary between the landowners and the government agencies, as the transaction process could be quite lengthy. This was our primary role from 1999 to approximately 2009, with the end goal of becoming the primary support organization for our parks and park partners.\nIn January 2010, our board recognized our parks now needed an active support group and it was time to move from “acquisition” to “activation.” We changed our name to the “Timucuan Trail Parks Foundation” and our mission to preserve, promote and protect the Timucuan parks through fundraising, marketing and advocacy. In 2015, our name was simplified to “Timucuan Parks Foundation” as we move forward with promoting a stewardship ethic for the parks, supporting our park partners, and telling the story.\nWe are committed to support our city, state and national parks through raising local and national awareness and in telling the historical story of North Florida. We have only begun to understand and appreciate the richness and immensity of the history of the indigenous people who lived and thrived here thousands of years ago. We are excited and eager to share the secrets and treasures that have been discovered and to uncover those that are waiting to be discovered.\nPhotos by:\nwww.willdickey.com\nPark Partners\nWe Invite You to Become a Friend of the Parks\nBecome A Friend\nCorporate and Community Partners\nCommunity Volunteer Partners\nTimucuan Parks Foundation gratefully acknowledges these groups for their community service and partnership!\nABB Group, Inc.\nAmerican Heritage Girls\nBoy Scout Troop 37, Atlantic Beach\nDowntown Rotoract\nErnst & Young (EY)\nFirst Coast Rotoract\nFriends of Talbot Islands State Parks\nHawkers Neptune Beach\nNorth Florida Trailblazers, Florida Trail Association\nNortheast Florida Sierra Club\nUNF Institute of Environmental Research and Education\nYoga4Change\nAnd more!\nTimucuan Parks Foundation is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.\nDonations are tax-deductible.
