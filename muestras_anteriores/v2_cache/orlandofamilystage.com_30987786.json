Young people are encouraged to connect with our shows and stories by creating unique visual art pieces that are put on display for all patrons to enjoy!\nThis year an Orlando Family Stage partnered with\nArtWorks Orlando\n, a visual arts nonprofit organization dedicated to providing children the creative opportunities to express themselves through a variety of art mediums. Projects are designed to encourage introspective thought and healing, enhance cultural pride, and build self esteem. In preparation to see the show\nDragons Love Tacos\n, ArtWorks Orlando worked alongside 3rd and 4th grade students at Maxey Elementary School to create colorful, taco-loving dragons.\nEach student chose colors for their dragon picked its wing shape, and designed its other body parts and accessories. The dragon’s skin was created with decoupaged tissue paper. Body parts and accessories were cut from construction paper. Once assembled, the dragon was placed on a watercolor background painted by the student.\nPlease enjoy this artwork created by these students and get your tickets for the family-friendly\nDragons Love Tacos the Musical\n!\nStudent design process!\nStudent renderings!\nBLOG CTA\nExperience the\nMagic of Theatre\nDon't miss out on the magic.

I always had a passion for how theater has the ability to entertain and inspire people, and being a part of that process was something that intrigued and inspired me.\nWhat kind of education or experience prepared you for this career?\nMy initial professional experience was focused on live sports events, which definitely helped prepare me for a career in theater. There are a lot of similarities between live sporting events and theater, including marketing, ticket sales, budgeting, and of course, the magic of the live event.\nWhat school subjects that our students may be studying do you use everyday?\nI am a big believer in the importance of communication related classes. I feel that public speaking and writing classes are very important.\nCan you describe your role as a producer? How do you help make the production happen?\nThough every production is different, my role usually includes building a team that is tailored to the specific needs of the production, and then helping to support those individuals throughout the entire process.\nThis is a brand new adaptation of the\nCharlie Brown Christmas\nstory! What excites you about this updated version of the story?\nI am particularly excited to watch the ultra- talented professionals at Orlando Family Stage put their spin on such classic and timeless production.  I can’t wait to see the amazing Orlando actors, as well as the important contributions of the designers, artistic staff, crew, stage management and everyone else at Orlando Family Stage who helped to create this production.\nCharlie Brown feels sad during the play. When you are feeling sad, how do you help yourself feel better? How do you help your friends feel better if they are sad?\nIf I feel sad, I find it always helps make me feel better when I am surrounded by family.  And of course the best thing would be to see an upbeat fun musical with my family!\nLinus says that the tree Charlie Brown got ‘just needed a little love.’ What have you made better by giving a little love?\nHopefully my two smart, beautiful, creative daughters, though I guess you’d have to ask them.\nThis production will tour around the country this holiday season. What is different about your work on a touring show than a show that just performs in one city?\nThe key components to both types of productions are very similar in terms of needing talented professionals who work closely together as a team.  In terms of comparing tours and shows that only perform in one city, the biggest difference is that the venues are different every night including the stage, wings, backstage, etc., so the entire team needs to be flexible and adapt as needed in each venue.\nWhat are three words you would use to describe this production?\nFriendship.  Fun. Memorable.\nTodd Gershwin is a successful producer and entertainment executive with a diverse background in music, theater, marketing and live events. Todd is currently the CEO of\nGershwin Entertainment Corporation\n, which develops and produces successful theatrical productions, concerts and tours for numerous iconic brands. Touring projects have included A Charlie Brown Christmas, Tony Award winning Broadway hit musical Million Dollar Quartet, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer the Musical, American Rhapsody, the Golden Age of Broadway and A Night With Janis Joplin. Gershwin’s productions have played at leading venues throughout North America such as Madison Square Garden, Ravinia, Wolftrap, multiple Broadway theaters, Arena Stage, the Seattle’s 5th Avenue Theater and the Pasadena Playhouse.\nPrevious theatrical projects include the international musical hit An American in Paris, Born for This with gospel superstar BeBe Winans, ‘S Wonderful, Here to Stay, and the Tony award winning family spectacular Blast. Todd has also produced a number of recorded media projects including the Broadway cast album of A Night With Janis Joplin with famed music producer Russ Titelman and an all-star recording project with the late legendary music producer Phil Ramone.\nTodd spent three years as the Director of Marketing and Events at St. John’s University, where he managed relationships with key institutional partners such as Madison Square Garden, Nike, Pepsi, and Gatorade.\nTodd graduated with a B.A. in Management & Communications from the University of Michigan, which awarded him with its Alumni Career Achievement Award. Todd lives in Rye, New York with his wife and two daughters.\nBLOG CTA\nExperience the\nMagic of Theatre\nDon't miss out on the magic.

These appearances underscore the organization’s dedication to leadership and innovation in theatre for young audiences.\n“As one of the nation’s top 10 theatres for young audiences, we take our position as a leader in the field seriously,” said Chris Brown, Executive Director of Orlando Family Stage. “We are thrilled to see our staff recognized for their outstanding work and excited for the opportunity to share our ideas and successes with peers across the country.”\nCrafting Stories for Families: Artistic Director Jeff Revels at BroadwayCon\nOn February 7, Artistic Director Jeff Revels will take the stage at the 10th annual BroadwayCon, held in New York City,  joining a panel that delves into the art of creating original theatre for family audiences.\n“It is an honor to share the work we do at Orlando Family Stage with peers at BroadwayCon,” said Revels. “I want this particular audience to understand how important theatres outside of New York City can be to the development of new shows and to think about partnering with a regional theatre on their road to Broadway. The family audience is a very important audience and one that easily is misunderstood by well-intentioned creators. Theatres like ours can help with that.”\nRevels will share insights on developing productions that captivate audiences of all ages, from whimsical storytelling to thoughtful choreography. The discussion will explore how to balance entertainment with meaningful themes, keep content fresh and accessible, and craft shows that resonate with children and adults alike.\nElevating Arts Education: Stacie Perez at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Partners in Education Annual Meeting\nFebruary brings another moment of recognition for Orlando Family Stage, as Stacie Perez, Director of Arts-Based Learning, presents at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for the Partners in Education Annual Meeting. Perez will highlight the organization’s impactful partnership with Orange County Public Schools, which provides exceptional professional development in arts integration and arts education to local teachers.\n“Our partnership with Orange County Public Schools is a true testament to the transformative power of arts education,” said Perez. “I am so excited to share how our professional development programs, specifically in the realm of arts integration, have grown and evolved over the last few years. Our unique model has become a popular one here in Central Florida and being able to present this work at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. is a wonderful opportunity to share, inspire, and be inspired by the collective work happening across the country.”\nAs an Advisory Board Member in the Partners in Education program, Perez works as a liaison between the Kennedy Center and other program partners, with a focus on the South Atlantic Region.\nThis annual meeting gathers nearly 100 arts organizations and school districts from over 40 states to share ideas and best practices in arts integration. Perez’s presentation will illustrate how Orlando Family Stage fosters meaningful connections between schools and the arts to empower teachers, engage students, and enrich curriculum from all subject areas.\nSupporting Teen Mental Wellness Through Theatre: Emily Freeman at the TYA/USA National Festival & Conference\nIn May, Emily Freeman, Senior Director of Development, will team up with Elisabeth Brendel Horn, Associate Professor of Theatre at the University of Central Florida, to present “Mind Matters: New Plays and Drama-Based Curriculum to Promote Mental Wellness in Teens” at the TYA/USA National Festival & Conference in Washington, D.C. TYA/USA is the leading national organization for the professional field of theatre for children and families.\n“Mental health is such a critical issue for teens today, and I am proud to be part of a project that uses theatre as a platform for understanding and dialogue,” said Freeman. Mind Matters was created to help educators and students navigate these important conversations in a safe and creative way. It is a privilege to present this work alongside Elisabeth Brendel Horn and to highlight the innovative collaboration between Orlando Family Stage and UCF.”\nTheir presentation will focus on Pieces of Mind, a collection of short plays addressing mental health, and the accompanying Mind Matters curriculum guide, which equips educators with tools to explore these topics in classrooms and onstage. Developed in collaboration with UCF’s psychology department and supported by the Pabst Steinmetz Foundation Arts and Wellness Innovation Award, this innovative program exemplifies the power of theatre to foster dialogue and build empathy.\nA Legacy of Leadership and Creativity\nThe national recognition of Orlando Family Stage’s staff underscores the organization’s mission to empower young people to be brave and empathetic through theatre. These speaking engagements highlight the organization’s creative and educational impact, as well as its role in shaping the future of theatre for young audiences.\n###\nABOUT ORLANDO FAMILY STAGE\nOrlando Family Stage is one of the nation’s largest professional theatres for young audiences and the only one in Florida dedicated exclusively to children and families.

Young people are encouraged to connect with our shows and stories by creating unique visual art pieces that are put on display for all patrons to enjoy!\nStudents from Ms. Diane Lovett’s visual art classes at\nPoinciana Academy of Fine Arts\nin Osceola County worked on creating a variety of scenes inspired from the show\nA Charlie Brown Christmas: Live On Stage\n. Students across all grade levels participated in this project ranging from Kindergarten through 5\nth\ngrade. The 5\nth\ngraders captured the essence of the ice-skating pond scene, while 4th graders designed costumes for the cast after watching the show with their drama teacher. The 3\nrd\ngraders were inspired by Snoopy’s house and created their own “Snoopy Home” decorated for the holiday season. The 2\nnd\nand 1\nst\ngraders worked to share their wish lists for Santa just like Sally. The Kindergarteners used their hands to create and decorate their very own Charlie Brown Christmas Trees. Out of all the art projects created, 23 were selected to be displayed in the Edyth Bush Lobby at Orlando Family Stage.\nPlease enjoy this artwork created by students at\nPoinciana Academy of Fine Arts and get your tickets for our family-friendly production of\nA Charlie Brown Christmas: Live On Stage\nhere\n!\nBLOG CTA\nExperience the\nMagic of Theatre\nDon't miss out on the magic.

Young people are encouraged to connect with our shows and stories by creating unique visual art pieces that are put on display for all patrons to enjoy!\nThis year an Orlando Family Stage partnered with\nArtWorks Orlando\n, a visual arts nonprofit organization dedicated to providing children the creative opportunities to express themselves through a variety of art mediums. Projects are designed to encourage introspective thought and healing, enhance cultural pride, and build self-esteem. In preparation to see the show\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid\n, ArtWorks Orlando worked alongside teens at\nEdgewood Children’s Ranch\n, who role played being art directors and writers at the imaginary “ArtWorks Advertising Agency”. They were tasked with designing campaign posters for the yearbook superlatives at the middle school where Greg Heffley (aka: Wimpy Kid) is a student.\nEach teen art director/writer received a creative brief that provided pertinent information about the student/client whose poster they would create. The teens brainstormed headlines and slogans for their poster, chose the best ones, and then created thumbnail sketches of possible poster designs. A poster design was chosen and the final design was enlarged to create the full-size poster.\nPlease enjoy this artwork created by these young creative artists and see their work on display when you come to this family-friendly musical,\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid the Musical\n!\nBLOG CTA\nExperience the\nMagic of Theatre\nDon't miss out on the magic.
