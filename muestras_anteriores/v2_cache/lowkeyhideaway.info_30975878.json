His innovative approach to entertainment has brought a fresh and exciting atmosphere to the Low-Key Hideaway & Tiki Bar since 2022, infusing the venue with his unique flair for creativity.\n​\nScott and Carrie arrived in Cedar Key during a road trip in January 2022. They stopped by the Low-Key Hideaway & Tiki Bar and by the end of the weekend, Scott had purchased the establishment with just a handshake. They returned in March 2022 to take over, and the rest is history!\n​\nOver the years, Low-Key Hideaway has endured the wrath of multiple storms—including Hurricane Debbie, Hurricane Idalia, and most recently, Hurricane Helene. After Idalia caused extensive damage to the motel, Scott saw an opportunity to remodel the units and refresh the property. Tragically, Hurricane Helene followed and washed away everything that had just been redone. Despite these setbacks, Scott has remained committed to restoring and reimagining one of Cedar Key's most iconic venues.\n​\nLow-Key Hideaway has long been a standout in our charming town, and we’re excited about what the future holds.
