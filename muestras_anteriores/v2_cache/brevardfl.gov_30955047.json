Emergency Management is part of the Public Safety Group of the county government, reporting to the Board of County Commissioners through the Director of Public Safety and the County Manager's Office.\nOur Mission\nTo provide Brevard County residents, businesses and industries, non-profit organizations, and local governments the education and support necessary to reduce the loss of life and human suffering; to minimize property damage; and to protect environmentally sensitive areas from all types of disasters through a comprehensive, risk-based, all-hazard emergency management program.\nHow to Receive Emergency Alerts in Brevard County\nAlertBrevard Notifications\nIf you register phone numbers and / or email addresses with AlertBrevard, you can receive automated notifications about boil-water notices, shelter-in-place or evacuation orders, law enforcement activity, etc. for your area.\nThese are based on the address you provide, such as your home, business, or elderly parent's home. You may choose a telephone call, text message and / or email delivery methods.\nTo register, click on \"Alert Signup\" using the blue task bar above.\nThis system is used by emergency management, Brevard County Sherrif's Office, and local police and utility departments.\nWireless Emergency Alerts\nThese are sent to your cell phone and bounce off the cell towers only in a certain / affected area for:\nWeather-related alerts issued by the National Weather Service\nAmber Alerts (missing children) issued by law enforcement\nOther imminent threats to life or safety issued by Emergency Management\nAlerts issued by the President\nThese alerts look like a short text message and have a unique tone and vibration; you do not need to sign up for them; they are automatically enabled. All cell phones with Wireless Emergency Alerts enabled will receive alerts issued for the designated area, per their GPS location, even if they are visiting from another area.\nSocial Media\nIf you select \"See First\" on Brevard County Emergency Management's Facebook page, our posts will show up at the top of your news feed when you log in or open the app.\nFollow us on\nFacebook\nand\nTwitter\nat BrevardEOC.\nText message (text BREVARDEOC to 888777)\nNextDoor is also utilized by Brevard County Emergency Management to notify the public of immediate threats to their safety. Because everyone in Brevard County who signs up for NextDoor automatically receives our posts, we use it sparingly.\nWith social media, you'll see emergency messages, Emergency Operations Center activations (often due to space launches), general preparedness tips, and information about major road closures and prescribed burns. These are not based on your location.\nBe Prepared\nPreparation is a year-round activity, and you can help those around you be prepared in the event of a disaster, by following these steps.\n1\nKnow Your Risk\nThe first step to understanding risk in our community is to learn about the potential hazards.\n2\nBuild a Kit\nA disaster supply kit is a collection of essential items your household may need in the event of an emergency.\n3\nHave a Plan\nHaving a plan for what to do in the event of an emergency is the most important step you can take.\n4\nStay Informed\nThere are several tools available in Brevard County to stay informed during an emergency situation or disaster.\n5\nGet Involved\nA trained, informed, and engaged public is the best way to empower individuals to lend support. There are many ways to get involved so you can make a positive difference.\nTypes of Hazards\nThe first step to understanding risk in our community is to learn about the potential hazards.\nCivil Disorder\nExtreme Cold\nExtreme Heat\nFlooding\nHazardous Materials\nLaunch Anomaly\nNuclear Accident\nStorm Surge\nTerrorism\nTornados\nTropical Cyclones\nTsunami\nWildfire\nAlert Signup\nBe Prepared\nStep 1: Know Your Risk\nStep 2: Build a Kit\nStep 3: Have a Plan\nStep 4: Stay Informed\nStep 5: Get Involved\nMitigation\nPublic Safety Radio\nAbout Us\nSignal Boosters\nTower Request\nRecovery\nResponse\nRequest an Emergency Operations Center Tour\nRequest a Presentation\n9-1-1 Administration\nAbout 9-1-1 Administration\nAddress Assignment\nHistory\nLinks\nText to 9-1-1\nWireless\nStreet Address Guide\nLinks of Interest\nOnline Payment\nSpecial Needs\nHealthcare Facility Plans\nBrevard County Emergency Management Office\nPhone\n(321) 637-6670\nFax\n(321) 633-1738\nEmail\nBrevard.EOC@BrevardFL.gov\nLocation\n1751 Huntington Lane\nRockledge, FL 32955\nSocial Media Channels\nBrevard County Board of County Commissioners\n2725 Judge Fran Jamieson Way\nViera, FL 32940\nQuick Links\nADA Notice\nCounty Webmail\nEmployee Central\nPrivacy\nLegal Ads and Public Notices\nUsing Our Site\nSitemap\nSign Up\nJoin our mailing list to stay up to date and get the latest Press Releases and Newsletters\nSubscribe Now\nContact Us\n(800)-955-8771\n711 FLORIDA RELAY\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrevardCo_FL\" class=\"socialT\" aria-label=\"Brevard County Twitter Feed\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"fab fa-twitter fa-inverse\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></em></a>\nUsability Survey\n© 2025 Brevard County.

Program\nLand Management and Restoration\nEnvironmentally Endangered Lands Program Land Management\nTree Density Reduction in Florida Scrub-Jay Habitat at Malabar Scrub Sanctuary\nThe EEL Program will be furthering its efforts to improve the habitat conditions for the Florida Scrub-Jay at the Malabar Scrub Sanctuary. This work will involve the removal of trees where habitat conditions are not suitable\n        to support scrub-jay populations. The Florida Scrub-Jay requires an open landscape of low scrub-oak vegetation and reasonably open adjacent pine flatwoods in order to maintain food resources and breeding success.\nBuying lands for conservation\n    requires a pledge to long-term land management. For centuries, natural cycles of fire, water flow, and weather shaped the habitats we see today. Now roads, development, and other human disturbances have fragmented the landscape. These natural cycles\n    can no longer happen on their own, and it is up to land managers to re-create them to preserve our unique species and habitats. Examples of land management activities include: securing property boundaries, implementing prescribed fires, removing invasive\n    plants, restoring hydrological cycles, and creating public access trails. These practices maintain healthy sanctuaries and often restore areas that have been disturbed or neglected. A land manager can be thought of as a doctor for the land, curing\n    ailments and maintaining overall health.\nThe goals and approaches for management of\nEEL\nsanctuaries are outlined in the\nEEL\nSanctuary Management Manual.\npdf\nLand Acquisition Manual (\npdf\n,\n9151 KB\n)\nThe\nEEL\nSelection & Management Committee (EEL SMC) plays a very important role in helping the\nEEL\nProgram conserve land in Brevard County. The Board of County Commissioners selects the eight member volunteer committee based on their scientific knowledge\n    and experience. Seven members are scientists and one represents ecotourism interests, and all live and work in Brevard County, and have years of experience working with the issues facing Brevard's natural areas. It is the\nEEL\nSMC\njob to choose sites\n    that the\nEEL\nProgram will acquire and protect. Only lands that are recommended by the\nEEL\nSMC\ncan be bought with\nEEL\nfunds.\nWhen the\nEEL\nSMC\nmakes a decision about whether to acquire a piece of land, they base their choice on scientific criteria they developed. These criteria are outlined in the\nEEL\nLand Acquisition Manual (PDF). The\nEEL\nSMC\nselects lands for acquisition one of two ways. Either the committee evaluates lands presented to them by private landowners to see if the land meets the\nEEL\ncriteria. Or, the committee identifies lands that meet the criteria for acquisition\n    and staff then contacts the landowners to determine if they are willing sellers.\nThe\nEEL\nProgram is currently focused on acquiring land within the Brevard Coastal Scrub Ecosystem project, which targets scrub and related habitats throughout Brevard. A second area for acquisition is within the North Indian River Lagoon Blueways project,\n    which targets lands in North Brevard County to protect the headwaters of the Indian River Lagoon. The\nEEL\nSMC\nwill consider acquisition of land outside these project areas if the land meets the\nEEL\ncriteria for acquisition.\nNorth Region\nSuperintendent: Damien Keene\nPhone: (321) 264-5185\nEmail:\nDamien.Keene@BrevardFL.gov\nBuck Lake Conservation Area\nDicerandra Scrub Sanctuary\nEnchanted Forest Sanctuary\nFox Lake Sanctuary\nIndian Mound Station Sanctuary\nScottsmoor Flatwoods Sanctuary East\nScottsmoor Flatwoods Sanctuary West\nSouth Lake Conservation Area\nCentral Region\nSuperintendent: David DeMeyer\nPhone: (321) 449-4720\nEmail:\nDavid.DeMeyer@BrevardFL.gov\nHelen and Allan Cruickshank Sanctuary\nPine Island Conservation Area\nSams House at Pine Island\nThousand Island Conservation Area\nUlumay Sanctuary\nSouth Region\nSuperintendent: Steve McGuffy\nPhone: (321) 255-4466\nEmail:\nSteve.McGuffey@BrevardFL.gov\nCrane Creek Sanctuary\nGrant Flatwoods Sanctuary\nJordan Scrub Sanctuary\nMalabar Scrub Sanctuary\nMicco Scrub Sanctuary\nSouth Beaches Region\nSuperintendent: Ray Mojica\nPhone: (321) 255-4466\nEmail:\nRaymond.Mojica@BrevardParks.com\nBarrier Island Sanctuary\nCoconut Point Sanctuary\nMaritime Hammock Sanctuary\nAdvisory Committee\nPublications\nEducation\nEducation Centers\nPreservation\nImperiled Scrub Ecosystem\nEEL Program FAQs\nEEL Recreation Guide\nRecreation Guide\nGeocaching\nLand Management and Restoration\nEEL Program Press Releases\nSanctuaries\nDoc Ehrhart Sanctuary\nCoconut Point Sanctuary\nCrane Creek Sanctuary\nDicerandra Scrub Sanctuary\nEnchanted Forest Sanctuary\nFox Lake Sanctuary\nGrant Flatwoods Sanctuary\nHelen and Allan Cruickshank Sanctuary\nIndian Mound Station Sanctuary\nJordan Scrub Sanctuary\nMalabar Scrub Sanctuary\nMaritime Hammock Sanctuary\nMicco Scrub Sanctuary\nNorth Buck Lake Scrub Sanctuary\nPine Island Conservation Area\nSams House at Pine Island\nScottsmoor Flatwoods Sanctuary East\nScottsmoor Flatwoods Sanctuary West\nSouth Lake Conservation Area\nThousand Islands Conservation Area\nUlumay Sanctuary\nVolunteer Opportunities\nTreasure Coin Hunt\nProgram Calendar\nEnvironmentally Endangered Lands Program Administrative Office\nPhone\n(321) 255-4466\nFax\n(321) 255-4499\nEmail\nMike.Knight@BrevardFL.gov\nEEL-Info@BrevardParks.com\nLocation\n91 East Drive\nMelbourne, FL 32904\nSocial Media Channels\nBrevard County Board of County Commissioners\n2725 Judge Fran Jamieson Way\nViera, FL 32940\nQuick Links\nADA Notice\nCounty Webmail\nEmployee Central\nPrivacy\nLegal Ads and Public Notices\nUsing Our Site\nSitemap\nSign Up\nJoin our mailing list to stay up to date and get the latest Press Releases and Newsletters\nSubscribe Now\nContact Us\n(800)-955-8771\n711 FLORIDA RELAY\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrevardCo_FL\" class=\"socialT\" aria-label=\"Brevard County Twitter Feed\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"fab fa-twitter fa-inverse\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></em></a>\nUsability Survey\n© 2025 Brevard County.

Control\nPrevention and Control\nMosquito Prevention and Control (DEET Information)\nDEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide)\nformerly known as N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide is a versatile and effective insect repellent. Insect repellents containing DEET have been used for more than 40 years by millions of people worldwide to repel mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, biting flies and chiggers. These products are available in many formulations, including lotions, creams, gels, aerosol and pump sprays, and towelettes.\nInsect repellents containing DEET can reduce the risk of mosquito and tick bites, when used properly.\nHow do DEET and other repellents work?\nMosquitoes and other blood-feeding flies (such as black flies and deer flies) are attracted to hosts by skin odors and carbon dioxide from their breath. When a mosquito gets close to a host, DEET and some other repellents jam the insect's sensors and\n    confuse the insect so it is unable to land and bite the host successfully. Repellents are effective only at short distances from the treated surface, so the user may still see mosquitoes flying nearby. As long as the user is not getting bitten, there\n    is no reason to apply more DEET.\nRead and follow instructions on the label and avoid excessive use and over-application.\nFor casual use by most people, a high concentration of DEET is not needed. Products with 25 percent to 35 percent DEET will provide adequate protection for adults under most conditions; use lower concentrations for children.\nTo make sure you will not react to the repellent, apply the product to a small area of skin on your arm or leg before general use.\nUse just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.\nAfter returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water. Wash treated clothing before wearing again.\nDo not spray directly on face; spray the repellent onto hands and then apply to face.\nAvoid sensitive areas like the eyes, mouth and nasal membranes.\nDo not apply over cuts, wounds or irritated skin.\nDo not use under clothing.\nAvoid spraying on plastics (such as watch crystals and eyeglasses frames), rayon, spandex, other synthetic fabrics, leather and painted or varnished surfaces because DEET can damage those surfaces.\nDo not spray DEET- containing products in enclosed areas.\nDo not spray repellents while smoking, repellents are flammable.\nDEET products will usually repel mosquitoes for several hours, so it is not necessary to reapply the repellent more frequently than that.\nDEET products will NOT repel stinging insects such as wasps and bees.\nUsing DEET repellents on children?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends: Always follow the recommendations appearing on the product label when using repellent:\nWhen using repellent on a child, apply it to your own hands and then rub them on your child. Avoid children's eyes and mouth and use it sparingly around their ears.\nDo not apply repellent to children's hands. (Children may tend to put their hands in their mouths).\nDo not allow young children to apply insect repellent to themselves; have an adult do it for them.\nKeep repellents out of reach of children.\nDo not apply repellent under clothing. If repellent is applied to clothing, wash treated clothing before wearing again. (May vary by product, check label for specific instructions).\nHow does the percent of DEET in a product relate to the amount of protection it gives?\nBased on recent studies:\nA product containing 23.8% DEET provides an average of 5 hours of protection from mosquito bites.\nA product containing 20% DEET provided almost 4 hours of protection.\nA product containing 6.65% DEET provided almost 2 hours of protection.\nA product containing 4.75% DEET and 2% soybean oil were both able to provide roughly 1 and a half-hours of protection.\nWhat should I do if I have medical questions about DEET?\nIf you suspect that you or your child is reacting to an insect repellent, discontinue use, wash the treated skin and call your physician or local poison control center. If you go to a hospital or doctor, take the repellent with you.\nThe Florida Poison information center number:\n1-800-222-1222\nAdditional information about the active ingredients in repellents and other pesticides may be obtained from:\nNational Pesticide Information Center (NPIC0)\n1-800-858-7378\n8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (central time)\nseven days a week.\nOr visit the\nNational Pesticide Information Center website\n.\nCan I use a repellent that does not contain DEET?\nIf you do not want to use a product containing DEET, or if your physician advises you to avoid DEET, there are other products that give you limited protection. These repellents generally use plant-based oils to repel insects. In comparison to DEET based\n    products, plant oil-based repellents are generally effective for a shorter time (usually less than about two hours).\nNote: Vitamin B, ultrasonic devices and incense have not been shown to be effective in preventing mosquito bites.\nWhat about treating clothes with repellents containing permethrin?\nSome people use permethrin on clothing to repel ticks, mites and mosquitoes. Permethrin repellents should NEVER be applied to skin: they are to be used on clothing ONLY. Always use permethrin repellents according to the label instructions.\nWhen permethrin products are applied to clothing, the spray should be allowed to dry before clothing is worn.\nPermethrin works mainly by killing ticks that come in contact with treated clothes.\nBecause treating clothing with permethrin is particularly effective against ticks, they reduce the risk of getting Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other diseases by preventing tick bites.\nPermethrin is a pesticide and exposure should be minimized. Therefore, it should only be used when ticks or mosquitoes are numerous and other protective measures are not practical or available.\nAre there other ways to help prevent insect bites?\nThe use of an insect repellent is not the only way to reduce the risk of bites from mosquitoes, ticks and other biting insects that may transmit disease.\nOther precautions are important as well:\nAvoid places and times when mosquitoes bite. Generally, the peak biting periods occur just before and after sunset and again just before dawn.\nPlease contact Brevard County Mosquito Control for a site visit to assess possible breeding sites on your property by phone or online at\nCustomer Service Form\n.\nHorse Owners\nPrevention and Control\nServices Provided\nTips for the Home\nWest Nile Virus\nLinks of Interest\nSpray Area\nCustomer Feedback Form\nMosquito Control\nPhone (North of Wickham Rd.)\n(321) 264-5032\nPhone (South of Wickham Rd.)\n(321) 952-4523\nEmail\nMosquitoControlWebContact@BrevardFL.gov\nLocation\n800 Perimeter Road\nTitusville, FL 32780\nBrevard County Board of County Commissioners\n2725 Judge Fran Jamieson Way\nViera, FL 32940\nQuick Links\nADA Notice\nCounty Webmail\nEmployee Central\nPrivacy\nLegal Ads and Public Notices\nUsing Our Site\nSitemap\nSign Up\nJoin our mailing list to stay up to date and get the latest Press Releases and Newsletters\nSubscribe Now\nContact Us\n(800)-955-8771\n711 FLORIDA RELAY\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrevardCo_FL\" class=\"socialT\" aria-label=\"Brevard County Twitter Feed\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"fab fa-twitter fa-inverse\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></em></a>\nUsability Survey\n© 2025 Brevard County.

Development Office\nTourist Development Council\nBrevard County Tourist Development Council\nThe Brevard County Tourist Development Council (TDC) was established to promote growth, development, and quality of tourism on the Space Coast.  The\nTDC\nacts as the primary body to determine direction,\r\n    goals and policy for use of the tourism tax. The Tourist Development Tax (TDT), also known as the \"bed tax\", currently adds a 5% tax to\nshort-term rentals\n(six months or less) of hotels, motels, apartment hotels, rooming houses, RV\r\n    parks, and condominiums in Brevard County.\nThe\nTDC\nconsists of nine (9) members appointed by the County Commission in accordance with a formula established by Florida Statute. The current members of the council are listed below. One member is the\r\n    County Commission Chair or his/her designee. Two represent municipal governments in the county.

It serves\r\n    the nearly 640,000 residents of Brevard County including the following\r\n    municipalities and communities: Aurantia, Barefoot Bay, Canaveral Groves, Cape\r\n    Canaveral, Cocoa, Cocoa Beach, Eau Gallie, Floridana Beach, Georgianna,\r\n    Grant-Valkaria, Indialantic, Indian Harbour Beach, Malabar, Melbourne,\r\n    Melbourne Beach, Melbourne Shores, Melbourne Village, Merritt Island, Micco,\r\n    Mims, Patrick Space Force Base, Palm Bay, Palm Shores, Pineda, Port St. John,\r\n    Rockledge, Satellite Beach, Scottsmoor, Sharpes, South Patrick, Suntree, Titusville,\r\n    Viera, as well as local visitors from Orlando, Daytona, Vero Beach and tourists\r\n    from outside the state.\nBrevard County is a popular\ntourism\nsite\r\n with points of interest including the\nBrevard Zoo\n, the\nArchie\r\n Carr National Wildlife Refuge\n,\nCanaveral National Seashore\n,\nMerritt\r\n Island National Wildlife Refuge\n,\nPort Canaveral\n, the\r\n    Space Coast Stadium,\nPatrick\r\n Space Force Base (PSFB)\n, and\nKennedy\r\n Space Center (KSC)\n-- with many parks well suited for viewing\r\n    space vehicle launches. Any resident or tourist visiting Brevard will find that\r\n    Brevard County parks offer a rich opportunity for leisure activity and\r\n    environmental education.\nCore Value 2: Achievement\nOf the many parks and facilities\r\navailable throughout the county, those that the Department manages include 106 parks, 3 campgrounds, 3 nature centers, 3 education centers, 15 community centers, 1 cultural center, 1 veterans center, 87 beach accesses, 10 school athletic sites, and 21 Environmentally Endangered Land sanctuaries and conservation areas. The Parks\r\nand Recreation Department's website offers residents and visitors a place to\r\ndiscover the unique features and recreational opportunities available\r\nthroughout our parks.\nCore Value 3: Respect for Nature\nExtending 72 miles along\r\nFlorida's Atlantic coast and inland up to 20 miles to the St. Johns River,\r\nBrevard County is represented by a wide variety of natural resources,\r\nvegetation, and wildlife species. Three predominant geographic features create\r\ndistinct environments: the Indian River Lagoon, the coastal ridge with its pine\r\nand oak forests, and the St. Johns River valley with its wet and dry prairies.\r\nThe most renowned is the Indian River Lagoon surrounding Merritt Island and\r\nseparated from the Atlantic Ocean by a barrier peninsula. This lagoon is\r\nAmerica's most diverse estuary system with more than 4,300 kinds of plants and\r\nanimals. From the vast savannas of the St. Johns to the dunes and maritime\r\nhammocks along the coast, from open pine lands to hardwood oak forests, Brevard\r\nCounty's park system preserves Florida's natural features to be experienced and\r\nappreciated, while providing access to a variety of recreational opportunities.\nMany\r\ncounty parks in Brevard preserve the sensitive ecosystem and include endangered\r\nlands and threatened species. Educational programs at nature centers focus on\r\nawareness of the outdoors and preservation of the environment which includes\r\nthe unique\nIndian\r\nRiver Lagoon\n, the St. Johns River, lakes, wetlands, maritime\r\nhammocks and scrub. Specific parks are a haven for bird watching and provide a\r\nsanctuary for many bird communities including the osprey, eagle, egret,\r\npelican, and various wildlife including sea turtles and manatees.\nCore Value 4: Good Health\nRecreational opportunities on\r\nFlorida's beautiful Space Coast range from nature preserves to state-of-the-art\r\nathletic facilities and active community centers. Features that inspire both\r\nactive and quiet pursuits include wildlife sanctuaries, beaches, rivers, lakes,\r\nboat ramps, nature centers, trails, cultural sites, an aquatic center,\r\nplaygrounds, event/picnic pavilions, and a variety of sports facilities.\nAdditionally,\r\nfor those who love the outdoors, Brevard County's parks provide venues for\r\ncommunity and regional activities including camping at three unique\r\ncampgrounds; horse trails; fishing and boating--with access to the waterways by\r\nboat ramps at many parks; beach and lake swimming and various venues for water\r\nsports including sailing, windsurfing, surfing, rowing, catamaran, canoe, and\r\nkayak.\nFacilities\r\nfor other active sports include softball, tennis, volleyball, horseshoes,\r\nshuffleboard, and there are many soccer and Little League ballfields. Picnic\r\npavilions and playgrounds are available at various parks for more passive\r\nenjoyment.\nAbout Parks\nAdvisory Boards\nAquatic Activities\nBusiness Self-Certification Registry\nCampgrounds\nLong Point Park\nManatee Hammock\nWickham Park\nCenters\nEnvironmentally Endangered Lands Program\nGolf Courses\nParks by City\nCape Canaveral\nCocoa\nCocoa Beach\nGrant-Valkaria\nIndialantic\nIndian Harbour Beach\nMelbourne\nMelbourne Beach\nMerritt Island\nMicco\nMims\nPort St. John\nRockledge\nScottsmoor\nSharpes\nSouth Patrick Shores\nTitusville\nViera\nWest Melbourne\nParks Calendar\nPark Directory\nPersons With Disabilities Programs\nPickleball\nPress Releases\nLinks of Interest\nBook a Campground\nProgram Registration\nRent a Facility\nFind a Park\nEEL Program\nBrevard County Parks and Recreation Department\nNorth Area Operations\nPhone\n(321) 264-5105\nEmail\nNorthAreaParks@BrevardFL.gov\nCentral Area Operations\nPhone\n(321) 633-1874\nEmail\nCentralAreaParks@BrevardFL.gov\nSouth Area Operations\nPhone\n(321) 255-4400\nEmail\nSouthAreaParks@BrevardFL.gov\nAdministration Office\nPhone\n(321) 633-2046\nFax\n(321) 633-2198\nEmail\nBrevardParks@BrevardFL.gov\nLocation\n2725 Judge Fran Jamieson Way\nViera, FL 32940\nSocial Media Channels\nBrevard County Board of County Commissioners\n2725 Judge Fran Jamieson Way\nViera, FL 32940\nQuick Links\nADA Notice\nCounty Webmail\nEmployee Central\nPrivacy\nLegal Ads and Public Notices\nUsing Our Site\nSitemap\nSign Up\nJoin our mailing list to stay up to date and get the latest Press Releases and Newsletters\nSubscribe Now\nContact Us\n(800)-955-8771\n711 FLORIDA RELAY\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrevardCo_FL\" class=\"socialT\" aria-label=\"Brevard County Twitter Feed\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"fab fa-twitter fa-inverse\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></em></a>\nUsability Survey\n© 2025 Brevard County.

Brevard Economic Development Zone\nAbout\nWhat is the North Brevard Economic Development Zone?\nThe North Brevard Economic Development Zone (NBEDZ, or \"Zone\"), created in July 2011 by the Brevard County Board of County Commissioners, is a Special Dependent District in the northern part of Brevard county established under Florida Statute, Chapter\n    200.\nView the North Brevard Economic Development Zone Special Dependent District page\nThe North Brevard Economic Development Zone was formed with the goal of facilitating job growth and economic development in North Brevard, in the wake of NASA's Space Shuttle program end in 2011.\nWhat areas make up the North Brevard Economic Development Zone?\nThe North Brevard Economic Development Zone geographic boundaries are contiguous with the County Commission District One, excluding those areas south of State Road 528 and the boundaries of the City of Cocoa.\nFig. 1 - The North Brevard Economic Development Zone geographic boundaries are contiguous with the County Commission District One, excluding those areas south of State Road 528 and the boundaries of the City of Cocoa.\nWhy is the North Brevard Economic Development Zone necessary?\nThe North Brevard area, like the rest of the central Florida region, has greatly benefited from the space industry. Even today, the aerospace sector remains a key part of the North Brevard local economy, with current employment at NASA's Kennedy Space\n    Center (KSC) near Titusville numbering above 8,000. However, unlike the rest of the county and region, and primarily because\nKSC\nconsumes such a large percentage of land, the North Brevard area faces several additional challenges:\nThe highest percentage of workers laid off from the Space Shuttle program are likely residents living within the northern portion of Brevard County.\nMore than 50% of the land in North Brevard is exempt from property taxes (as either Federal or state-owned conservation land, particularly along the St. John's River waterway), rendering what would be key commercial and industrial areas unavailable\n        for development.\nWhile the North Brevard area has 20% of the population (in large part due to NASA's on-going presence), it only has 10% of the County’s taxable value, due to the land development restrictions noted above.\nIn creating the North Brevard Economic Development Zone, the very clear objective of the\nBoard of County Commissioners\nwas to create a vehicle\n    dedicated specifically to facilitating job growth and economic development within North Brevard county. In the originating ordinance, the Board of County Commissioners made the following findings:\nThe projected reduction of launch operations at Kennedy Space Center combined with the general economic downturn affecting Florida in general and the \"space coast\" in particular has created a profound negative impact on the economy of North Brevard\n        County.\nAlthough still an active player in the local economy, the resulting employment reduction at NASA from 2008 to 2011 and the dampening of traditional economic activity and discourse require immediate implementation of economic development initiatives\n        in the general vicinity of the City of Titusville and the North Brevard community.\nTo be successful, effective economic development requires the establishment of dedicated funding mechanisms.\n\"The passage of the North Brevard Economic Development Zone provides the county with a strong incentive to bring and expand the business base in a part of our community that could use assistance. The approval of this development zone presents further\n    evidence that Brevard County is taking a proactive stance in attracting new business to the Space Coast.\"\n- Former Brevard County Board of County Commissioners Chairman Robin Fisher\nAbout\nPlan Goals and Programs\nStrategic Initiatives\nBoard Members\nLinks of Interest\nEconomic Data\nNorth Brevard Economic Development Zone\nPhone\n(321) 621-4713\nEmail\nTroy.Post@BrevardFL.gov\nLocation\n400 South Street\nSte 1A\nTitusville, FL 32780\nBrevard County Board of County Commissioners\n2725 Judge Fran Jamieson Way\nViera, FL 32940\nQuick Links\nADA Notice\nCounty Webmail\nEmployee Central\nPrivacy\nLegal Ads and Public Notices\nUsing Our Site\nSitemap\nSign Up\nJoin our mailing list to stay up to date and get the latest Press Releases and Newsletters\nSubscribe Now\nContact Us\n(800)-955-8771\n711 FLORIDA RELAY\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrevardCo_FL\" class=\"socialT\" aria-label=\"Brevard County Twitter Feed\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"fab fa-twitter fa-inverse\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></em></a>\nUsability Survey\n© 2025 Brevard County.
