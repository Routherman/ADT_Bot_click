Growing up in the family business– an Italian Trattoria in New York–Suzanne discovered her passion for cooking. Sunday dinners with pasta-filled family feasts, homemade breads, sweets and plenty of red wine were the heart and soul of the family affair.  Her mother’s epicurean style combined tradition with seasonal ingredients–steeped in generations of authentic Italian cuisine. By the age of 14, Perrotto was in the kitchen cooking and learning classic culinary techniques that are a part of her menus today; she was off and running and has never looked back…\nAfter graduating Le Cordon Bleu in Scottsdale, Arizona Perrotto launched her culinary career in many kitchens across the country including the Phoenician Resort, Wrigley Mansion, Country Club of North Carolina , Jupiter Beach Resort and Ibis Country Club. When the entrepreneurial spirit beckoned, Perrotto opened Brulé in downtown Delray Beach in 2008.\nAlways looking forward, Perrotto has set her sights on the newest addition to the Brulé family—Rose’s Daughter, American Trattoria.  Opening in Spring 2019, Rose’s Daughter will be a fresh take on authentic American Italian cuisine from her family restaurant in the boroughs of New York.\nManagement\nTeam\nCory\nExecutive Chef\nTaylor\nGeneral Manager and Beverage Director\nRahim\nManager\nNaja\nManager\nSuzanne\nChef and Owner\nOpening Hours\nBrunch\nSaturday & Sunday 11:30AM – 3PM\nLunch\nWednesday-Sunday 11:30AM – 3PM\nHappy Hour\nTuesday 4PM – 6PM\nWednesday-Sunday 3PM – 6PM\nDinner\nTuesday-Thursday 4PM-10PM\nFriday-Saturday 4PM-11PM\nSunday 4PM-9PM\nFinish Content\nFinish Middle\nFinish Main\nStart Footer\nBrunch\nLunch\nDinner\nDessert\nContact\nGift Cards\ninfo@brulebistro.com\n561-274-2046\n200 NE 2nd Ave, Delray Beach, FL 33444\nSite Designed by Luca Web Concepts\n© 2021 Brule Bistro\nFinish Footer\nFinish Page\nInstagram Feed JS",
