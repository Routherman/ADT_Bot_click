It has been Larry’s dream to own his own lounge, a welcome addition to the wonderful place we have called home for 10 years in The Villages, Florida. We have seen God’s hands-on display throughout this process in each person, vendor, or offer of help; we call these “Christinstances.” Larry has always felt owning his own business was cut short due to his liver transplant almost 13 years ago when he had to step away. When he brought this up to Natalie, it was quite a challenge for her to walk through her fears of starting a business, but they are doing it!\nBuilding business relationships right after God is Larry’s first love. We have so much more to share about this journey. We’ve put our visions to reality! We are thrilled to welcome ALL, near and far! Holy Sh’mokes is centered around God, faith, fellowship, friendship, and much more.\nAbout Us\nWho we are…\nWe are excited to introduce Holy Sh’mokes of The Villages, Florida, a premium cigar, wine, beer, and coffee lovers heaven.
