Think you’re ready for the challenge?\nWhat They Say\nWow! Just Wow! This place has it all figured out. The portions are enormous and it’s all tastes amazing! It’s a good thing for my belly that I love way up in New Jersey or I would be in there all the time! The prices are very fair and the service was good. There is a parking lot so parking is not an issue. It’s a decent sized place but it gets packed up. What a way to start your day! Cant wait to go back next time I’m down in Florida. Maybe next time I will try the Fat Boy Breakfast Challenge!\nRT\nEvery visit is 5 star. I was hungry and ordered 3 pancakes. The server brought me a box with the food.

Weekend mornings are usually crowded with a wait, so get there early.\nMP\nA must stop when in the Punta Gorda area. You know a place is good when you stop for breakfast at 1040 on a weekday morning and the place is packed. I was the first to sit down in my party of 3 and no sooner did I sit, was offered a cup of coffee. This always makes for a 5 star ranking when accompanied by good food. Our server was very pleasant and did a great job. The menu was vast and I went with the meat lovers omlette (comination of ham, bacon, sauasage, cheese, topped with country gravy and some kielbasa) with potatoes and whole weat toast. Food came out hot and fresh and was tasty. Would definatly check this place. Never stopped for lunch, but pretty sure it would be just as good.\nAS\nRead More\nQuick Links\nHome\nAbout Us\nMenu\nGallery\nLocation\nHours\nOPEN EVERYDAY\n6:00 AM - 3:00 PM\nAddress\n502 King St. Suite A\nPunta Gorda, FL 33950\nPhone\n(941) 347-7645\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow",
