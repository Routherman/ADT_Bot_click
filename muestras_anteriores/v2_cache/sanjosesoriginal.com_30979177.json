To not just open a restaurant serving delicious, made-from-scratch Mexican dishes at everyday prices, but a place where guests of all ages could gather together to experience the unique flavors, along with the art and culture of Mexico – all in a comfortable, casual setting.\nFor the brothers, cooking had been a passion for many years prior to the opening of San Jose’s. They each have fond memories of following their grandmother around the kitchen helping her from the time they were very young. It was those precious moments, learning to cook, and finding joy in sharing their favorite dishes with others, that laid the foundation for San Jose’s years later.\nNow, nearly two decades later, with 4 locations across Central Florida, the success of San Jose’s has surpassed the founders’ original dreams.\nEach San Jose’s location is committed to using only the freshest, finest ingredients. All dishes are made from the heart and prepared with love as the recipes have been passed down from generations of the brother’s family.\nAt San Jose’s, team members have a great sense of pride in everything they do. From the food that is served, to the gracious hospitality that is provided. On each visit, their happy to welcome you into their “home.” Their passion ensures that you and your family will have a great experience each and every time.\nThe San Jose’s story is simple. Extraordinary flavor, impeccable service, and memorable experiences.\nProud Member of\n.container\n.site-content\nid wrapper closed\n©2024 San Jose’s Original Mexican Restaurant\nSite global modals",
