Whether you’re joining us for a drink with friends, to watch the big game or throw axes we strive to provide guests with unique and immersive social experiences.\nWhile many may not be familiar with axe throwing YET, it is a centuries old activity that we have modernized to make it fun for couples, friends, colleagues, parties, corporate events and everything in between. We do this by providing instruction, games, a world-class bar program, and a lodge style setting to help you channel your inner lumberjack.\nOur Axperts (yes, you should be prepared for lots of axe puns) will start your throwing session by teaching you the basics and working with you to refine your form (10-15 minutes). Once you’re throwing like real deal lumberjacks, they’ll officiate round robin or team style tournaments to get the competitive juices flowing amongst those in your throwing bay. Since axe throwing is all about form over power, we are confident that just about everyone will be throwing axes like a seasoned pro by the end of your throwing session.\nHave more questions?
