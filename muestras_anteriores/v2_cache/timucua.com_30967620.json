This event is dedicated to empowering artists of all backgrounds and experience levels to showcase their work in a welcoming, relaxed, and fun environment. The goals of this event are to support artists in overcoming imposter syndrome, foster meaningful connections, and provide a safe space where individuals can freely share and celebrate their unique artistic expressions.\nWe will begin with a short welcoming circle to introduce ourselves to one another and to establish a community within our space. Then, each participant will have 5 minutes to present their work, share their creative process, and discuss their inspirations behind their creations. Audience members are encouraged to engage with the artwork.\nIf you’re interested in showcasing your art, sign up\nhere\n***\nNOTE* PLEASE FILL OUT THE FORM 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE EVENT. Artwork will be showcased on a first-come, first-served basis. Early registration increases your chances of securing a spot to present.\nTickets are available on a pay what you like basis.\nPlease bring a bottle of wine or non alcoholic beverage to share.\nFree parking available on Summerlin and at Wadeview Park.\nPay What You Like\n.tribe-events-single-event-description\nAdd to calendar\nGoogle Calendar\niCalendar\nOutlook 365\nOutlook Live\nEvent meta\nDetails\nDate:\nOctober 15\nTime:\n7:30 pm - 9:00 pm\nEDT\nSeries:\nArtists’ Circle\nEvent Category:\nArt & Wellness\nVenue\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘦\n2000 S Summerlin Ave\nOrlando\n,\nFL\n32806\nUnited States\n+ Google Map\nPhone\n407-279-0902\nView Venue Website\n#post-x\nEvent footer\nNavigation\n«\nTimucua Jazz Jam\nAuthentic Selves Poetry Open Mic\n»\n#tribe-events-footer\n#tribe-events-content\nThis calendar is powered by The Events Calendar.\nhttp://evnt.is/18wn",
