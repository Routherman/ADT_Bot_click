Since so much of the action takes place on the trolleys, your experience would be a little bit like watching your neighbor's television through the living room window. Also, following the trolleys can cause traffic and safety issues as our actors sometimes have to go into the street. If you have a larger group with a private bus, we are happy to arrange a guide and a place in the schedule for your group. We strongly recommend boarding our custom-designed trolleys for the full experience.\nIs there food at Pensacola Winterfest?\nYes!
