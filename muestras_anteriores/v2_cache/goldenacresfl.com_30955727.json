You are part of a co-operative, with each owner having their own equal share of the park. The purchase price includes the share ($23,800) plus the cost of the coach. A Monthly Maintenance FEE of $210 covers other costs and amenities.\nThe park is well maintained, with each coach adhering to our high standards of proper maintenance and upkeep. Rules and Regulations and a Prospectus offer guidelines for residents. We are managed by a property management company, Progressive Management, Inc. Our property manager works closely with our elected Board of Directors who in turn work diligently with residents to discourage violations and encourage a well managed , efficiently run, communal living environment in Pinellas County Florida.\nA haven for snowbirds and locals alike, it's like old home week in the winter when Canadians, New Yorkers, New Englanders, and other cold weather folks flock to reunite with their winter friends in a sunny and warm, social environment. Shops, restaurants, banks, and medical facilities are all within walking distance.\nFacilities include an outdoor heated pool, recently renovated clubhouse with wireless, shuffleboard courts, wood-hobby shop, billiard room, and laundry facilities. An active, 55 plus, no-pet community offers a full range of recreational activities. Exercise classes, potluck dinners, cookouts, outings, golf courses nearby, and a full calendar of events are planned by the Recreation Committee. Sign ups\nare in the clubhouse. Available for residents are clubs, a golf league, shuffleboard league,cards, and more. Monthly calendars are in our printed distributed newsletters or the clubhouse.
