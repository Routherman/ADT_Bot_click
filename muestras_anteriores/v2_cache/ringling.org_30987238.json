Its History begins nearly a century ago.\nView the Timeline\nEND  hero-section\nA Tale of Art and Society\nThe Ringling is one of the preeminent arts institutions in the United States. Its unusually varied collections—art, circus, history, architecture, performance, gardens—reflect its unique origin story. At the heart of that story is circus impresario John Ringling and his wife Mable, and their shared desire to make Sarasota a world-class destination.\nRead Less\nA Unique Origin Story\nJohn Ringling was one of the five Ringling brothers who took their first circus show on the road in 1884. Although they started small, the brothers’ operation quickly grew in size and success as each took on a distinct management role.\nBy 1907, they were able to purchase the Barnum & Bailey show—another testament to their business acumen. John became the most financially successful of the brothers, diversifying his investments in ventures such as railroads, ranching, and real estate.\nJohn and Mable married in 1905. Like John, Mable came from humble Midwest origins. The couple never had children; instead, they filled their home with social engagements, visits from family and friends, many pets, and a growing collection of fine furniture and artwork.\nIn 1911, John and Mable purchased a winter home on 20 acres of waterfront property in Sarasota. At the time, Sarasota was a small fishing village, but the Ringlings saw the potential to develop it into something more. By the 1920s, John had grown even wealthier, and the couple decided to build a new home on their property befitting of their status.\nRead Less\nInvesting in Sarasota\nJohn and Mable hired New York architect Dwight James Baum to design the mansion that became known as Ca’ d’Zan (“House of John” in the Venetian dialect). Baum created a masterpiece of the Mediterranean Revival style, incorporating glazed terracotta, colored marble, and stained glass into the house, which blended Italian Renaissance and Venetian Gothic elements with an array of eclectic European designs. At 36,000 square feet and 56 rooms, the house was meant to impress! It was completed in 1926 after only two years of construction.\nDuring the period of construction on their new mansion, John and Mable made two other significant decisions that forever changed the Sarasota landscape:\n• They decided to build an art museum that they would leave to the people of Florida as their legacy. John began collecting art in earnest. In less than six years, he added more than 400 paintings of major and minor artists, bringing his collection to over 600 works.\n• In 1927, John moved the winter quarters of the circus from Bridgeport, Connecticut to Sarasota. All winter, visitors could pay a small admission fee and visit the circus lot, watching acts rehearse in preparation for the upcoming season. This made an indelible mark on the city’s identity, not only as a circus town, but also as a national tourist destination.\nRead Less\nTransitions\n1929 was a difficult year. Mable passed away at the age of 54, having only spent three winter seasons at Ca’ d’Zan, and the stock market crash caused significant financial difficulties for John. Nonetheless, The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art opened to the public in 1930, making the couple’s planned legacy a reality at last. Five years later, upon his own death in 1936, John bequeathed the museum and the rest of his estate to the people of Florida.\nHurt by the Depression and unsuccessful business endeavors, John had fallen into debt. Legal wrangling and eager creditors delayed the settling of his estate until 1946. During this decade, the Museum of Art was only occasionally opened and was not properly maintained. Ca’ d’Zan remained closed to the public.\nWhen the state prevailed and took control in 1946, the estate required significant care—including weatherproofing, mechanical upgrades, and maintenance of Mable’s gardens. Some private donors came forward to help keep the museum open, while a dedicated but severely underfunded staff struggled to fulfill the museum’s potential. Gradually, under the guidance of The Ringling’s first director, A. Everett “Chick” Austin, Jr., the museum regained its momentum.\nIn 1948, Austin established the first museum in America dedicated to the circus, filled with artifacts, photographs, costumes, and props largely acquired from the local circus performers who had made Sarasota their home. The dedication to the preservation of circus history has since become a foundation of The Ringling’s mission.\nAustin also believed in the importance of the performing arts, establishing The Ringling’s commitment to live performance. In 1952, the Historic Asolo Theater, originally built in 1798 in Asolo, Italy, was reassembled in Sarasota, providing a dedicated venue at The Ringling for the performing arts. The U-shaped theater, with three tiers of boxes adorned by decorative panels, is used for plays, concerts, operas, lectures, films and other cultural programming.\nRead Less\nNew Beginnings and Significant Growth\nIn 2000, after years of negotiation, the state transferred governance of the museum to Florida State University (FSU). During this time, with new sources of funding and new leadership, The Ringling experienced an extraordinary rebirth. Ca’ d’Zan underwent a $15 million restoration. The Historic Asolo Theater was restored and moved inside the new John M. McKay Visitors Pavilion—one many new buildings added during this era.\nIn January 2006, the Tibbals Learning Center became the newest addition to the Circus Museum and immediately began wowing visitors with its centerpiece 3,800-square-foot\nHoward Bros. Circus Model\n, a 42,000-piece historically accurate model circus. In 2012, interactive galleries were added to the Tibbals Learning Center, activating the circus arts and allowing visitors to try walking the wire, squeezing into a clown car, or balancing on the back of a horse. The Tibbals Learning Center also contains The Ringling Archives, which house one of the country’s most important collections of rare handbills and art prints, circus papers, business records, heralds and photos.\nOther additions to the estate have continued to make The Ringling a space for everyone, no matter their age or interests. The state-of-the-art Johnson-Blalock Education Center, complete with storage facilities, offices and an art library, has become an essential resource for scholars, educators and students. In 2013, the David F. Bolger Playspace opened to encourage families and school groups to engage in spontaneous play during their visits. The Ulla R. and Arthur F. Searing Wing, added to the north wing of the museum in 2007, provided more than 20,000 square feet of exhibition space. In 2011,\nJoseph’s Coat\n: A Skyspace by James Turrell was added to the Searing Wing, marking a significant addition to The Ringling’s modern and contemporary art program.\nIn 2016, the Ting Tsung and Wei Fong Chao Center for Asian Art opened to promote the appreciation of Asian history and society through exhibitions, programs, and publications. That same year, the 2,400-square-foot Keith D. Monda Gallery for Contemporary Art was created, marking the first time a gallery space at the museum was permanently devoted to modern and contemporary art.\nThe Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion, built in 2018, showcases The Ringling’s growing collection of vibrant studio glass. Free and open to the public, this 5,500-square-foot space also serves as an entry point for visitors to the Historic Asolo Theatre. The Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion’s sculptural glass façade and innovative design became the most recent landmark work of architecture on The Ringling campus.\nBEGIN  hero-section\n2023-24 Annual Review\nWe experienced record-breaking numbers in admissions and earned income.

Its History begins nearly a century ago.\nView the Timeline\nA Tale of Art and Society\nThe Ringling is one of the preeminent arts institutions in the United States. Its unusually varied collections—art, circus, history, architecture, performance, gardens—reflect its unique origin story. At the heart of that story is circus impresario John Ringling and his wife Mable, and their shared desire to make Sarasota a world-class destination.\nRead Less\nA Unique Origin Story\nJohn Ringling was one of the five Ringling brothers who took their first circus show on the road in 1884. Although they started small, the brothers’ operation quickly grew in size and success as each took on a distinct management role.\nBy 1907, they were able to purchase the Barnum & Bailey show—another testament to their business acumen. John became the most financially successful of the brothers, diversifying his investments in ventures such as railroads, ranching, and real estate.\nJohn and Mable married in 1905. Like John, Mable came from humble Midwest origins. The couple never had children; instead, they filled their home with social engagements, visits from family and friends, many pets, and a growing collection of fine furniture and artwork.\nIn 1911, John and Mable purchased a winter home on 20 acres of waterfront property in Sarasota. At the time, Sarasota was a small fishing village, but the Ringlings saw the potential to develop it into something more. By the 1920s, John had grown even wealthier, and the couple decided to build a new home on their property befitting of their status.\nRead Less\nInvesting in Sarasota\nJohn and Mable hired New York architect Dwight James Baum to design the mansion that became known as Ca’ d’Zan (“House of John” in the Venetian dialect). Baum created a masterpiece of the Mediterranean Revival style, incorporating glazed terracotta, colored marble, and stained glass into the house, which blended Italian Renaissance and Venetian Gothic elements with an array of eclectic European designs. At 36,000 square feet and 56 rooms, the house was meant to impress! It was completed in 1926 after only two years of construction.\nDuring the period of construction on their new mansion, John and Mable made two other significant decisions that forever changed the Sarasota landscape:\n• They decided to build an art museum that they would leave to the people of Florida as their legacy. John began collecting art in earnest. In less than six years, he added more than 400 paintings of major and minor artists, bringing his collection to over 600 works.\n• In 1927, John moved the winter quarters of the circus from Bridgeport, Connecticut to Sarasota. All winter, visitors could pay a small admission fee and visit the circus lot, watching acts rehearse in preparation for the upcoming season. This made an indelible mark on the city’s identity, not only as a circus town, but also as a national tourist destination.\nRead Less\nTransitions\n1929 was a difficult year. Mable passed away at the age of 54, having only spent three winter seasons at Ca’ d’Zan, and the stock market crash caused significant financial difficulties for John. Nonetheless, The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art opened to the public in 1930, making the couple’s planned legacy a reality at last. Five years later, upon his own death in 1936, John bequeathed the museum and the rest of his estate to the people of Florida.\nHurt by the Depression and unsuccessful business endeavors, John had fallen into debt. Legal wrangling and eager creditors delayed the settling of his estate until 1946. During this decade, the Museum of Art was only occasionally opened and was not properly maintained. Ca’ d’Zan remained closed to the public.\nWhen the state prevailed and took control in 1946, the estate required significant care—including weatherproofing, mechanical upgrades, and maintenance of Mable’s gardens. Some private donors came forward to help keep the museum open, while a dedicated but severely underfunded staff struggled to fulfill the museum’s potential. Gradually, under the guidance of The Ringling’s first director, A. Everett “Chick” Austin, Jr., the museum regained its momentum.\nIn 1948, Austin established the first museum in America dedicated to the circus, filled with artifacts, photographs, costumes, and props largely acquired from the local circus performers who had made Sarasota their home. The dedication to the preservation of circus history has since become a foundation of The Ringling’s mission.\nAustin also believed in the importance of the performing arts, establishing The Ringling’s commitment to live performance. In 1952, the Historic Asolo Theater, originally built in 1798 in Asolo, Italy, was reassembled in Sarasota, providing a dedicated venue at The Ringling for the performing arts. The U-shaped theater, with three tiers of boxes adorned by decorative panels, is used for plays, concerts, operas, lectures, films and other cultural programming.\nRead Less\nNew Beginnings and Significant Growth\nIn 2000, after years of negotiation, the state transferred governance of the museum to Florida State University (FSU). During this time, with new sources of funding and new leadership, The Ringling experienced an extraordinary rebirth. Ca’ d’Zan underwent a $15 million restoration. The Historic Asolo Theater was restored and moved inside the new John M. McKay Visitors Pavilion—one many new buildings added during this era.\nIn January 2006, the Tibbals Learning Center became the newest addition to the Circus Museum and immediately began wowing visitors with its centerpiece 3,800-square-foot\nHoward Bros. Circus Model\n, a 42,000-piece historically accurate model circus. In 2012, interactive galleries were added to the Tibbals Learning Center, activating the circus arts and allowing visitors to try walking the wire, squeezing into a clown car, or balancing on the back of a horse. The Tibbals Learning Center also contains The Ringling Archives, which house one of the country’s most important collections of rare handbills and art prints, circus papers, business records, heralds and photos.\nOther additions to the estate have continued to make The Ringling a space for everyone, no matter their age or interests. The state-of-the-art Johnson-Blalock Education Center, complete with storage facilities, offices and an art library, has become an essential resource for scholars, educators and students. In 2013, the David F. Bolger Playspace opened to encourage families and school groups to engage in spontaneous play during their visits. The Ulla R. and Arthur F. Searing Wing, added to the north wing of the museum in 2007, provided more than 20,000 square feet of exhibition space. In 2011,\nJoseph’s Coat\n: A Skyspace by James Turrell was added to the Searing Wing, marking a significant addition to The Ringling’s modern and contemporary art program.\nIn 2016, the Ting Tsung and Wei Fong Chao Center for Asian Art opened to promote the appreciation of Asian history and society through exhibitions, programs, and publications. That same year, the 2,400-square-foot Keith D. Monda Gallery for Contemporary Art was created, marking the first time a gallery space at the museum was permanently devoted to modern and contemporary art.\nThe Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion, built in 2018, showcases The Ringling’s growing collection of vibrant studio glass. Free and open to the public, this 5,500-square-foot space also serves as an entry point for visitors to the Historic Asolo Theatre. The Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion’s sculptural glass façade and innovative design became the most recent landmark work of architecture on The Ringling campus.\n2023-24 Annual Review\nWe experienced record-breaking numbers in admissions and earned income.

Its History begins nearly a century ago.\nView the Timeline\nEND  hero-section\nA Tale of Art and Society\nThe Ringling is one of the preeminent arts institutions in the United States. Its unusually varied collections—art, circus, history, architecture, performance, gardens—reflect its unique origin story. At the heart of that story is circus impresario John Ringling and his wife Mable, and their shared desire to make Sarasota a world-class destination.\nRead Less\nA Unique Origin Story\nJohn Ringling was one of the five Ringling brothers who took their first circus show on the road in 1884. Although they started small, the brothers’ operation quickly grew in size and success as each took on a distinct management role.\nBy 1907, they were able to purchase the Barnum & Bailey show—another testament to their business acumen. John became the most financially successful of the brothers, diversifying his investments in ventures such as railroads, ranching, and real estate.\nJohn and Mable married in 1905. Like John, Mable came from humble Midwest origins. The couple never had children; instead, they filled their home with social engagements, visits from family and friends, many pets, and a growing collection of fine furniture and artwork.\nIn 1911, John and Mable purchased a winter home on 20 acres of waterfront property in Sarasota. At the time, Sarasota was a small fishing village, but the Ringlings saw the potential to develop it into something more. By the 1920s, John had grown even wealthier, and the couple decided to build a new home on their property befitting of their status.\nRead Less\nInvesting in Sarasota\nJohn and Mable hired New York architect Dwight James Baum to design the mansion that became known as Ca’ d’Zan (“House of John” in the Venetian dialect). Baum created a masterpiece of the Mediterranean Revival style, incorporating glazed terracotta, colored marble, and stained glass into the house, which blended Italian Renaissance and Venetian Gothic elements with an array of eclectic European designs. At 36,000 square feet and 56 rooms, the house was meant to impress! It was completed in 1926 after only two years of construction.\nDuring the period of construction on their new mansion, John and Mable made two other significant decisions that forever changed the Sarasota landscape:\n• They decided to build an art museum that they would leave to the people of Florida as their legacy. John began collecting art in earnest. In less than six years, he added more than 400 paintings of major and minor artists, bringing his collection to over 600 works.\n• In 1927, John moved the winter quarters of the circus from Bridgeport, Connecticut to Sarasota. All winter, visitors could pay a small admission fee and visit the circus lot, watching acts rehearse in preparation for the upcoming season. This made an indelible mark on the city’s identity, not only as a circus town, but also as a national tourist destination.\nRead Less\nTransitions\n1929 was a difficult year. Mable passed away at the age of 54, having only spent three winter seasons at Ca’ d’Zan, and the stock market crash caused significant financial difficulties for John. Nonetheless, The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art opened to the public in 1930, making the couple’s planned legacy a reality at last. Five years later, upon his own death in 1936, John bequeathed the museum and the rest of his estate to the people of Florida.\nHurt by the Depression and unsuccessful business endeavors, John had fallen into debt. Legal wrangling and eager creditors delayed the settling of his estate until 1946. During this decade, the Museum of Art was only occasionally opened and was not properly maintained. Ca’ d’Zan remained closed to the public.\nWhen the state prevailed and took control in 1946, the estate required significant care—including weatherproofing, mechanical upgrades, and maintenance of Mable’s gardens. Some private donors came forward to help keep the museum open, while a dedicated but severely underfunded staff struggled to fulfill the museum’s potential. Gradually, under the guidance of The Ringling’s first director, A. Everett “Chick” Austin, Jr., the museum regained its momentum.\nIn 1948, Austin established the first museum in America dedicated to the circus, filled with artifacts, photographs, costumes, and props largely acquired from the local circus performers who had made Sarasota their home. The dedication to the preservation of circus history has since become a foundation of The Ringling’s mission.\nAustin also believed in the importance of the performing arts, establishing The Ringling’s commitment to live performance. In 1952, the Historic Asolo Theater, originally built in 1798 in Asolo, Italy, was reassembled in Sarasota, providing a dedicated venue at The Ringling for the performing arts. The U-shaped theater, with three tiers of boxes adorned by decorative panels, is used for plays, concerts, operas, lectures, films and other cultural programming.\nRead Less\nNew Beginnings and Significant Growth\nIn 2000, after years of negotiation, the state transferred governance of the museum to Florida State University (FSU). During this time, with new sources of funding and new leadership, The Ringling experienced an extraordinary rebirth. Ca’ d’Zan underwent a $15 million restoration. The Historic Asolo Theater was restored and moved inside the new John M. McKay Visitors Pavilion—one many new buildings added during this era.\nIn January 2006, the Tibbals Learning Center became the newest addition to the Circus Museum and immediately began wowing visitors with its centerpiece 3,800-square-foot\nHoward Bros. Circus Model\n, a 42,000-piece historically accurate model circus. In 2012, interactive galleries were added to the Tibbals Learning Center, activating the circus arts and allowing visitors to try walking the wire, squeezing into a clown car, or balancing on the back of a horse. The Tibbals Learning Center also contains The Ringling Archives, which house one of the country’s most important collections of rare handbills and art prints, circus papers, business records, heralds and photos.\nOther additions to the estate have continued to make The Ringling a space for everyone, no matter their age or interests. The state-of-the-art Johnson-Blalock Education Center, complete with storage facilities, offices and an art library, has become an essential resource for scholars, educators and students. In 2013, the David F. Bolger Playspace opened to encourage families and school groups to engage in spontaneous play during their visits. The Ulla R. and Arthur F. Searing Wing, added to the north wing of the museum in 2007, provided more than 20,000 square feet of exhibition space. In 2011,\nJoseph’s Coat\n: A Skyspace by James Turrell was added to the Searing Wing, marking a significant addition to The Ringling’s modern and contemporary art program.\nIn 2016, the Ting Tsung and Wei Fong Chao Center for Asian Art opened to promote the appreciation of Asian history and society through exhibitions, programs, and publications. That same year, the 2,400-square-foot Keith D. Monda Gallery for Contemporary Art was created, marking the first time a gallery space at the museum was permanently devoted to modern and contemporary art.\nThe Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion, built in 2018, showcases The Ringling’s growing collection of vibrant studio glass. Free and open to the public, this 5,500-square-foot space also serves as an entry point for visitors to the Historic Asolo Theatre. The Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion’s sculptural glass façade and innovative design became the most recent landmark work of architecture on The Ringling campus.\nBEGIN  hero-section\n2023-24 Annual Review\nWe experienced record-breaking numbers in admissions and earned income.

Its History begins nearly a century ago.\nView the Timeline\nA Tale of Art and Society\nThe Ringling is one of the preeminent arts institutions in the United States. Its unusually varied collections—art, circus, history, architecture, performance, gardens—reflect its unique origin story. At the heart of that story is circus impresario John Ringling and his wife Mable, and their shared desire to make Sarasota a world-class destination.\nRead Less\nA Unique Origin Story\nJohn Ringling was one of the five Ringling brothers who took their first circus show on the road in 1884. Although they started small, the brothers’ operation quickly grew in size and success as each took on a distinct management role.\nBy 1907, they were able to purchase the Barnum & Bailey show—another testament to their business acumen. John became the most financially successful of the brothers, diversifying his investments in ventures such as railroads, ranching, and real estate.\nJohn and Mable married in 1905. Like John, Mable came from humble Midwest origins. The couple never had children; instead, they filled their home with social engagements, visits from family and friends, many pets, and a growing collection of fine furniture and artwork.\nIn 1911, John and Mable purchased a winter home on 20 acres of waterfront property in Sarasota. At the time, Sarasota was a small fishing village, but the Ringlings saw the potential to develop it into something more. By the 1920s, John had grown even wealthier, and the couple decided to build a new home on their property befitting of their status.\nRead Less\nInvesting in Sarasota\nJohn and Mable hired New York architect Dwight James Baum to design the mansion that became known as Ca’ d’Zan (“House of John” in the Venetian dialect). Baum created a masterpiece of the Mediterranean Revival style, incorporating glazed terracotta, colored marble, and stained glass into the house, which blended Italian Renaissance and Venetian Gothic elements with an array of eclectic European designs. At 36,000 square feet and 56 rooms, the house was meant to impress! It was completed in 1926 after only two years of construction.\nDuring the period of construction on their new mansion, John and Mable made two other significant decisions that forever changed the Sarasota landscape:\n• They decided to build an art museum that they would leave to the people of Florida as their legacy. John began collecting art in earnest. In less than six years, he added more than 400 paintings of major and minor artists, bringing his collection to over 600 works.\n• In 1927, John moved the winter quarters of the circus from Bridgeport, Connecticut to Sarasota. All winter, visitors could pay a small admission fee and visit the circus lot, watching acts rehearse in preparation for the upcoming season. This made an indelible mark on the city’s identity, not only as a circus town, but also as a national tourist destination.\nRead Less\nTransitions\n1929 was a difficult year. Mable passed away at the age of 54, having only spent three winter seasons at Ca’ d’Zan, and the stock market crash caused significant financial difficulties for John. Nonetheless, The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art opened to the public in 1930, making the couple’s planned legacy a reality at last. Five years later, upon his own death in 1936, John bequeathed the museum and the rest of his estate to the people of Florida.\nHurt by the Depression and unsuccessful business endeavors, John had fallen into debt. Legal wrangling and eager creditors delayed the settling of his estate until 1946. During this decade, the Museum of Art was only occasionally opened and was not properly maintained. Ca’ d’Zan remained closed to the public.\nWhen the state prevailed and took control in 1946, the estate required significant care—including weatherproofing, mechanical upgrades, and maintenance of Mable’s gardens. Some private donors came forward to help keep the museum open, while a dedicated but severely underfunded staff struggled to fulfill the museum’s potential. Gradually, under the guidance of The Ringling’s first director, A. Everett “Chick” Austin, Jr., the museum regained its momentum.\nIn 1948, Austin established the first museum in America dedicated to the circus, filled with artifacts, photographs, costumes, and props largely acquired from the local circus performers who had made Sarasota their home. The dedication to the preservation of circus history has since become a foundation of The Ringling’s mission.\nAustin also believed in the importance of the performing arts, establishing The Ringling’s commitment to live performance. In 1952, the Historic Asolo Theater, originally built in 1798 in Asolo, Italy, was reassembled in Sarasota, providing a dedicated venue at The Ringling for the performing arts. The U-shaped theater, with three tiers of boxes adorned by decorative panels, is used for plays, concerts, operas, lectures, films and other cultural programming.\nRead Less\nNew Beginnings and Significant Growth\nIn 2000, after years of negotiation, the state transferred governance of the museum to Florida State University (FSU). During this time, with new sources of funding and new leadership, The Ringling experienced an extraordinary rebirth. Ca’ d’Zan underwent a $15 million restoration. The Historic Asolo Theater was restored and moved inside the new John M. McKay Visitors Pavilion—one many new buildings added during this era.\nIn January 2006, the Tibbals Learning Center became the newest addition to the Circus Museum and immediately began wowing visitors with its centerpiece 3,800-square-foot\nHoward Bros. Circus Model\n, a 42,000-piece historically accurate model circus. In 2012, interactive galleries were added to the Tibbals Learning Center, activating the circus arts and allowing visitors to try walking the wire, squeezing into a clown car, or balancing on the back of a horse. The Tibbals Learning Center also contains The Ringling Archives, which house one of the country’s most important collections of rare handbills and art prints, circus papers, business records, heralds and photos.\nOther additions to the estate have continued to make The Ringling a space for everyone, no matter their age or interests. The state-of-the-art Johnson-Blalock Education Center, complete with storage facilities, offices and an art library, has become an essential resource for scholars, educators and students. In 2013, the David F. Bolger Playspace opened to encourage families and school groups to engage in spontaneous play during their visits. The Ulla R. and Arthur F. Searing Wing, added to the north wing of the museum in 2007, provided more than 20,000 square feet of exhibition space. In 2011,\nJoseph’s Coat\n: A Skyspace by James Turrell was added to the Searing Wing, marking a significant addition to The Ringling’s modern and contemporary art program.\nIn 2016, the Ting Tsung and Wei Fong Chao Center for Asian Art opened to promote the appreciation of Asian history and society through exhibitions, programs, and publications. That same year, the 2,400-square-foot Keith D. Monda Gallery for Contemporary Art was created, marking the first time a gallery space at the museum was permanently devoted to modern and contemporary art.\nThe Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion, built in 2018, showcases The Ringling’s growing collection of vibrant studio glass. Free and open to the public, this 5,500-square-foot space also serves as an entry point for visitors to the Historic Asolo Theatre. The Kotler-Coville Glass Pavilion’s sculptural glass façade and innovative design became the most recent landmark work of architecture on The Ringling campus.\n2023-24 Annual Review\nWe experienced record-breaking numbers in admissions and earned income. We are looking forward to sustained growth for the future.\nLearn more\nAnnual Review Archive",
