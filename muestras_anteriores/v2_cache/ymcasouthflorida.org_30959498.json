As a leading nonprofit, the Y is committed to strengthening community through more than 200 programs serving everyone from six months old to 100 years young.\nOur Family Centers and programs are inclusive, vibrant hubs of community life, offering a diverse array of classes, cutting-edge fitness facilities, life-saving aquatics, exciting community events, unforgettable camps, supportive afterschool care, and holistic health and wellness programming.\nAt the Y, there’s something for everyone.\nFIND A YMCA\nOUR MISSION\nOur mission is to put Judeo-Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all.\nOUR\nCAUSE\nStrengthening communities is our cause.\nThat’s why, every day, we work side-by-side with our neighbors to make sure everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to learn, grow and thrive.\nOUR FOCUS\nAll of the Y’s programs and services support three areas of focus, indicating WHY we do what we do.\nYOUTH DEVELOPMENT\nNURTURING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY CHILD AND TEEN\nWe believe that all kids deserve the opportunity to discover who they are and what they can achieve. That’s why, through the Y, more youth today are cultivating the values, skills, and relationships that lead to positive behaviors, better health, and educational achievement.\nHEALTHY LIVING\nIMPROVING THE COMMUNITY’S HEALTH AND WELL-BEING\nIn our community, the Y is a leading voice on health and well-being. With a mission centered on balance, the Y brings families closer together, encourages good health and fosters connections through fitness, sports, fun and shared interests. As a result, more youth, adults, and families are receiving the support, guidance, and resources needed to achieve greater health and well-being for their spirit, mind, and body.\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nGIVING BACK AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO OUR NEIGHBORS\nOur Y has been listening and responding to our community’s most critical social needs for 100 years. Whether developing skills or emotional well-being through education and training, welcoming and connecting diverse demographic populations through community service, or preventing chronic disease and building healthier communities through collaborations with policymakers, the Y fosters the care and respect all people need and deserve.
