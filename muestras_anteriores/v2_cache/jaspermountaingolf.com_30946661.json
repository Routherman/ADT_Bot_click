This historic season marks the start of our Centennial celebrations, culminating in a milestone anniversary on July 17, 2025.\n​\n\nPhase 1: Pre-Season Restoration | January - June 2025\nIn preparation for reopening, the course will undergo significant restoration and recovery efforts. Pre-season work includes tree removal that will re-open historic sightlines, resurfacing select greens, and introducing temporary on-course food and beverage offerings to elevate the guest experience from the first day of play.\n\nPhase 2: Centennial Season | July - October 2025\nThe course reopens on July 1, 2025, ushering in 100 days of play for our 100th year, with a Centennial celebration throughout the season. During this once-in-a-century season, guests will enjoy panoramic mountain views and the rare opportunity to play the course as it was originally designed in 1925. Enhancements will continue throughout the season, including the phased installation of a state-of-the-art irrigation system and refined play features, with minimal disruption to\nguest play.\n\nPhase 3: Legacy Enhancements | October 2025-2027\nFollowing our 2025 season, long-term enhancements will continue to position Jasper Park Lodge Golf Course as one of Canada’s top-ranked courses. This phase includes bunker restorations, permanent infrastructure such as refined food and beverage  venues and architecturally integrated shelters, and ongoing tree-planting and landscaping to preserve the course’s alpine beauty for generations to come.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nIs this a good year to play Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge Golf Club?\n/$\n$\nYes! This is a once-in-a-century moment. As we honour a legacy nearly a hundred years in the making, 2025 will introduce memorable experiences, heritage storytelling, and the return of “The Den,” our long-lost 19th hole: a 471-yard Par 5 that hasn’t been played in over 60 years. Guests will have the rare opportunity to experience this unique layout during our anniversary season.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nWas the golf course affected by the 2024 wildfires?\n/$\n$\nYes. While our course was significantly impacted, thanks to the bravery of local First Responders, Parks Canada and strategic irrigation deployment, we were able to preserve its most essential features. We are proud to say that not only is the course fully playable this year, but our reopening is also a grand moment for the community of Jasper, signaling a new era of investment, environmental stewardship, and course excellence.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nWhat restoration work is being done?\n/$\n$\nWe are embarking on a three-phase journey to rehabilitate and elevate the course. For a detailed overview of the planned work, please click the link below.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nWill all 18 holes be open for play?\n/$\n$\nYes, all 18 holes, including the newly reintroduced 19th hole, will be open for play. Guests will enjoy both classic holes and revitalized features that blend seamlessly into the iconic Stanley Thompson layout.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nAre there any areas still under construction?\n/$\n$\nSome infrastructure improvements and landscaping work will continue throughout the season. These are thoughtfully managed to minimize disruption to your game and ensure the course’s beauty and integrity for future generations.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nHow can I be part of the Centennial celebration?\n/$\n$\nBy joining us this season, you are part of something historic. Keep an eye on our social media channels and clubhouse for special events, collector’s merchandise, and legacy storytelling celebrating 100 years of golf in Jasper National Park.\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nFairmont Jasper Park Lodge\n1 Old Lodge Road\nJasper, Alberta\nCanada, T0E 1E0\n1 780 852 6090\n​\njpl.golfreservations@fairmont.com\n/$\n$\nGET DIRECTIONS\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\nFAQ'S | CONTACT US\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nFAQ'S | CONTACT US\n/$\n/$\n$\nFAQs\nWhat to Expect During Our Centennial Year\n/$\n$\n$\nWhen does the golf course reopen?\n/$\n$\nWe are thrilled to reopen the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge Golf Club on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, just in time to begin celebrating 100 years of mountain golf in the Canadian Rockies.
