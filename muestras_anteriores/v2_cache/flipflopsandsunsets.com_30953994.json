Sound intriguing? St. Joseph Bay is filled with turtles, dolphin, fish, seahorses and more. With her soft, grass flats and clear shallow water, she is a kayaker’s and snorkeler’s dream. Even in the deeper water, the current is calm and perfect for paddleboarding or an eco tour. Have a few adventures you’d like to check off your list?
