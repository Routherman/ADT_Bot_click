When he comes to a pretty little village deep in the country and the people ask him what he is carrying…he will know that he’s found Fiddlers Green. The people give him a seat in the sun outside the Village Inn with a glass of grog that refills itself every time he drains the last drop and a pipe forever smoking with fragrant tobacco. From then onwards he has nothing to do but enjoy his glass and pipe and watch the maidens dancing to the music of a fiddle on Fiddlers Green.\nAugust Calendar Download\nDon't Miss\nTrivia\n$5 Martini Monday\nHappy Hour\nSunday Brunch Trivia\n12pm - 2pm\nWednesday Night Trivia\n7pm - 9pm\nHappy Hour\n$5 Martini Monday\nHappy Hour\nMonday through Friday\n4pm - 7pm\n$5 Martini Monday\n$5 Martini Monday\n$5 Martini Monday\nMondays\nAll day!\nLUNCH  |  BRUNCH  |  DINNER\nJoin us any day of the week for good Irish food!\nFOOD MENU\nBook your Event\nContact Us\nDrop us a line!\nName\nEmail*\nSend\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nBetter yet, see us in person!\nWe love our customers, so feel free to visit during normal business hours.\nFiddler’s Green Irish Pub & Eatery\n544 Fairbanks Avenue, Winter Park, Florida 32789, United States\n📞\n407.645.2050\n|  📧\nfiddspub@gmail.com\nHours of Operation\nOpen today\n11:30 am – 02:00 am\nSubscribe\nSign up to hear from us about specials, and events.\nEmail\nSign up\nPUB\nFOOD\nFIDD'S TOUR\nBOOK EVENT\n5K CHARITY RUN\nOPPORTUNITIES\nCONTACT US\nFiddler’s Green Irish Pub & Eatery\n📞\n407.645.2050\n|  📧\nfiddspub@gmail.com\n© 2025 Fiddler’s Green Irish Pub & Eatery - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by",
