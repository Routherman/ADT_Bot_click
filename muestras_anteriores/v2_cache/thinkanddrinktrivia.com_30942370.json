      "text": "A Humble Beginning, and ongoing Journey 🚀\nThink and Drink Trivia was born out of a simple love for engaging the mind and enjoying good company. In 2008, Steve Steckroth, a full-time special education art teacher, planted the seed that would grow into a trivia sensation. His vision: to create a trivia experience that was as enjoyable for the casual enthusiast as it was for the dedicated trivia buff.\nWhere It All Started 📍\nOur first trivia night took place 15 years ago at Two George’s Waterfront Grill in Boynton Beach. Back then, Steve donned the hat of the host, question writer, and event organizer… Little did he know, this was the start of something extraordinary.\n*not a tip bucket, it’s where players dropped their answer slips\nThe Growth Story 🌱\nAs word spread about the fun atmosphere of Think and Drink Trivia nights, demand grew. Our trivia nights became places where friends could gather, where laughs were shared, and where minds were challenged.\nFast forward to today, and Think and Drink Trivia has blossomed into an enterprise hosting more than 70 games a week with the dedicated efforts of over 50 trivia hosts.\nMore Than Just Trivia 🧡\nBut at its heart, Think and Drink Trivia is more than just questions and answers. It’s a community, it’s a night to look forward to, and it’s an experience that brings people together. Our questions range from history to pop culture, ensuring that everyone has a moment to shine.\nGiving Back With Pride ❤️\nWe firmly believe in sharing our success with the community. We are proud to support Els for Autism, specifically The Learning Academy. Being associated with such incredible individuals has enriched our journey. They are doing remarkable things every single day, and we're honored to stand with them. If you're looking for a worthy cause, we wholeheartedly recommend considering them.\nCheck them out here!\nOur Commitment to Quality 📝\nWe understand that trivia is a learning experience, and we take our questions very seriously. Our aim is to avoid overly-broad or inaccurate questions. Meticulous sourcing and referencing of all questions is part of our process. If you ever come across a question that doesn’t seem right, we want to hear from you! And if you’ve got a great trivia question in mind, we’d love for you to share it with us.\nSubmit your questions here!\nYOU(!) are Invited! 🎉\nWhether you’re a trivia whiz or just looking for a night of fun, Think and Drink Trivia welcomes you.
