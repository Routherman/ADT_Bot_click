This is the community we chose to raise our family, and we could not be happier that this is the community in which our children are choosing to raise their families.\nWhen we were presented with the vision for Bonnet Springs Park, we recognized the opportunity to create a place that will be truly transformational not just for our Lakeland community, but for our entire region. More than a beautification project, Bonnet Springs Park will tie together facets that will make our city even more vibrant than it is today. It will offer opportunities for children and adults to engage with our city's history, which is rooted in the land on which the park is being built. It will provide an environment in which you can explore nature in a serene and sculptured setting, a setting which will be unlike any other park in our state. And it will create a place to which children, families, students, and visitors can escape the ordinary and experience the extraordinary.\nDavid Bunch and Bill Tinsley envisioned this park, working tirelessly to gather our support and the support of countless members throughout the community. We are excited and honored to work alongside a talented team of volunteers to help lead this project from vision into reality. Together, we will create a place for our community to escape, engage, and explore in Central Florida. There is much work to be done, with more to come, and we hope you will follow along on this journey to create Bonnet Springs Park….a legacy for generations to come.\nBarney Barnett\nFounding Chairman, Board of Directors\nBoard Members\nBarney\nBarnett,\nChairman & Vice Chairman\nJean\nBunch,\nSecretary\nBill\nVass,\nTreasurer\nJohn\nAttaway,\nBoard Chair\nNick\nBarnett\nWesley\nBarnett\nMarcy\nBenton\nDavid\nBunch\nJeffrey\nCox, Sr.\nKimberly\nElmhorst\nDonna\nHenricks\nJustin\nHollis\nSara\nRoberts McCarley\nKathleen\nMunson\nTim\nRice\nMartha\nSantiago\nBill\nTinsley\nMartha\nTinsley\nStaff\nJosh\nHenderson\nCEO\nKirsten\nHein\nVice President of Engagement\nJennifer\nRoyal\nVice President of Finance\nWendy\nStephens\nSenior Director of Human Resources\nKellie\nPhillips\nDirector of Development\nStephanie\nBernal\nDirector of Events\nLeadership\nAbout The Park\nLeadership\nMessage from the\nChairman of the Board\nCarol and I have been fortunate to spend most of our lives living in Central Florida, giving us the opportunity to see our community's growth firsthand.

It will offer opportunities for children and adults to engage with our city's history, which is rooted in the land on which the park is being built. It will provide an environment in which you can explore nature in a serene and sculptured setting, a setting which will be unlike any other park in our state. And it will create a place to which children, families, students, and visitors can escape the ordinary and experience the extraordinary.\nDavid Bunch and Bill Tinsley envisioned this park, working tirelessly to gather our support and the support of countless members throughout the community. We are excited and honored to work alongside a talented team of volunteers to help lead this project from vision into reality. Together, we will create a place for our community to escape, engage, and explore in Central Florida. There is much work to be done, with more to come, and we hope you will follow along on this journey to create Bonnet Springs Park….a legacy for generations to come.\nBarney Barnett\nFounding Chairman, Board of Directors\nBoard Members\nBarney\nBarnett,\nChairman & Vice Chairman\nJean\nBunch,\nSecretary\nBill\nVass,\nTreasurer\nJohn\nAttaway,\nBoard Chair\nNick\nBarnett\nWesley\nBarnett\nMarcy\nBenton\nDavid\nBunch\nJeffrey\nCox, Sr.\nKimberly\nElmhorst\nDonna\nHenricks\nJustin\nHollis\nSara\nRoberts McCarley\nKathleen\nMunson\nTim\nRice\nMartha\nSantiago\nBill\nTinsley\nMartha\nTinsley\nStaff\nJosh\nHenderson\nCEO\nKirsten\nHein\nVice President of Engagement\nJennifer\nRoyal\nVice President of Finance\nWendy\nStephens\nSenior Director of Human Resources\nKellie\nPhillips\nDirector of Development\nStephanie\nBernal\nDirector of Events",
