      "text": "A Solvable Problem\nOur story started by wanting to solve a problem.\nFounded in 2015, Campspot was created to bring a modern booking experience to the camping industry. At that time, nearly half the campgrounds in the US were not taking reservations online and we believed we could help more people experience the great outdoors if we brought a modern solution to this problem. It was this same problem-solving spirit that drove us to launch the Campspot Marketplace in the winter of 2020, which has helped thousands of campers research and instantly book from over 130,000 campsites\nand counting.\nOh, and we believe we’re just getting started.\nCreating The Company We Love\nWe know that great teams are connected by great culture — which is why we take great care in caring for each other. Our core values came to be by assessing the actions and people we value today and whom we’ve valued along the way — as well as who we aim to be as we continue to grow and evolve.\nCore Value #1\nFirst and foremost, we’re all human. We respect and honor individuality, and prioritize each other and our customers. Camping is fun, after all!\nCore Value #2\nWhether it’s the destination, or the journey, we strive boldly in the direction of progress. We honor the path that has been paved and celebrate the growth that occurs blazing new trails.\nCore Value #3\nThe glow of a campfire starts with one small spark. We value passion and energy to get the job done, and the ability to inspire and motivate others along the way.\nCore Value #4\nWe hire great people and trust them to do great things. Set up camp, explore your surroundings, and ask for directions if you get lost.\nDriven by purpose. Inspired by each other.\nWe’re growing and always looking for passionate collaborators to help us achieve our mission. We’re looking to grow with people who embody our culture of learning, collaboration, and innovation. Check out our latest job opportunities.\nIf there aren’t currently any open positions that fit your skillset, we’d still love to hear from you! Email your resume and contact information to\ninfo@campspot.com\nand we'll reach out if anything becomes available.\nView Openings\nNew & Newsworthy\nWe think Campspot is worth talking about.
