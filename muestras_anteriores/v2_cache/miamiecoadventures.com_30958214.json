Since then, over 100,000 users have logged on. Due to the success of this pilot program, wireless service will be included in select future parks and in some parks being upgraded.\nThe success of the pilot program has reinforced the goal of Wireless Miami-Dade - to create an environment that is technologically appealing to residents, visitors and businesses; to establish and maintain a sense of community safety; and to reach out to underserved residents. So far, we've concentrated on providing municipal Wi-Fi to residents to shrink the economic obstacles associated with access and deployment. But, more importantly, we want to improve residents' experiences when utilizing County services. So, we began to ask ourselves: what else makes sense today?\nBased on our successful pilot program, we decided to expand our pilot to Metrorail and Metrobus. Since the pilot launch, wireless access has improved the transit experience for commuters, transit workers and has been an added convenience for the residents of Miami-Dade County. Wireless routers have been installed on four coaches serving a total of 20 trains throughout the entire rail network and in two 95 Express Buses.\nToday, riders can hop on a train or bus, and check e-mails, read the newspaper online, or just surf the web on laptops, hand held devices, Kindles and iPads - for free - before they even arrive at the office. It's all about convenience and making the Miami-Dade transit experience better.\nWe're moving forward… embracing new technology and improving service for our residents.\nOur Heritage\nMiami-Dade Parks began as a Division of the County Road and Bridge Department in 1929, planting trees along our community's highways. A.D. Barnes, a leader in the National Parks, Recreation and Open Space movement, persuaded Commodore Matheson to donate 80 acres of land for, the first county park, Matheson Hammock Park.\nMiami-Dade Parks now manages more than 13,500 acres and has more than 280 parks, recreational facilities and greenways. It continues to provide outstanding recreational facilities and programming to more than 2.5 million residents and visitors, making it one of the nation’s largest and busiest leisure service agencies.\nA three-time national Gold medal winner for excellence in Parks administration, it is the only municipal park system of its size to be awarded National Accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Parks, Recreation and Open Space Agencies.\nHeritage Parks\nParks are significant assets of a community's heritage. They are places of social and cultural gatherings, places of nature's beauty and places where we simply play.\nIn Miami-Dade, we have 75 years of parks that have enriched our lives and environment. Miami-Dade Parks is proud to preserve that heritage. We have designated seven parks that have played a vital role in this community's history, environment and recreational and cultural experiences.\nls:end[component-1597976999557]\nRow 02 - Column 02\nls:begin[component-1570807331881]\nHTML\nAccommodations for persons with disabilities\nTo request materials in accessible format, sign language interpreters, and/or any accommodation to participate in any Miami-Dade Parks sponsored program or meeting, contact Gisel Prado,\n305-755-7848\nor Gisel.Prado@miamidade.gov at least 7 days in advance to initiate your request.
