The ensemble has grown significantly over the years and performs annually at numerous civic and community events.\nThe band is recognized as one of the leading performing arts institution in the Treasure Coast. It is described as one of the most vibrant and innovative community band in South Florida. The band seeks to inspire the people and communities of the Treasure Coast and serves as a leader and beacon for the musical arts in Port St. Lucie.\nToday, the band is comprised of approximately 70 talented and dedicated musicians from the Treasure Coast in Florida. In addition to full time professional musicians and our local music teachers, members of the band include doctors, attorneys, business professionals, and outstanding local student instrumentalists.\nThe Port St. Lucie Community band was formed to enrich the arts and music life of the Treasure Coast. We prepare performances intended to inspire, entertain and educate a wide and diverse audience with the unique experience of live symphonic and popular music.\nREINVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITY\nBuilding community connections is perhaps the most important component of the band's mission and future. It is our civic duty to not only prepare and present experiences and resources that nurture a deep understanding of music and its connections to our daily lives but also to offer young musicians the opportunity to perfect their craft and further their education.\nTo this end, as a nonprofit organization, we use a portion of donations to create scholarships for young promising musicians looking to study music in college. Every year we award 1 to 3 scholarship to local deserving students pursuing a music education in college. Each gift goes to support the music you hear, the artistic quality you experience and ultimately enriches the cultural landscape of Port St. Lucie. The most visible impact of giving back is seen in our ability to deliver scholarships to ambitious students looking to grow and innovative their musical skills.\nWe are investing in our youth through our music programs, family concerts and support in arts education. We have developed a strong community outreach to cultivate an appreciation for the experience of live music and to provide support for music education at all age levels throughout the Treasure Coast. We are and hope to continue to reach a diverse audience with our masterworks concerts.\nMusic expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent.\nVictor Hugo\nHIRE A MUSICIAN\nMany of our very proficient musicians, outside of their band responsibilities, interact with the community by playing in small ensembles, performing in schools and at events such as weddings, fundraisers and even funerals. This diversifies the work of our professional musician and allows them to contribute to the community on a different and more personal level.\nIn addition, many of our musicians are music educators in our local schools and offer private lessons for children and adults. Lessons, for those looking to advance their understanding and musical skills, are a great opportunity to utilize the wonderful resource of having a community of professional musicians.\nFor information regarding availability and rates please contact us, at\ninfo@pslcommunityband.org.\n.four-columns - sidebar\nmfn_hook_content_after\nmfn_hook_content_after\n#Footer\nCopyrights\nThe Port St. Lucie Community Band | (860) 933-2960 | Providing Live Musical Entertainment For Port St. Lucie & The Treasure Coast.\n» Designed by Orlando Haddock.\n#Wrapper\nmfn_hook_bottom\nmfn_hook_bottom\nwp_footer()\nStart of StatCounter Code\nEnd of StatCounter Code",
