There are 974 homes nestled among a variety of native trees with spacious common grounds surrounding our eight lakes. Our lots average a generous 60′ by 80′.\nThe ultimate lifestyle on Florida’s Gulf Coast is located between Sarasota and Fort Myers with boat access to the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe community is a Resident Owned Community (ROC) operated by a co-operative that was formed by our residents to purchase the community and oversee its operation. A professional staff manages the community, and since they are not obligated to produce profits for absentee investors, their focus is on providing us, the residents, with a first class lifestyle.\nResidents have the option of purchasing a share in the cooperative or of renting the land under their home. Many styles of pre-owned homes are available; all are double wides with a utility room, covered carport, and screened rooms.\nWe believe that La Casa offers a great opportunity for active retirees, but don’t just take our word for it, we invite you to come and see for yourself.\nSouthwest Florida’s most impressive owner governed community\nLa Casa is an impeccably maintained isolated and self-contained oasis. It is convenient for shopping, sightseeing, golfing, fishing and boating, as well as all the culture and elegance the Southwest Florida area is noted for.\nResidents and visitors enjoy the warmth of Southwest Florida winters in a relaxed and unhurried environment far removed from the hustle of Florida’s east coast. You’ll be surrounded by hundreds of palms reaching for the sky and beautiful mature lush landscaping which demonstrates the utmost level of care our property receives from residents and management\nLa Casa may have the best pools in the area. An extremely large, 40 X 60-foot swimming pool is our crown jewel and is kept at a perfect 87 degrees. Our smaller 20 x 40 pool is quietly nestled between the clubhouse and the brand new Activity Building. Both pools have adjacent hot tubs which are perfect for soaking muscles that are tired from golfing or tennis. Wireless Internet (WiFi) is available at the Clubhouse, Activity Building and Recreation Hall area where these pools & spas are located, so you can catch some rays while you catch up on your email! Sound enticing?\nLa Casa is a friendly, family community. You will be away from the hustle and bustle except when you want to be part of it. When you leave our gates, North Port is only 1.5 miles from the city center, where you will find every kind of retail store and service you could need.\nCome for a visit or make us your home. We are waiting for you!\nShare on Facebook\nShare\nShare on Twitter\nTweet\nShare on Pinterest\nShare\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare\nAbout Us\nWe believe that La Casa is the finest Resident Owned Community in South West Florida\nLa Casa is a quiet senior community, just for persons 55 and up, located in North Port, Florida in Sarasota County.
