      "text": "welcome to hurricane patty's\nWaterfront dining featuring the freshest seafood, award-winning signature cocktails, and a deep connection to the rich history of Florida’s First Coast.\nShrimping is what shaped St. Augustine, Florida—from our local culture to the local flavor. As the largest shrimp port on the East coast, St. Augustine was also known as the largest producer of fishing vessels in the world. For decades, St. Augustine has supported the shrimpers, boat builders, and fisherman who called this port their home.\nHurricane Patty’s Waterfront Bar & Grill has been retrofitted in a 1920s historic fish house where fresh shrimp and fish were cleaned before they made their way to market. Later, shrimp boats were crafted here, too, built and balanced on railroad tracks until construction was finished and they were “rolled” -into into what the locals called “Oyster Creek.”.\nHere at Hurricane Patty’s we pay homage to our local and historic heritage. Today, we’re proud to be serving the freshest and finest seafood we can get our hands on, local if possible. Our warm and welcoming staff will make you feel right at home and our killer\naward-winning cocktails\n, like the Hurricane Category 5 or  Playing-it-Safe Datil Smoothie. They will hit the spot and make you feel like you’re always on Florida time.\nJoin us for live music by the water, oysters on the half-shell, our weekend Bloody Mary Bar, or an Open Mic night every Sunday. We’re always serving up daily specials and fresh seafood like our Coconut Rum Shrimp, Olde English Fish & Chips, Scallops, Lobster, or Grouper, in addition to salads, pastas, grilled meats, and our world-renowned appetizers that are bound to knock your socks off.\nOh! And, we hope you’re not afraid of ghosts—cause we’ve got one. Rumor has it, our restaurant is haunted. She’s a heartbroken woman still pining for her lover who never returned from sea. Can you hear her crying? Stop by and you may feel her sadness or even hear her slam the bathroom door...!\nLocation\n69 Lewis Blvd,\nSt. Augustine, FL 32084\nPhone\n(904) 342-7338\nEmail\ncontact@hurricane-pattys.com\nHours\nSun - Thurs: 11am - 9pm\nFri & Sat: 11am - 10pm\nSocial\nFresh Seafood on the Waterfront.\nMake a reservation",
