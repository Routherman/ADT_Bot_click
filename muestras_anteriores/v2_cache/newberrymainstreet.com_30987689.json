We were officially named in 1894 when our first post office was built. As we evolved into a mining town for phosphate industries we also grew as a community. More local businesses were established like drug stores, saloons and sawmills. Some of these early buildings are still used and seen in our town today.\nWith the initiative of hard working volunteers who have a passion to see Newberry grow and thrive, Newberry Main Street Organization (NMSO) was officially established in 2006. We are a non-profit organization that receives grants from the state as well as  sponsorships from the public. We strive to educate the public on our history, provide fun activities for the community, advocate to protect our historical footprint and help Main Street businesses thrive. NMSO enjoys networking with our local businesses and citizens, getting feedback on how we can continue to help the community and staying in touch with our hometown feel. Newberry Main Street Organization is a member of the State Florida Main Street, as well as the National Main Street Organization.\nLearn more about Newberry's history...\nIn the spring of 2025, students from UF's historic preservation program along with the guidance of Dr. Clarissa Carr took. a deep dive into Newberry history and locations around town.  You can. find more information.on the website they created\nhere\n.\nWe would like to sincerely thank and recognize Dr.  Carr and her students for their hard  work and dedication.
