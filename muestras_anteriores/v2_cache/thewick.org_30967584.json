Housing the original  wardrobes from over 35 Broadway productions and revivals, the museum has  entertained thousands of patrons in a relatively short period of time.  The two facilities now function together making the Wick Theatre and  Costume Museum an arts cornerstone in Palm Beach County.\nOur Story\nWhen the former Caldwell Theatre closed last year, it left what  Marilynn Wick called “a gaping hole in the South Florida theater  scene.”\nWick — owner of Costume World, the Costume World Broadway  Collection and creator of a major theater gear rental firm — and her  daughters, Kim and Kelly, are using their performance and business savvy  to revive the Boca Raton cultural arts center.\nThe former Caldwell — shuttered and silent since spring 2012 when  a bankruptcy receiver evicted the company and closed the doors on the  $10 million North Federal Highway building — will once again resound  with songs and dialogue. On Sept. 19, Marilynn and her daughters will  reopen the venue as The Wick Theatre & Costume Museum with a  production of\nThe Sound of Music\n. Equity husband-and-wife duo Krista Severeid and Tony Lawson head a cast of 28.\nThe back end of the Caldwell building has been gutted to  accommodate Wick’s Broadway Collection Museum, which “basically outgrew  the space in Pompano Beach,” she said. “The idea of moving it to Boca  and making it a true multipurpose arts facility was very exciting.”\nSeeing the lifeless Caldwell touched the entrepreneur’s heart. “I drove by pretty regularly,” she said. “It was simply a tragedy  to see that beautiful building sitting empty — particularly in light of  the wonderful work the Caldwell had done for so many years. That’s when  I got the idea to move my costume museum to the location and reopen the  theater.” Refurbishing involved “a near-total renovation of the interior  and exterior entrances for the new museum,” she said. “The frantic pace  has been palpable.”\nItems moved from Pompano to Boca include original costumes from  more than 35 Broadway productions and revivals. In all, Wick has  accumulated some 1.2 million pieces. The collection includes wardrobes from original Broadway productions of\nThe Producers\nand\nTitanic\n; the Sarah Jessica Parker production of\nOnce upon a Mattress\n,\nLa Cage aux Folle\ns and the Julie Andrews performance of\nMy Fair Lady\n, with designs by Cecil Beaton.\n-Article by\nDale King\nAbout The Wick\nIn April of 2013, Marilynn Wick acquired the former Caldwell Theatre space in north Boca Raton.\nResurrecting the vacant property into the Wick Theatre and Costume Museum which opened for business in  September with its inaugural production of\nThe Sound of Music\n.\nThe production was heralded by the press and patrons alike, making the  Wick Theatre a formidable contender in professional theatre in South  Florida despite its newcomer status.The Costume Museum followed suit in November, opening its doors to  nearly sold-out crowds in early November of 2013.

Marilynn   hails from a small town in western Pennsylvania and early on learned the importance   of hard work and forward thinking. After earning her real estate license in three   states, Marilynn relocated to Florida with her two daughters. She soon became very   successful, owning and operating both a high rig construction cleaning company, and   an international salvage business. She began to see the potential in the costume  rental industry and from a beginning of only five Santa suits, Costume World was   born. It is Marilynn’s vision and energy that has brought prestigious clients such as   Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, Busch Gardens, Coca Cola, the US   Army Entertainment and hundreds of esteemed regional theatres to Costume World.   It is interesting to note that without a degree in theatre or any formal design training,   that Marilynn was nominated for the prestigious Jefferson Award for costume design   awarded yearly in Chicago for her designs for Singing in the Rain in 1990. With four   facilities located throughout the United States, Costume World leads the way as the   largest distributor of theatrical in the United States.\nIn April of 2013, Mrs. Wick acquired the former Caldwell Theatre Company space in   north Boca Raton, resurrecting the vacant property into the Wick Theatre and Costume Museum.
