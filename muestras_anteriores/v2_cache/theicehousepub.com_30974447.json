With a full British themed menu of such staples as Fish 'n Chips, Cottage Pie, Bangers and Mash and the American favorites Cheese Burgers, Steak Sandwiches and Giant Salads.\nBuilt in the 1890s, the structure was used as an ice plant for the fishing industry. Over the years, it has changed owners and businesses. For a while, it had sat empty. Hurricane Charley all but destroyed the building when it tore the roof off and the south wall collapsed, but the building's owner's refused to demolish this South Florida landmark pledging to rebuild it and they did.\nThe Ice House Pub is truly a uniquely British destination steeped in South Florida history that everyone should plan to visit.\nHops and Barley Patio\nCome relax on our Hop and Barley Patio.\n//CONTENT\nLEFT COLUMN\nIceHouse Menu\nHome\nBeer, Wine & Cocktails\nDraft Beers\nBottled Beers, Wines & Cocktails\nBeer Encyclopedia\nFood Menu\nStarters\nEntrees\nLunch Features\nDarts\nDarts at the IceHouse\nCo-ed League\nShopping\nPub Fashion\nGift Cards\nAbout\nOn Tap\nSee the\nCurrent Tap List\n, with Real time display of our kegs, at the IceHouse Pub!\nON TAP\nThe IceHouse is now on Facebook.\nJoin us!\nFind us on Twitter.\nPonder our Tweets\n!\nPub Wisdom\nOf all my favorite things to do, my utmost is to have a brew!\nPub News\nThe IceHouse has\nFree Wireless Internet!\n0\nEmployment\nThe IceHouse is currently taking applications\nComplete the Employment Application Form and Mail To:\nIce House Pub, Inc\n408 Tamiami Trail North\nPunta Gorda, FL 33950\nApplication\n//LEFT COLUMN\n//MAIN CONTAINER\nYou are here:\nHome\nAbout\nTop\nSkip to content\nAUTO EQUAL WIDTH\nDirections\nGet Directions to the IceHouse\nOpening Hours\nOpen 7 Days a Week\n11am to 11pm.\n<div class=\"open\">\r\n<div class=\"open-days\">Sunday</div>\r\n<div class=\"open-hours\">12pm to 11pm</div>\r\n</div>\nContact the IceHouse\nPhone:\n941-575-0866\nEmail:\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
