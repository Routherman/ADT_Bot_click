      "text": "// CATEGORY NAV\nWith southern flair and a contemporary twist, the Restaurant IRON dining experience elevates Downtown Pensacola’s culinary offerings to new standard. The theme is locally-sourced, hand-made, and detail-focused for every recipe prepared in our open kitchen and presented by knowledgeable and professional staff in a comfortable, yet elegant, southern-inspired setting.\nIRON opened in the Summer of 2012 at Marcus Pointe Golf Club. Initially a lunch-only location, demand quickly called for an expansion to add dinner service, which was added in the Fall. When Marcus Pointe changed management in 2014, it was time for IRON to find a new, more centralized home. In December of 2014, IRON opened at its current location of 22 N Palafox St. in beautiful Downtown Pensacola.\nRestaurant IRON has received several awards and much recognition since its inception.  For the last four years, IRON was the recipient of Florida Trend Magazine's Golden Spoon Award. Additionally, the IN Weekly and the Pensacola News Journal have recognized Restaurant IRON for numerous awards in its yearly reader poll, including Best Restaurant in Pensacola. Restaurant IRON has also been recognized over the years by OpenTable, including receiving their Diners’ Choice award and listed as the Top 100 in the Nation in their “Fit for Foodies” category.  Most recently, Restaurant IRON has been recognized by Garden & Gun Magazine and listed by Forbes in their article, \"50 Best Southern Restaurants in America” and recognized by OpenTable in their “100 Most Romantic Restaurants in America.”\nRestaurant IRON has been recognized in 2022 & 2023 by Wine Spectator Magazine as recipient of their Award of Excellence for our wine program.",
