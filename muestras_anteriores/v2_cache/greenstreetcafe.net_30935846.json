      "text": "It is rare not to encounter athletes, local politicians, artists or simply thousands of locals enjoying just that, LIFE, at GreenStreet.\nBreakfast is a must, but so is lunch, dinner and the late night as it is GreenStreet’s philosophy to always serve good food.\nAt GreenStreet, whether inside or on our amazing terrace, chill, unwind, people watch and comfort your palate.\n“Most people in the Grove might be surprised to find out that there is even an inside to the\nGreenStreet Café\n. It’s nice enough, but, really, you’re missing half the fun if you’re not on a plush velvet couch along Main Highway or under umbrellas alongside Commodore Plaza in plain sight of slow moving rubberneckers. GreenStreet manages to mix regulars, with locals of note (celebs, athlete and politicos) and even tourists in equal measure.\nThe menu\nis similarly eclectic and draws crowds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The happy hour offerings, regular and late night, are plentiful with daily specials.”\nBest Sunday Brunch\nMiami New Times\n“Sidewalk spots don’t get more popular (and many say more delicious) than GreenStreet, where the Grove’s young and gregarious congregate at sunset. The menu of high-end pub fare ranges from roasted vegetable and goat cheese lasagna and mesclun endive salad to blackened mahimahi and braised short ribs with polenta. It’s also a great late-night eating and drinking spot. Happy hour specials draw in the crowds.”\nAmerican in Coconut Grove\nLonely Planet\n“Leisurely sidewalk dining” is the draw at this “fun corner spot” with zany, oversized “red sofas” in the “\nheart of Coconut Grove\n”, where “good”, moderately priced Mediterranean-influenced fare is served with a side of “fabulous people-watching”; weekend brunch is “a big hit with the locals”, so “go early” or “be prepared to wait!”\nBustling American Eatery with a Big Menu\nZagat\nLooking For The Best Accommodations In Coconut Grove?
