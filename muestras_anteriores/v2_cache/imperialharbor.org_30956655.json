Because of that, we have very limited hours.  Office hours and days are posted at the bottom of every page on this site.  They hours change based on season, but it's always open on Wed of each week.\nFirst, we have limited availability for new membership.  It doesn't mean we don't have it, but you will need to check with the office and see what is available.\nDownload your application form for quick and easy process.\nIf your home came with a club membership upon purchasing, congratulations, you can transfer the certificate into your name.  You will need to bring that into the office, along with a copy of your deed and IDs such as a Drivers License of Passport.  Access to Club facilities will not be available until after your certificate has been transferred over.\nIf you are applying for a brand new membership, meaning your house didn't come with it at the time of sale, then there will be a $1,500 one time fee to join.  This fee is refundable if you ever choose to sell your membership back to the club.  Annual fees are $350 per year. This fee grants access to our swimming pool, gym, billiard room, shuffle board courts and Bocce ball.  It also allows you to attend the many events in the clubhouse as well as games and more.\nMembership renewal is sent out by email every year around Nov 15 and can be paid online (preffered method), mail with check, or in the office.\nWe do not accept cash for membership renewals.\nNew electronic membership access cards will be available for office pick up when announded available.  It will be a different color from previous years. New cards take effect as of Jan 1 that year.\nAs a club member, we recommend you join our\nHarbor Club Facebook\ngroup.  We will post club news, upcoming events, trips, games and special dinners/dance.  Club members will not be able to post directly to the group.  We are trying to keep it simple and information only. You can post a question but it will require approval to go live.  If its a simple question, then we will answer it directly to you.\nFor social, selling stuff,\nquestions that are non-club related\n, making friends, we suggest you join the\nImperial Harbor Facebook\ngroup.  This is for ALL residents and not just club members.  Because of that, no club information/questions will be posted or communicated on that group.\nOnce a month during season, we have a general assembly.  During this meeting, you will have the opportunity to vote on proposed projects, find out about enhancements and the financial state of our clubhouse.  We need you to make every effort to attend when you are in town. These meetings are usually 1-hour or less.\nIn addition to above, here are some additional basic information.\nPOOL:\nHours are from dawn to dusk, but understand, we do not have paid staff.  EVERYTHING is based on you volunteering.  We encourage new people to volunteer when asked as a way to make friends.  Sign-up sheets can be found near the entrance to the bathrooms by the pool or inside bulletin board.  We ask for volunteers to open and close the pool.  Because of that, the time is flexible.  The pool will remain closed during weather issues.  For instance, during a tropical storm or hurricane, we will need volunteers to help secure outdoor furnitures.  When the pool has been inspect for damage or debris, the pool can open and we will need volunteers again to put outdoor furniture out.  During a cold spell, the pool will remain closed until the temperatures warm up.  Usually you can expect anything below 67 F to cause the pool to remain closed.\nVOLUNTEER!\nThis club has managed to keep it's dues low due to your neighbors willing to volunteer.  If we didn't have volunteers, thus hiring staff, your dues would go up.  Our busiest time is during season, which falls between Nov - Mar of every year.  We encourage seasonal people to volunteer during those months.  We have permanent residents as well and they usually volunteer off season.\nEVENTS:\nSpecial activities or events usually require you to sign up.  This will be in the form of a sign-up sheet located inside the club house.  Posts on Facebook Events are curtesy notifications only and do not count as signing up for the event. This will help our volunteers know how much food, space will be required.  We have limited seating at some events and it will be on a first come, first serve basis.  Some events will have the ability to pay online via this website.  If that is the case, your payment is your sign up.\nSPECIAL EVENTS TICKET SALES:\nFrom time to time, we host special events, such as a dance party or entertainment.  This events require advance purchase of tickets.  Most of the times the tickets will be sold out and can't be purchased at the door.  The club Facebook and newsletter will be the best way to get information about these events. You can buy tickets via our website, but you must register first.  Also volunteers will sell them during cafe or lunch events (check club calendar) and during office hours.  In person we accept cash or checks, online you can use bank transfer or credit/debit card.\nHARBORITE NEWSLETTER:\nWe also publish a monthly newsletter that is available on our website, club Facebook and limited printed copies in the library next to the office.  This is a great source of information on happenings and events.\nInstanceEndEditable\nVisit Us:\nHarbor Club Of Bonita Springs\n26230 Imperial Harbor Boulevard, Bonita Springs, Florida 34135\nContact Us\nOffice Hours:\nWednesday: 9am - 12pm\nOct thru April\nWednesday 9:30-11:30\nMay thru Sept\nBonita Springs, FL WEATHER",
