      "text": "FAQs\nAbout our VPAs\nWhat is the Visual and Performing Arts Program?\nBooker High Schools’ Visual and Performing Arts Program, also known as the VPA, is Sarasota County’s first magnet program in our public schools. This means that students who are accepted into our program can attend Booker High School no matter where they live inside or outside of our district.\nA pre-professional magnet arts program, the VPA is over 50 years old and has been the starting point for such careers as Academy-award winning makeup artist Bill Corso, Broadway performer Syesha Mercado, and actors Jeff Meachum, Charlie Barnett, and Ollie Haaskivi, among many others.\nHow much time does a student spend in their discipline?\nAn intensive arts program, students spend three periods a day in their chosen field for the entirety of their high school career as they take courses to deepen their craft, work with guest artists from around the world, and experience once-in-a-lifetime opportunities from our extensive partnerships.\nCan I audition for more than one discipline?\nYes, students are able to audition for more than one discipline, but please contact us to coordinate this.\nWhy are arts classes important for my student?  What if my student does not pursue a career in the arts?\nResearch has shown that arts education makes for better learners, in and out of the art classroom.  These learners have creative problem-solving skills, mental flexibility and excellent interpretation skills, all important for the workforce of the future. Studies have shown a link between students of the arts and high cognitive ability. Finally, students tend to feel confident and happy in VPA classes, often finding a place where their brilliance can be developed. These are important qualities for whatever endeavor they choose, arts related or not.\nWhat makes the VPA different from other arts offerings at other schools?\nThe VPA offers an intensive curriculum designed for pre-professional studies for students hoping to pursue the arts after high school. Students have three classes every day in their chosen discipline to hone their craft. The arts curricula are rigorous, hands-on, and designed to develop well-rounded students of the arts. Also, students have plenty of performance and exhibition opportunities both on campus and around town.\nHow are VPA teachers different from other art teachers?\nVPA teachers are practitioners of the disciplines they teach. Thus, they are passionate, lifelong learners of the arts, constantly honing their skills and keeping up with art trends and techniques. This up-to-date knowledge is shared with students. VPA teachers also are affiliated with various professional and community arts organizations, including the Ringling College of Art + Design, Sarasota Contemporary Dance Company, the Sarasota Orchestra, the Asolo Repertory Theater, Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe, The Ringling Museum, the Van Wezel and Sarasota Performing Arts Foundation, among many others. These connections enable teachers to expose students to truly unique opportunities.\nWhat are the facilities like for the VPA program?\nBooker opened its $58 million campus in January 2013, which features college-like courtyards and attractive classroom buildings, as well as state-of-the-art arts studios, science labs and learning facilities. In 2024, Booker will reopen its newly renovated VPA Center that houses classroom spaces, construction labs, and both a mainstage and studio theatre that are truly state-of-the-art. Students will be learning, performing and exhibiting their work in this $22 million center that pays homage to the namesake to all three Booker schools, Emma E. Booker.\nAbout Booker High\nWhat is the learning environment like at Booker High School?\nBooker is proud to offer a diverse community of learners, with students coming to Booker High from all different backgrounds, which offers a cultural melting pot and a harmonious learning environment. Additionally, Booker offers the lowest student-to-teacher ratio, fostering personalized learning and differentiated instruction.\nWhat academic programs does Booker High School offer?\nBooker is proud to offer the full\nCambridge AICE (Advanced International Certificate of Education) Diploma program\n, which offers students rigorous, college-prep courses in three main areas – arts/humanities, language and math/sciences – that compromise core classes as well as elective courses. A student can earn college credits accepted by more than 970 universities and colleges nationwide. Additionally, Booker offers Dual Enrollment courses through the State College of Florida, University of South Florida, University of Florida and select Advanced Placement courses.\nFAQs\nAbout our VPAs\nWhat is the Visual and Performing Arts Program?\nBooker High Schools’ Visual and Performing Arts Program, also known as the VPA, is Sarasota County’s first magnet program in our public schools.
