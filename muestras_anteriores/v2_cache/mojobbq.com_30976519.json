      "text": "Have You Found Your Mojo?\nThe Mojo experience ignited in 2003 and since then has blazed across North and Central Florida into eight locations. “Mojo” comes from the Blues, denoting a good luck feeling or vibe, and when it was paired with barbecue, a divergent atmosphere erupted.\nWhen you hang out in any Mojo location, you can expect to hear great music, sit under local art, and visit with members of the Mojo family, all the while enjoying a plate full of meats smoked in-house and homemade sides.\nThe Mojo goal was to be able to offer an array of regional barbecue styles in one place and with their own personal touches, and they’ve been able to do just that! From North Carolina to Texas, you can find anything you like at Mojo.\nIn 2011, Mojo took their first serious step towards a whiskey and craft cocktail bar. The fourth location, Mojo no. 4 Urban BBQ and Whiskey Bar, is nestled in Avondale’s historic district and hosts the first collection of whiskey and bourbon Mojo owns.\nWhen they were met with great bar success, Mojo knew they needed to move forward with whiskey, and with each new location opened, the bar got larger than its predecessor. They even installed a much-desired whiskey bar in their second location on Jacksonville Beach in 2014, eight years after they opened.\nThe bar scene wasn’t the only thing increasing in the Mojo world. In the last few years, Mojo catering has expanded to large festivals, major events, and elegant weddings. There was a demand for good barbecue and southern food at home, and Mojo delivered.\nWhen you’re looking for killer food in a laid back, one-of-a-kind atmosphere, and you’re looking to get your mojo workin’… you can find it at any of the eight Mojo locations in Jacksonville, St. Augustine, Gainesville, Ocala, and Lakeland.\nFind Your Mojo\nWe ordered dinner to go. It was sooo good! Delicious and flavorful meals. Order was accurate and on point. Mojos and football turned out to be an awesome combo.\nTina\nLITERALLY HEAVEN. I have been dreaming about these since I had them and now want to have you guys cater our wedding.\nAlexa Hellstrom\nAMAZING! We moved from Massachusetts to Ocala and the Southern Kitchen is our new favorite! This is definitely a generous portion and my husband loves the Pulled Pork Shoulder with BBQ beans and coleslaw.\nA.E.
