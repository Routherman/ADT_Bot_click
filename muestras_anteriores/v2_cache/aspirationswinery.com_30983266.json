      "text": "About Aspirations\nMaking Wine Since\n2010\nEstablished by Robin & Bill Linville in October 2010, Aspirations Winery embodies a dream realized in Clearwater, Florida.\nBill, a former banker with seven years in the industry and a Navy veteran of the Presidential Honor Guard, teamed up with his graphic artist wife, Robin, to bring their shared vision to life. Their journey began after years of juggling multiple jobs, seeking the right business venture to call their own.\nTheir quest led them to a serendipitous discovery: the world of “clean” wine. Bill, plagued by wine-induced headaches and suspecting a sulfite allergy, learned about the necessity of additives and preservatives in wine aging. Disheartened by the lack of transparency in labeling and the prevalence of sulfites in wines, they resolved to offer a healthier alternative to their community.\nHaving experienced the refreshing absence of side effects, including “hangovers,” from clean wine, they were inspired to share this revelation with others. Thus, Aspirations Winery was born, initially nestled in Temple Terrace near USF before finding its permanent home in Clearwater in December 2011.\nThe Art of Wine Making\nToday, Aspirations Winery boasts a collection of over 35 low-sulfite wines, ranging from dry reds and whites to fruit-infused varieties, specialty sangrias, and decadent dessert wines.
