It’s a hub where countless stories of creative pioneers come together to enlighten locals and travelers while inspiring them to new adventures of their own. Luminary Hotel & Co. is the beating heart of the city where you can become part of a storyline that’s always being written.\nQuirky Characters\nThe banks of the Caloosahatchee have seen the arrival of countless individuals looking to explore the possibilities of Fort Myers. There are so many inspiring and entertaining stories surrounding the luminaries who built Fort Myers. Some of their contributions are captured in these fanciful illustrations brought to life by local artist\nJoshua Noom\n. Look closely, there are unexpected plot twists and cameo appearances!\nThe Caloosahatchee\nThe river and its inhabitants are such a crucial part of the area’s historical landscape. To this day, its gentle current evokes an appreciation for taking your time to enjoy where you are just as much as where you are going.\nCapt. Francis A. Hendry\nAsk any local of Fort Myers and they’re bound to know about the Hendry family. The patriarch came to the area by way of a cattle drive (and war), and established a home. His charisma quickly made him an influential member of the town.\nAlice McCann\nFrom her switchboard above the Heitman General Store, Alice became the first telephone operator in Fort Myers. Her penchant for exchanging more than just phone lines also made her the woman who heard and shared everything — and we mean everything.\nTootie McGregor\nWhile her nickname is something of a mystery, Tootie’s legacy can be felt on every road — literally. With an eye for business and a generous heart, she worked behind the scenes to invest in the beautification and paving of her beloved town. Today, she is known as the ‘Mother of Fort Myers.’\nLuminary:\nA person who inspires or influences others, especially one prominent in a particular sphere.\nIn the center of Fort Myers sits more than just a hotel.
