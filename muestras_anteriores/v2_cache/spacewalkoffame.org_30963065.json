With a downtown redevelopment program in progress to enhance the riverfront, the suggestion was welcomed by the council and the Titusville Community Redevelopment Agency. The idea resulted in the formation of the U.S. Space Walk of Fame Foundation, a non-profit organization.\nLed by space pioneers, community leaders and former space workers, foundation officials cooperated with the city which provided park infrastructure while the foundation oversaw monument development, plaques, mission logo markers and other space related items to complete the space themed park on the Indian River across from the Kennedy Space Center.\n2001 – Museum Created\nThe foundation created the\nU.S. Space Walk of Fame Museum\n, which, in October 2016, was renamed the American Space Museum.\n1994 – Space View Park Dedicated\nIn July 1994, the city of Titusville completed and dedicated the new riverfront park named\nSpace View Park\n, to provide the anchor point for the U.S. Space Walk of Fame monuments.\n1995 through 2014 – Monuments Constructed, Donated and Dedicated\nThrough grants, memberships, donations from companies and individuals, fundraisers and other sources not considered normal revenue, the foundation eventually completed five monuments placed in Space View Park and\ndonated them to the City of Titusville\n.\nThe\nMercury Monument\nwas dedicated on May 12, 1995, and the Mercury mission logos were unveiled May 23, 1997.\nShuttle Monument at Space View Park, Titusville, FL\nThe\nGemini Monument\ngroundbreaking was July 19, 1996, and was dedicated on Nov. 7, 1997.\nThe\nApollo Monument\ngroundbreaking was held on July 16, 1999, at precisely 9:32 a.m., exactly 30 years after “Lift Off” of Apollo XI. The groundbreaking kicked off a week-long, 30-year anniversary celebration of the Apollo XI launch and the first moon landing. The Apollo Monument dedication was held in May 2007.\nIn the Line of Duty Monument\nThe\nShuttle Monument\ngroundbreaking was held in May 2012, and the dedication was in November 2014.\n2024:\nAn International Space Station pylon is planned for the Shuttle Monument area.\nEngraving Orders\nare being taken.\n2016 – Museum renamed to American Space Museum\nIn October 2016, the museum was renamed to the\nAmerican Space Museum.\nCurrent Projects\nThe foundation is now focusing on enhancements to the American Space Museum\nexhibits\nand\neducational programs\n.\nWe also continue to maintain the\nName Directories\nand websites for the monuments and arrange for\nNew Name Engraving\n.\nSo, with that being said.
