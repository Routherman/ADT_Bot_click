The name has been chosen for a couple of important reasons. First of all, in most families back in Eastern Europe, Babushka is usually a person who cooks the best food. It is always a warm experience coming to your Babushka house, sharing the great food and love. And that's the qualities we want to emphasize at Babushka's - great homemade food and a warming, home-like atmosphere full of joy and love.\nBabushka's Story\nAt Babushka's, we serve a wide variety of Russian and Eastern European dishes. You can find anything from classic Borscht and Pierogi to sweet and savory Blinchiki (Russian Crêpes), Piroshki and homemade Honey Cake here! Babushka's offers brunch, lunch and dinner and always happy to surprise our lovely guests with great specials! Babushka's also accepts special orders and ready to make any of your food fantasy a reality. Visit us today and we can assure you that you will not be disappointed with Babushka's kitchen!\nSince 2018\nBabushka's story has began in 2018, when an international student from Russia at USF has noticed a very interesting fact: Russian & Eastern European food overall is strongly underrepresented in the United States, particularly in Florida and Tampa Bay Area. You could find a wide variety of international cuisines here, but not Eastern European. Knowing that the cuisine is absolutely unique and, most importantly, tasty, a student convinced his family to open a first restaurant in Tampa Bay, serving authentic and homemade Russian and Ukrainian cuisines.\nAbout Us\nThe restaurant name comes from the Russian word [Bábushka], literally translating as \"Grandmother\".
