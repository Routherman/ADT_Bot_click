The Town is a rural environment, filled with grazing animals, nurseries, farms, exquisite and unique scenery and an abundance of wildlife.\nThe zoning in the Town is almost entirely rural residential and agricultural. We also have a growing amount of zoning for recreation and open space, which preserves land for residents’ enjoyment. The newest zoning district is for community facilities that serve the community.\nSouthwest Ranches was formed to stop encroaching development, and “Preserve Our Rural Lifestyle,” which includes donkeys braying, roosters crowing, and no sidewalks.\nTown Hall Address:\n13400 Griffin Road, Southwest Ranches, FL 33330\n(954) 434-0008\n954-434-1490\nTown Hall is open from 8:00 A.M. until 5:30 P.M., Monday – Thursday and 8:00 A.M. until 4:00 P.M.

As a result of this grassroots effort, the State Legislature passed a bill in the 1997 session calling for a vote of the citizens of Southwest Ranches in March of 2000.\nOn July 3, 1999, many of the Southwest Ranches Homeowners Associations sponsored a parade and picnic to declare the area’s independence. Many local, state and federal representatives spoke at the event which was a huge success!\nThe Town’s name came about through a local contest. The contest was to come up with a name for the newly formed city. The response was great and 122 different names were submitted. A vote was held on October 12, 1999 to select one of the top five names, and the Town of Southwest Ranches won. Many of the Southwest Ranches Homeowners Association members voted to move forward and request a local bill to allow incorporation in 2000 instead of 2001, and the bill was approved by the Legislature.\nOn March 14, 2000, residents voted overwhelmingly to form a new Town rather than be annexed. The next step for a new city would be the creation of its CHARTER. The CHARTER was to be drawn up and an election forming the city held in 2001. However, leaders realized that if a CHARTER could be drawn up sooner, it could possibly be approved as early as 2000. A CHARTER committee was formed to draw up a city CHARTER. The committee met almost weekly during July, 1999, August, 1999, and formulated a new CHARTER. On June 6, 2000, the CHARTER was approved by the residents and the city became one of thirty municipalities.\nCouncil Members were elected on July 25, 2000, and the Town was officially in business.\nDemographics\nPopulation\n: Approx. 7,923 (according to 2020 US Census Report)\nArea\n: Approx. 13 square miles\nCounty\n: Broward\nGovernment\n: Council-Administrator\nLocation\n: 15 miles southwest of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; 12 miles north of Miami/Dade County; 15 minutes from Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International AIRPORT\nHousing\n: Single-family dwellings; home range from $200,000 to over $1 million\nCharacteristics\n: Southwest Ranches is predominantly residential home sites with a minimum of one and two and one-half acres.
