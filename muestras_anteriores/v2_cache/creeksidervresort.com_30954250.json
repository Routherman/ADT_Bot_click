My wife (Jenni) and I will celebrate our 33rd anniversary this June. We have three grandchildren we love spending time with. I enjoy reading books, and my favorite candy is Reece’s Peanut Buttercups. I spent the last year working in the front office at Creekside, where I got to know many of you well. As I previously indicated, I am incredibly excited about the upcoming winter season and my role in making it the best season yet.\nKathleen\nYou may remember Kathleen from last season. She is our Assistant manager/Front Office staff member. Kathy would like you to know that she is from Rockville Centre, New York, and has lived in Punta Gorda full-time for 7 years and part-time for 30+ years. Kathy loves baking, going to the beach, boating, golfing, the mountains, and four-wheeling. She has been married for 38 years; her family is her utmost treasure.\nSarah\nSarah is also familiar to many, having worked as a Front Office staff member last season. Sara hails from Cincinnati, OH. She and her husband (Dan) moved to SWFL last August. They have two adult children, and Sara’s career was as a registered nurse. She loves palm trees and nature, spending time outside, especially by the water, popcorn, new adventures, and craft beer.\nAmanda\nAmanda is a new addition to the front office staff. She not only handles office-related issues, but she will be our Activities Coordinator for the upcoming season. Amanda would like you to know that she was born and raised in Florida by a scuba diving instructor, so she always says she could swim before she could walk. Her passions focus on mind, body, and soul wellness, and she consistently tries to bring a positive mindset wherever she is. She loves dancing, watercolor painting, junk journaling, and baking cookies. I’ve heard she makes a pretty good Snickerdoodle!\nLeticia\nLeticia is our Cleaning Specialist. She has been in SWFL for approximately 1 year. She is married and has a passion for music and chocolate.\nAustin\nMany of you may remember Austin, and we’re pleased to announce that he’s rejoining our team! Austin is the Maintenance Manager here at Creekside and is always eager to lend a helping hand. He has been married to his high school sweetheart for 14 years and is the proud father of three boys. He enjoys fishing and never turns down a good slice of cheesecake.\nCamp\nCamp is Creeksides’ additional maintenance/grounds crew member. Having lived his entire life in Punta Gorda, Camp is what we Floridians affectionately call FloGrown. He also loves hunting and fishing. His favorite dessert is anything ending in cake.\nJoin Our Team\nWe are always on the lookout for dedicated, hard-working people who share our commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. We offer excellent career opportunities with competitive salaries and exceptional employer benefits.\nName\nPhone\nEmail\nAvailability\nUpload Resume\nApply\n.entry-content .clear\n#post-##\n.entry-header\nMeet the Creekside RV Resort Team\nEric\nMy name is Eric, I have been a SW Floridian since 1989.
