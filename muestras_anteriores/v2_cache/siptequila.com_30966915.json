After checkout, you’ll receive an onboarding email or sms that explains how to access member benefits.\nDo I need to have an account to access membership?\nYes. Once you sign up, you’ll be prompted to create an account (or sign in to your existing account). Use the same email or phone number (we recommend you provide both)  that you used to purchase Membership. This is how you will access your benefits when checking out and manage your membership.\nHow do I access The Vault and other member-only products?\nIn order to access The Vault and Member-Only products, you will be given access to a private collection when it's opened and available to shop. While The Vault is now members only-it is still first come, first serve. In order to not miss these exclusive drops, make sure you are signed up today.\nWiil my Member benefits work with my Tequila Club or Subscription purchase?\nAt this time, Sip Membership benefits will apply to your first initial subscription purchase but\nWILL NOT\napply to your future recurring shipments. However, this is something we’re actively working on, as we want to provide added value for those who shop with us through subscriptions as well. Stay tuned—we’re excited about what’s to come!\nWhat’s the difference between The Sip Membership and the Tequila Club?\nThe Sip Membership and the Tequila Club are two different ways to enjoy Sip Tequila—each with its own perks depending on how you like to shop.\nThe\nSip Membership\nis an annual paid program ($149/year) designed for customers who like to choose their own bottles and shop à la carte throughout the year. Members get exclusive benefits like free standard shipping on all orders, access to seasonal gifts, complimentary engraving on select bottles, early access to limited releases via The SIP Vault, special promotions, and invites to member-only events.\nThe\nTequila Club\nis our subscription-based offering, where you receive curated tequila shipments every one, two, or three months. You pick the tier and frequency, and we handle the rest—introducing you to new bottles and limited selections with every delivery. It’s a great way to explore a variety of tequilas without having to choose them yourself.\nHow do I receive free engraving and how many bottles can I engrave with my Membership?\nFree engraving on eligible bottles is applied directly at checkout when you are logged into your account. Members can engrave up to 2 order per order. 8x per year ($200 value).\nHow do I redeem my free seasonal gift?\nEach season, Sip Members receive a complimentary gift with purchase ($60 min) each season (4x/year) as part of your benefits. We will email you after signing up with a link to add this gift to your cart and when a new gift is launched each season—just make sure you’re signed up to receive SMS messages from us. We’ll send a direct link to the seasonal gift along with your code straight to your phone for easy access.\nSimply add the product to your cart and apply your discount code at checkout. Be sure to use your Membership phone number or email address and apply the discount code. The code is valid only when used with your Membership account and requires a min $60 one-time purchase to redeem. Gift cannot be applied to subscription purchases-including Tequila Club.  You can redeem one gift per quarter, and the benefit resets on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st each year.\nIs the membership fee a recurring charge?\nMembers pay $149 each year for access to the membership program. The membership will auto-renew annually until you decide to cancel. You can cancel your membership’s auto-renewal at any time through your\naccount portal\nor by contacting info@siptequila.com.\nWill I keep my discount when my membership renews?\nWhile you can save $50 for a limited time and enjoy all The Sip Membership benefits for the year - your membership will return to the non-discounted $149 price upon renewal.\nCan I pause my membership?\nNo, we do not support pausing or skipping your membership at this time. However, you can cancel and rejoin the membership at any time.\nCan I return my membership or request a refund?\nAll purchases of the membership are final and cannot be returned or refunded.
