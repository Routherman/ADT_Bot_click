Our roots can be traced to 1888 and the founder of the Moose, Dr. Henry Wilson, who successfully established the first Lodge in Louisville, Kentucky. In the early years, the Moose was to serve a modest goal of offering men an opportunity to gather socially, to care for one another’s needs and celebrate life together.\nSince those early years, our fraternal  organization rapidly expanded to include valuable service to our communities, care for children and teens in need at Mooseheart Child City & School , a 1,000-acre campus, located 40 miles west of Chicago and care for our senior members at Moosehaven, a 70-acre retirement community near Jacksonville, Florida.\nWith a membership of over 1,000,000 members, our presence is felt in over 1,500 communities across all 50 states and four Canadian provinces, plus Great Britain. The Moose organization contributes between $75 to $100 million worth of community service (counting monetary donations, volunteer hours worked and miles driven) annually.\nIn addition to Mooseheart and Moosehaven, the Moose Fraternity’s Heart of the Community effort is multifaceted with internally developed programs like Tommy Moose. Tommy Moose aids in helping children overcome fears and anxiety during times of stress. Donated to law enforcement, fire fighters and other emergency workers, Tommy Moose plush dolls are presented to children in various traumatic situations. The external focus of our service is directed towards many worthwhile national charities, a few of which are: Salvation Army, Safe Surfin’ USA Foundation, Big Brothers-Big Sisters, and St. Jude.\nIn our local Lodges, you will find a wide array of activities to participate in both as an individual and as a family. From holiday parties, dances, sports, themed dinners and live entertainment, the Moose has much to offer.  Membership can mean different things to different people. You are the one determining what you want to get out of the organization, and what you want to give back.\nThe Moose is about celebrating life together, serving those in need within our local community, supporting our children at Mooseheart and standing by our senior members at Moosehaven.

For many of us, these gatherings are more than just picnics; they’re a time to share favorite memories, rekindle family bonds, and pass on that sense of belonging to our children and grandchildren. They remind us that even as life pulls us in different directions, there’s always a place where we’re connected, supported, and truly seen. It’s that feeling of coming home, of being part of something bigger than ourselves, that truly makes these reunions special.\nThis same spirit of connection and belonging is something we’ve been celebrating with immense pride within our Moose Fraternity. Just as families grow and welcome new members, so too has our Fraternity experienced a remarkable fourth year of membership growth. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the ever-expanding circle of individuals who are choosing to be part of our mission of community service, camaraderie, and support. Each new member brings fresh perspectives, new energy, and a renewed commitment to our shared values. They strengthen our collective ability to make a positive impact in our communities and to uphold the rich traditions of the Moose.\nThis growth is a testament to the welcoming atmosphere of our lodges, the dedication of our existing members, and the undeniable appeal of a community built on mutual respect and a desire to do good. It shows that in a world that can sometimes feel disconnected, people are actively seeking places where they can forge meaningful relationships, contribute to something larger than themselves, and find that invaluable sense of belonging. Just like a family reunion that expands with new spouses and generations, our Fraternity is thriving by embracing new members who share our vision. This ongoing growth is not just a cause for celebration, but a powerful motivator to continue our important work and extend the hand of friendship to even more individuals.\nIf you missed the International Convention in Milwaukee and time with your Moose family, don’t worry, we captured all the key sessions on video and have it posted to our YouTube Channel. In addition to the four straight years of membership growth, a historic announcement was made about expanding our mission at Mooseheart. Check out the Opening Session to see how our Moose family is about to grow. We had some key officers installed, including Moose International Board Chairman John Reiter, WOTM Grand Regent Dawn Gark and International Moose Legion President Helton Shaw. Finally, all four categories of proposed General Law changes passed and will take effect of Friday, August 1, 2025.\nAlright, all this celebrating has made me hungry. If you happen to be working the grill this summer, I love a good slice of cheddar cheese on my hamburger – let’s eat! God Bless!\nIf you have a concern or idea you’d like to share, use our online form: “\nTell the Chief Executive Officer\n.”\n.entry-content\nMoose Events/Meetings\nConventions & Conferences\nActivities\nMember Benefits\nForms & Documents\nThe Moose\nThe General Laws - Effective 8/1/25\nContacts & Committees\nChairman of the Board\nLodge Ritual\nRecognition Programs\nHall Rental Insurance\nImportant Dates & Deadlines\nMoose Legion & Higher Degrees\nMoose Legion Conference | Recap (Nov 2024)\nMoose Legion\nFellowship Degree\nPilgrim Degree\nCouncil of Higher Degrees\nMoose Ceremonies & Procedures\nStatistics\nMonthly Messages\nWomen of the Moose\nGeneral Laws - Effective 5/1/21\nOne Moose Reality Script\nContact & Committees\nOrientation & Special Meetings\nLCL Web & QuickBooks Online Tips\nWOW\nMonthly Messages\nRally Day Celebrations\nChapter Advocates\nMoose Programs/Activities\nFraternal Recognition Program\nMoose Rewards Program\nMoose Riders\nValued Veterans\nMember Information / Campaigns\nBe A Moose\nMoose Mobile App\nAnnual Membership Campaign\nMoose 25 Club\nShort-Term Campaigns\nMembership Information\nSponsors of Distinction\nConventions & Conferences\nNew Member Orientation Program\nCommunication Resources\nPublications/Bios/Photos/Videos/Website Updates\nMoose Magazine (August-September)\nMoose Magazine Archives\nBiographical Sheets & Profiles\nMoose Photos & Artwork\nLodge / Chapter Communication & Information\nMoose Video Link\nOfficial Communications\nMoose Leader\nMoose Training\nMoose Online Training\nMoose Training Forms & Documents\nMoose Training Demos & Tools Page\nQuickBooks Online Tutorials & Reference Materials\nTrainer Area\n#content\n#primary\nSET: FOOTER\nthe moose family\nMAIN\nHome\nAbout Us\nBe a Moose\nNews\nPay Dues\nFind a Lodge\nLCL Web\nPaperless Billing\nDiversity Statement\nMembers\nMembers Area\nMy Membership Record\nMoose News\nAll Forms & Documents\nEmployment Opportunities\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\nContact Us\nAddress Changes\nField Staff\nRESOURCES\nHelp Desk\nMy Membership Record\nContact Us\nCopyright.

Since the joining of James J Davis in 1906, the focus of the Moose has been on helping others. Throughout the years we not only have taken care of our children at Mooseheart and our seniors at Moosehaven, but we have also helped many others. The support of Special Olympics, Safe Surfin, the Tommy Moose Dolls, and many other programs makes us unique.\nDuring the opening night session, CEO Scott Hart and Mooseheart Director Gary Urwiler announced a new program. This program will allow us to bring in children and, in the future, adults with intellectual and physical disabilities into our care on the Mooseheart campus. This program will again make the Moose Fraternity unique as we go where no other fraternal organization has gone.\nLet’s strive to “Keep it alive and go for 5” in giving our fraternity five years of membership growth. With your help we can do it, as there is no better organization than the Moose Fraternity. Let us continue “Moving Forward and Giving Back” to our members and in our communities. Remember that the spirit of the Moose fraternity must be carried into our communities, our neighborhoods, and our homes, and to embody the values of the Moose fraternity in your everyday lives.\nDownload:\nChairman of the Board Bio\nDownload:\nChairman of the Board Travel Schedule\n.entry-content\n#content\n#primary\nSET: FOOTER\nthe moose family\nMAIN\nHome\nAbout Us\nBe a Moose\nNews\nPay Dues\nFind a Lodge\nLCL Web\nPaperless Billing\nDiversity Statement\nMembers\nMembers Area\nMy Membership Record\nMoose News\nAll Forms & Documents\nEmployment Opportunities\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\nContact Us\nAddress Changes\nField Staff\nRESOURCES\nHelp Desk\nMy Membership Record\nContact Us\nCopyright.

Our Council members run various social programs and do a fair amount of fund-raising as well. Support of Moose Charities initiatives and our fraternity in general is often very rewarding as done by these groups. After all, they are made up of past and current leaders who believe in our cause and know our needs and how to fulfill them.\nAdditionally, the Councils normally have an annual banquet and/or other events to honor those new degree holders who have advanced in the past year. These events recognize the individuals and offer a chance to publically thank them for their service among their peers. This in itself promotes benevolence and charity among all members.\nAs members of the Higher Degrees, these groups are generally in the forefront of support and promotion of Moose programs and lead the cause of fraternalism by example. These groups, at the Chapter, Lodge and Moose Legion level, may meet as often as desired to socialize, work towards building membership strength, raise funds for Moose Charities and help with various other fraternal endeavors.\nAny forms and additional information regarding Council of Higher Degrees can be found\nhere\n.\n.entry-content\n#content\n#primary\nSET: FOOTER\nthe moose family\nMAIN\nHome\nAbout Us\nBe a Moose\nNews\nPay Dues\nFind a Lodge\nLCL Web\nPaperless Billing\nDiversity Statement\nMembers\nMembers Area\nMy Membership Record\nMoose News\nAll Forms & Documents\nEmployment Opportunities\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\nContact Us\nAddress Changes\nField Staff\nRESOURCES\nHelp Desk\nMy Membership Record\nContact Us\nCopyright.
