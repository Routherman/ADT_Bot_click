Emerging Artists, who are determined through the same juried process as all of the event’s participating artists, will have the opportunity to make sales and get feedback from art patrons and judges. While Emerging Artists are not eligible for prizes, the exposure and the experience is invaluable. This year four artists were chosen for the program.\nSarah Luciano\nsarahgiselle98@gmail.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pausa_pottery/\nBooth Number: 211\nSarah Luciano was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Orlando. She began working with clay in 2016 at Valencia Community College and continued to earn her BFA at UCF in 2020. During those years, her body of work consisted of strictly working on the wheel with porcelain and mastering crystalline glaze. Sarah only began hand-building a couple years later when she began to test the limits of clay. From making ceramic cakes to now knots. The idea of making something look deceivingly solid or appear “malleable” with clay fascinates me, and it is something I will continue to expand on.\nStephanie Brown\nstephjbee@gmail.com\nhttps://stephaniejeanbrown.com\nBooth Number: 212\nStephanie grew up in California and relocated to Pennsylvania in 2021. Originally a watercolor painter who focused on florals and still life, she has recently found a more natural home for herself in soft pastel. She loves its versatility and immediacy and enjoys exploring its many possibilities as a medium. The change of medium also coincided with a more from California to Pennsylvania, which ignited a love for the landscape and a newfound enjoyment of painting plein air.\nIn September of 2023, Stephanie enrolled in Studio Incamminati’s Advanced Diploma of Fine Arts program. She has achieved Signature status with the Pastel Society of America, the Philadelphia Pastel Society, the Pastel Society of the West Coast, and the Maryland Pastel Society.  She is an Associate member of the American Impressionist Society.\nMatt Matsudaira\nmattmatsudaira@gmail.com\nhttps://mattmatsudairafineart.com/\nBooth Number: 210\nMatt Matsudaira, born in 1995, is a self-taught Japanese-American oil painter living in Orlando, Florida. He is passionate about recreating landscapes from impactful real-life moments, but also enjoys painting wildlife and architecture.\nBorn in Tokyo, Japan, Matt Matsudaira enjoyed a rich childhood filled with soccer, Legos, and drawing wildlife encyclopedia books. In 2006, he and his family moved to the United States. He continued to practice drawing, and in high school art class he was introduced to both charcoal and paint. Charcoal came naturally, but Matsudaira was so disappointed in his first painting that he vowed never to pick up a brush again.\n10 years later in 2021, Matt Matsudaira was so inspired by the vivid colors of Sedona, Arizona, where he and his wife were married, that he decided to give paint another chance. There was no turning back. Since then, he has created countless paintings and honed his own style that combines the detail of drawing with the depth of color that harkens back to his first inspiration to capture the dramatic beauty of Sedona.\nWill Shotwell\nwillshotwellphoto@gmail.com\nhttps://willshotwellphotography.com\nBooth Number: 209\nWill, the creative mind behind Will Shotwell Photography, has always had\na passion for creating. From leather working to designing and creating\njewelry, he has a knack for transforming ideas into tangible art.\nPhotography has been part of Will’s life since an early age—his\nparents were professional photographers with their own studio, and their\ninfluence inspired his own love for the craft. In high school, Will\ndiscovered his own passion for capturing moments through the lens. While\nstudying at Embry-Riddle after high school, Will realized that\nphotography was his true calling. He decided to turn his passion into a\ncareer and has never looked back.\nBy day, Will works for a medical equipment sales Company where he specializes in photographing and selling used and/or refurbished medical equipment. In his spare time, he channels his creativity into Will Shotwell Photography, capturing moments and memories that reflect his unique artistic vision.  When he’s\nnot behind the camera, Will enjoys spending time with his fiancée,\nSusan, and his two stepsons. He also continues to channel his creativity\ninto making jewelry and working with leather. Will’s family and artistic pursuits are at the heart of everything he does, bringing a personal touch to every photo he takes.",

We are committed to providing a safe space where artists can showcase and sell their original works. We are committed to striking the right balance between enabling our artists to leverage new creative tools and technologies while ensuring that The Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival remains a marketplace known for its original artworks created by real artists. To maintain the integrity and authenticity of the art displayed at our event, we have established the following policies regarding the use of AI in creating artwork:\nOriginality Requirement: All artwork must be original and created by the artist. While we allow the use of AI tools during the preliminary stages of creation, the final artwork output must be the artist’s work and not solely generated by AI.\nAI Tool Usage: Artists may use AI tools to assist with brainstorming, generating ideas, or creating initial drafts. However, the final piece should be significantly transformed and developed beyond what the AI produced. This transformation should reflect the artist’s individual creativity, style, and effort.\nDisclosure: If AI tools were used at any stage of the creation process, artists must disclose this information in the description of their artwork. Transparency about the use of AI helps maintain trust and integrity within our community.\nProhibited Content: Uploading artwork that is entirely generated by AI without significant human modification is PROHIBITED.\nRespect for Copyrights: Artists must ensure that any AI tools used do not infringe on existing copyrights or intellectual property rights. The use of AI-generated content that replicates or closely mimics existing works is not allowed.\nReview Process: Our team reserves the right to review and assess the originality of artwork. If an artwork is found to violate our AI policy, it may be removed from the artist’s exhibit.\nIMPORTANT\nDuring The 67th Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival all displays will be visited by the Viewing Committee to ensure that the displays and artwork are in compliance with Festival rules. It is our exclusive right and responsibility to remove work that is not in compliance.  An Officer of the Festival will make the final decision.  Non-compliance can result in expulsion and ineligibility for judging, awards and future Festival participation.\nLOAD-IN & SETUP INFORMATION\nDetailed setup and load-in information (including the load-in route, parking and check-in locations, and reservation times) will be shared in advance of the Festival. Please note that artists with booths in the park will set up on Thursday, March 19, 2026.\nOTHER\nIf you need assistance before, during, or after the Festival (i.e., unloading, set-up, take-down, etc.) due to a disability, please let us know and we will be happy to make arrangements to help you.\nSTATE TAX\nEach artist is responsible for collecting and reporting Florida Sales Tax on all sales made during the festival. The current tax rate for the State of Florida/Orange County is six and one-half percent (\n6.5%\n). Reporting forms will be provided by Florida Department of Revenue at check-in or may be obtained at\nhttp://dor.myflorida.com/Pages/forms_index.aspx\n.\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nThe Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival is committed to nurturing and maintaining a positive and inclusive environment where exhibitors, visitors, patrons, suppliers, sponsors, board members and volunteers can all engage respectfully and professionally. To ensure a safe and successful festival we ask that all participants adhere to the following principles:\nConduct yourself with professionalism in all interactions.\nTreat everyone with courtesy and respect.\nFollow all applicable safety procedures, application rules, and local laws at all times.\nBe considerate of the diverse backgrounds, experiences and beliefs of others.\nReport any uncomfortable, unsafe or unacceptable behavior to a member of The Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival staff.\nUnacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:\nHarassment, bullying, or discrimination of any kind – whether verbal, physical, or visual.\nBeing under the excessive influence of alcohol or other substances.\nEngaging in any illegal activity.\nFailing to follow safety procedures, festival policies as outlined in the application, local laws, or instructions from a member of the festival staff.\nThe Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival is committed to addressing any concerns swiftly and appropriately.
