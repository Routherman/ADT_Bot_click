The Grants Office, in coordination with City Departments, obtains federal, state, local and foundation grant funds that support the City’s Strategic Plan.  The City of Miami Beach has a centralized grant process, which ensures a higher standard of coordination between City Departments, and approval at the City Manager and Commission level.  The Grants Office provides leadership and direction throughout the lifecycle of the grant funded project, from identification of funds and application to the funding agency, to closeout and project completion.\nThe Office ensures compliance with federal and state guidelines and regulations and monitors functions such as financial, budgeting, program implementation, performance and reporting administration. Grants Management staff serve as liaisons between funding agencies and City departments.  Grants are obtained for many City uses, including capital construction, general operating funds, program/project funding, technical assistance and planning activities. The Grants Management Division also assists with the distribution of Citywide grant funds to community-based organizations, and it assists with strategic planning of the City’s Legislative process and the annual Budget process.\nSome examples of City projects/programs with grant funding are:\nMiddle Beach Beachwalk\nMaurice Gibb Park\nBrittany Bay Park\nNorth Shore Youth Center Wind Mitigation\nMiami Beach Soccer Club\nBeach Dune Habitat Restoration\nSouth Beach Trolley Service\nAnnual Grant Awards\nrelated resources\nCommunity Development Block Grants for Mitigation\n← Operating Budget Resolutions\nAnnual Grant Awards →\n.entry-content .clear\n#post-##\n.entry-header\nGrants Management\nHome\n>\nCity Hall\n>\nFinance\n>\nGrants Management\nThe Grants Management Division maximizes the amount of funding that the City of Miami Beach receives by actively seeking and applying for grants and funding opportunities.
