It’s when former residents return to reconnect with friends, family and neighbors. It is chance to celebrate the area’s Bahamian roots that date back to the 1800s and to be a part of a cultural tradition that began in 1977. It is three days of family-friendly fun filled with great food and music and energizing Junkanoo rushes. Below is a selection of photos that capture the joy this annual event brings to Little Bahamas of Coconut Grove.\n(L) Goombay Queen, Traci Young-Byron at Armbrister Park on the opening night of the Goombay Festival, Coconut Grove, Florida, 2024.
