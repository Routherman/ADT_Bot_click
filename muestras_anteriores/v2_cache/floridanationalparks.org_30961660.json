Born in Montreal, Paul grew up near the sea in Hingham, MA. After graduating from The Art Institute of Boston in 1973, he spent 6 months as a deckhand on a research vessel which eventually brought him to Florida.\nHe arrived in Naples in 1974, and since then, has called Naples his home. It also serves as his base for extensive painting junkets to the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia, the South Pacific, Indonesia, Australia, Hawaii, the Middle East, and Europe.\nAlong with travel, annual fundraising shows have been a hallmark of his career and as of 1983,  have benefited a variety of non-profit organizations devoted to health, environmental protection, and historic preservation. His lifelong pursuit to capture the essence of a location, particularly coastal communities, is enhanced by his passion for history and his natural storytelling ability.\nPaul’s paintings are available for viewing at his studio in Old Naples. For appointments call 239-263-1214 or by email paul@paularsenault.art.com\nGulfshore Life Magazine is Wine & Wildlife’s exclusive magazine sponsor.

      "text": "June 14, 2024\nExciting News: Grant Award from Arthrex Charitable Giving Supports SWAMP Program!\nWe are thrilled to announce that The Alliance for Florida’s National Parks has received a generous $5,000 grant from Arthrex Charitable Giving to support the Swamp Water And Me Program (SWAMP) at Big Cypress National Preserve. This funding will enable us to continue offering this impactful program, which provides every 6th-grade student in Collier County the opportunity to explore and experience the natural wonders of Big Cypress for a day.\nAbout the SWAMP Program\nThe SWAMP program is a curriculum-based enrichment activity designed to introduce students to the unique ecosystems of Big Cypress National Preserve. The program begins in the classroom with a visiting ranger who prepares the students for their field trip. On the day of the trip, students travel by bus to the preserve where they engage in hands-on, interdisciplinary activities that foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world.\nWhile in the swamp, students explore three distinct habitats—cypress swamp, open prairie, and pineland. They use radio-telemetry equipment to track a Florida panther (represented by a beanie baby), conduct water quality tests, take soil samples, record weather conditions, and identify local flora and fauna. This immersive experience transforms students into scientists for the day, enhancing their observation and analytical skills.\nImpact of the SWAMP Program\nThe SWAMP program aims to provide students with hands-on, curriculum-based field experiences that help them understand their connections and responsibilities to the environment. The program’s goals include:\nOffering interdisciplinary learning that leads to lifelong environmental stewardship.\nInstilling a new environmental ethic in students through inquiry-based learning.\nDemonstrating the positive effects of nature exposure on children’s physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development, including stress reduction and improved attention spans.\nWith a 19-year reputation for success, the SWAMP program has been a leader in environmental education in the region. It has consistently demonstrated significant learning gains and has great potential for long-term positive outcomes.\nAbout Arthrex\nArthrex is a global medical device company and leader in new product development and medical education in orthopedics. Headquartered in Naples, Florida, Arthrex is committed to improving patient outcomes and advancing minimally invasive surgical techniques. Their charitable giving program focuses on supporting education, community development, and environmental sustainability initiatives.\nThank You, Arthrex!\nWe are deeply grateful to Arthrex Charitable Giving for their generous support of the SWAMP program. Their contribution will ensure that thousands of 6th-grade students in Collier County can continue to benefit from this transformative educational experience. Together, we are fostering a new generation of informed citizens, community leaders, and environmental stewards dedicated to preserving the fragile and unique ecosystems of South Florida.\nFor more information about Arthrex and their commitment to community and environmental sustainability, please visit Arthrex.",
