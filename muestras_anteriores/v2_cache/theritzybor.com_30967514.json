Over the decades, it has transformed from a silent movie theatre to a playhouse, nightclub, and now a premier concert venue. In 2008, it officially reopened as the RITZ Ybor, showcasing its rich history and modern features.\nSituated in the heart of the historic Ybor City district, the RITZ Ybor is just a short trolley ride away from the Water Street district, within 2-3 miles from downtown Tampa, and is only a 15-minute car ride from the Tampa International Airport.\nSince its reopening in 2008, the RITZ Ybor has hosted high-profile events such as Super Bowl parties, national product launch parties, and sold-out concerts from acclaimed artists like Lady Gaga, Imagine Dragons, Kendrick Lamar, Skrillex, and more.\nSunset Events has made the RITZ Ybor its home since 2016, further cementing the venue’s status as a leading destination for unforgettable live music and special events in Tampa.\nThe RITZ Ybor is located at 1503 East 7th Avenue in Tampa, FL.\nABOUT SUNSET EVENTS\nFor over 2 decades, Sunset Events has dominated the dance music industry with top events, festivals, and promotions in Tampa Bay and Central Florida. Owner John Santoro started this endeavor back in 1995, and Sunset Events has produced over 150 events each year along with its annual music festival,\nSunset Music Festival\n.\nSunset Events has featured hundreds of world-class artists: Tiësto, Deadmau5, Skrillex, Illenium, Excision, The Chainsmokers, Zedd, Above & Beyond, RL Grime, NF, 21 Savage, Porter Robinson, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, Paul van Dyk, Armin Van Buuren, Paul Oakenfold, Benny Benassi, Carnage, 6lack, Juice Wrld, Oliver Heldens, Adventure Club, Dillon Francis, Borgore, Zeds Dead, Malaa, Slander, NGHTMRE, Pauly D, Flosstradamus just to name a few.\nFor more info about Sunset Events, please visit:\nsunsettampa.com\n.\nVENUE POLICIES\nGeneral Admission:\nWe are a STANDING ROOM venue.
