Located at\n2075 Periwinkle Way (#14)\nin Periwinkle Place, we’re your go-to spot for island-inspired American cuisine across all dayparts—breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night bites, and special events.\nOur Story\nStarted by local islanders who wanted to bring fresh, flavorful, and fun dining to Sanibel, Blue Giraffe quickly became known for turning ordinary BLTs, burgers, and tacos into uniquely delicious creations that stand out\n.\nWhen Hurricane Ian hit in 2022, we rose to the challenge. We pivoted to a food-truck model, helping pave the way for island food-truck permitting. In March 2025, we triumphantely reopened our brick-and-mortar location—this time bigger and better. Under new ownership by Michael Puente, with mentorship from founder Bill Letendre, we rebuilt from the ground up, added an adjacent storefront, and introduced an inviting modern space featuring a local artist’s giraffe mural, blue epoxy flooring, and artful nods to our original style\nWhat We Offer\nAll‑Day Menu\n: Classic island‑inspired dishes for every meal—breakfast omelettes, fresh salads, creative burgers, seafood tacos, and more.\nFull Bar & Happy Hour\n: Sip specialty cocktails, wine, or cold beer daily. Enjoy Happy Hour from 4–6 pm at Periwinkle Place.\nLate‑Night Bites & Events\n: Stay tuned—late-night dining and special events are in the works.\nPet‑Friendly Patio:\nBring your furry friends—our patio is pet-friendly and perfect for island chill times.\nWhat Our Guests Say\n“Fantastic food, arguably the best on the island… Not just another BLT or mahi taco, it’s their own. Their ingredients are fresh and you can tell the difference.”\n– Ryan Goodmanson\n“Split a burger… bun was fresh and hamburger melted in mouth… service was also excellent.”\n– Chuck P\n“Best place on the island… great food and the service is excellent!!!!!”\n– Pandora Figley\nSomething Exciting\nIs Happening!
