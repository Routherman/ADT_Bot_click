The rural vernacular architecture and cultural landscape help tell the story of the evolution of Florida farming.\nThe farm was established by Phillip Benjamin Harvey Dudley Sr. before the Civil War. His son, P.B.H. Dudley Jr., developed the farmstead you see today. Eighteen original buildings built between the 1880s and 1930s still exist, including the restored family farmhouse with original furnishings, kitchen, general store, post office and cane syrup complex. Staff and volunteers in period farm clothing perform chores, raise crops and tend to livestock - cracker cows and horses, bronze turkeys and heritage breed chickens.\nStroll the nature trail or enjoy a rocking chair on the spacious porches once used as gathering places. Pack a picnic and watch deer, wild turkeys, gopher tortoises and bluebirds in the fields. Join us at the Annual Cane Festival or a Dudley Kids event. Learn more at the visitor center featuring a 12-minute video, interpretive exhibits and a self-guided cellphone tour. Take a walk into the past and immerse yourself in history.\nDudley Farm Historic State Park in Newberry was designated as a\nNational Historic Landmark\non Jan. 13, 2021. The farm received this designation for its exceptional ability to illustrate the history of owner-operator farms in the southern U.S. in the late 19th and 20th centuries. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the park on Dec. 4, 2021.\nPets are allowed in the visitor center area only, not in the historic farmstead.\nPlan Your Visit\nLearn\nManager's Message\nIf you would like to experience the way life was in Florida 100 to 150 years ago, then stop by Dudley Farm and get that experience first-hand.\nLearn\nStop and Smell the Flowers\nAs you enter the gates, the garden welcomes you. Your senses are surrounded by sights, scents and sounds.\nLearn\nA Day in the Life on the Farm\nFirewood needs to be chopped, clothes need to be washed and dinner needs to be prepared. Chores were a part of daily life on Dudley Farm, and still are today.

Most common injuries result from boat strikes.\nThe state park also participates in the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s Manatee Rescue, Rehabilitation and Release Program. The park cares for injured or ill manatees until they can safely be released back into the wild.\nMore information available from the\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\nProgram Registration\nRegistration is not required.\nProgram Cost\nFree with park admission and includes a 15 to 20 minute talk followed by a feeding of the park’s captive manatees.\nTimes\nOffered three times daily:\n11:30 a.m.\n1:30 p.m.\n3:30 p.m.\nLocation\nApril 1 - November 14\nUnderwater Observatory\nNovember 15 - March 31\nManatee Care Facility\nParticipating Parks\nEllie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park\nManatee Educational Program\nProgram Registration\nRegistration is not required.\nProgram Cost\nFree with park admission and includes a 15 to 20 minute talk followed by a feeding of the park’s captive manatees.\nTimes\nOffered three times daily:\n11:30 a.m.\n1:30 p.m.\n3:30 p.m.\nLocation\nApril 1 - November 14\nUnderwater Observatory\nNovember 15 - March 31\nManatee Care Facility\nParticipating Parks\nEllie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park\nHave Questions?\nContact the Statewide Information Line:\n(850) 245-2157\nOr send an email to:\nFSP.Feedback@FloridaDEP.gov\nStay Connected\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nPinterest\nYou Tube",
