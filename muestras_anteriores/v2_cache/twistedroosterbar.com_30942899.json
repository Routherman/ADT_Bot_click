Just be kind!\nHave fun! We'd love for you to come back again and again!\nAbout Us\nOur Twisted Story\nJimit Kapadia, our Founder, wanted to bring a unique experience to Melbourne, Florida. In October 2018, Jimit started planning and organizing a small team of trusted individuals to help him pull together his vision. The Twisted Rooster was born and proudly opened it's doors in December 2018.\nHis vision for the bar included: offering a warm and sincere welcome to guests, being able to anticipate each guest’s needs continually throughout their time  at Twisted Rooster, and to provide great service and a fantastic time, and always encourage their return.\nTwisted Rooster's leadership team includes:\nRebecca Julian\nJoseph Julian\nMark Popp A.K.A. CoCo Biatche\nBrandon Milam\nAt Twisted Rooster we seek to create an atmosphere that combines the energy, excitement, entertainment, fun, and sophistication of our locations with genuine care and concern for our guests.\nAt Twisted Rooster we are throwing a party—it's going to be a very hip and fun party with lots of people coming and going. We want to be the place that people choose to visit time and time again. As with a great party, we want people to rave about all the “little details”, and upon leaving feel like they have to tell all of their friends about us.\nOur best advertising is a guest bragging about their terrific experience to anyone and everyone.\nBar Staff\nTwisted People to Keep Twisted Customers Happy\nMark\nDirector of Events\nLinda\nMadison\nChristian\nErin\njim\nDylan\nJustin\nKate\nAlex\nJennifer\nKeith\nTonya\nStephen James",
