The festival seeks to use the power of film to entertain, educate and challenge conventional perspectives on complex issues facing the Jewish people and global community alike.\nThe TBJFF is a celebration of the finest international films that focus on Jewish themes and is one of the most inclusive and pluralistic Jewish events in the greater Tampa Bay area. The festival delivers an extraordinary collection of gripping dramas, thought-provoking documentaries, eclectic shorts and offbeat comedies depicting Jewish life from different times and places and appealing to everyone from the most discerning film critics to family audiences. Selected screenings are enhanced by providing a dynamic forum for audience dialogue with distinguished actors, producers, writers and other expert panelists.\nFounded in 1995, the festival has quickly grown in size and reputation, welcoming moviegoers from across the greater Tampa Bay area. The outstanding films are shown in venues in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater and attract moviegoers from every social and economic background from Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties and beyond. As attendance increases from year to year, the festival attracts not only a larger audience but also a more diverse one, reaching an increasingly multi-cultural and multi-generational (and especially younger) demographic.\nThe Tampa Bay Jewish Film Festival is produced by the Tampa Jewish Community Centers & Federation and the Jewish Federation of Pinellas & Pasco Counties. We hope you will find our web site informative and interactive. See you at the movies!\nJUDGES\n29th  Annual | 2025\nOur dedicated judges and volunteers are the backbone of the Tampa Bay Jewish Film Festival. Only through their hard work and commitment can we bring you, year after year, an exceptional Jewish Film Festival movie going experience.
