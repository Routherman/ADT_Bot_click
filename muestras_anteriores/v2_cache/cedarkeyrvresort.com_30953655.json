      "text": "About the Area\nThe island village of Cedar Key off the west-central coast of Florida is joined by a causeway and three bridges across four miles of shallow salt marsh. Home to clammers and fishermen, its picturesque charm draws artists, tourists, writers, showbirds and nature lovers. It is Florida's second oldest settlement and the end point of naturalist John Muir's thousand mile walk to the Gulf.\nCedar Key is one of the oldest ports in the state, and when Florida's first railroad connected it to the east coast, it became a major supplier of seafod and timber products to the northeast.\nCedar Key, which still looks like a frontier town in places, has developed a reputation for its artisan shops and seafood restaurants along Dock Street. Commercial fishermen farm clams, which have become a culinary icon.\nPlease also see the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce Web Site\nExcerpts From\nIslands\nMagazine - August 2007\nFrom the 20 Best Islands to Live On - Cedar Key, Florida, USA . . . Just a short bridge drive from the mainland . . . actually stretches out over six islands . . . a cute downtown, plenty of nature minded residents and some of the state's last affordable real estate . . .
