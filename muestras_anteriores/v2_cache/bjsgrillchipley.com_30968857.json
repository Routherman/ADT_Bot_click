In 2018, Brandon and Jennifer had the opportunity relocate from their home state oF Tennessee to Chipley, Florida. Within a matter of month they had found the perfect home and the perfect place to open BJ's Grill.  Since opening in 2018 we have continued to thrive. Our daughters, Lillie and Audrey enjoy being active in our community and school.  We now have a mini farm just outside of town and enjoy our downtime tending to our goats, chickens, cats, dog and calf.\nWe hope you enjoy your experience here at BJ's Grill and we look forward  to continuing to serve the Chipley and surrounding areas with great food, service, laughter and LOVE!\nBreakfast Time\nCome hungry when you join us for breakfast.  Our menu is A La Carte.  Which means you only order what you want! Everything is cooked to order when you eat at BJ's Grill.\nFresh Ingredients\nCasual shouldn't mean stale food options. Great taste is the name of the game, and we're committed to stepping up to the plate. We are dedicated to providing fresh options for our customers. Our burgers are hand patted and cooked to order when you order them! Then build your burger exactly the way you want it!\nStay Awhile or Grab & Run\nHave time to sit in?
