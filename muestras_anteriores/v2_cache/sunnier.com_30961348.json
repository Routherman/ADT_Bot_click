Volunteering is very important.\nYour Sponsors will guide you through the application process. Once your application to be a Sunnier member is approved at a Management meeting, you will be on probation for one year. At the end of that year, you must apply for General Membership.\nAll classes of members enjoy free 24 hours, 7 days per week use of the Park's recreational areas and member rates for camping and RV hook-ups as set by the board.  Also included is a reduced rate for the storage lot.\nWeb document may not be the most current.  Please consult with the office.\n8800 Okeechobee Road, Fort Pierce Florida 34945\nCopyright 2025, Sunnier Palms Nudist Park and Campground",
