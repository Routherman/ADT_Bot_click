Many boat brands are represented at the show, including the latest models of motor yachts, cruisers, center consoles, speedboats, sport fishing boats, and pontoons ranging in size from 12 feet to over 90 feet in length. Additional exhibits include the latest in personal watercraft, marine electronics, outboard and inboard engines, safety equipment, accessories, boat lifts, fishing gear, nautical clothing and jewelry, as well as financing and insurance companies.  Plenty of music, delicious food and drinks add to the festivities.\nPartial proceeds from The Stuart Boat Show benefit The Marine Industries Association of the Treasure Coast.
