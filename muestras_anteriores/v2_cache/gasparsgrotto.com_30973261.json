We are ambassadors to drinking alcoholic beverages, eating world class food, music, camaraderie, fellowship and fun.\nGaspar’s Grotto is also a beloved local landmark deep in the fiber of our community. We have used the venue over the past 20 plus years to raise more than ½ million dollars for local charities. Today, the guests may choose to ring the gargantuan, “World’s Largest Tip Bell” for a small contribution.\n100% of these contributions go directly to the Southeastern Guide Dogs. Southeastern Guide Dogs transforms lives by creating and nurturing extraordinary partnerships between people and dogs. They breed, raise, and train elite guide dogs, service dogs, and skilled companion dogs and provide life-changing services for people with vision loss, veterans with disabilities, and children with significant challenges. The organization offers premier dogs and lifetime follow-up services at no cost. Since 1982, they have successfully created thousands of guide and service dog teams throughout the U.S. and currently oversee the well-being of over 1,200 puppies and dogs.\nWe are committed to providing a memorable experience to our guests by providing quality in drink, food and service. We strive to build a lifelong memory of a unique and fun experience to every guest.\nAlthough we are near the center of local cocktail culture, ownership is decidedly retro. Our signature offering over the last 20 plus years is the $3 shot and a beer. We sell thousands every week. We cater to the drinking men and women because… that’s just what we do.\nIs there any place else, anywhere, where a couple can be married in a complete ceremony, by a genuine Sea Captain, for the princely sum of only $6.99?\nWe welcome any and all people of fellowship and kind heart to enjoy the ambiance of a genuinely unique and hospitable establishment.\nThe Owners, Captain Ehab the retired sea captain and his bride of many decades, the Head Bar Wench, have traveled to all points of the compass and most countries on the globe, civilized or not.\nAs a result, Gaspar’s Grotto is filled with nautical and other artifacts and artworks collected during their travels.\nMany guests comment that they feel like they are in a museum (albeit a raucus one!). And indeed the collection is of museum quality. Every artifact has a story that Captain Ehab is always ready to share. This includes photographs of relations, and friends of relations, who proudly served the country in the Armed Forces in bygone wars. We honor their sacrifices.\nAdditionally, The Captain and head bar wench have assembled a large collection of ship’s bells from around the world. These bells must be heard as they are rung daily and upon request. Their sweet music is often heard far down 7th Avenue here in Ybor city. One was even the property of Thomas Edison.\nAlso notable is the famous “World’s Largest Tip Bell.” This 19th century iron behemoth, weighing nearly ½ a ton, is suspended behind the bar where it is rung by the guests for a small donation to Southeastern Guide Dogs.\nCome be amazed at what the fruits of a lifetime of world travels, and careful collecting, have brought to the World Famous Gaspar’s Grotto.\nGASPAR’S GROTTO\n1805 E 7th Ave\nTampa, FL 33605\n(813) 248-5900\nClick here to find out why we're among Tampa's top restaurants.\nHOURS\nMonday – Saturday: 7am – 2am\nSunday: 11am – 2am\nMenu\nCatering\nVIP Bottle Lounge\nPig Roast\nEvents\nGet Married\nAbout Us\nEmployment\nContact\nShop Ybor Gift Company\nGASPAR’S GROTTO GIFT CARDS\nGiving the gift of the Gaspar’s Grotto experience just got easier.
