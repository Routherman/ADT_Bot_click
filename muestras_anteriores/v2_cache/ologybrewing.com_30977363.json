Growing up surrounded by science and experimentation, Nick Walker, Head Brewer, developed a keen interest in the world of sensory research, particularly in taste and smell. This fascination, combined with his love for creating food in the kitchen, sparked his venture into homebrewing, where he discovered his true passion for crafting exceptional beverages.In collaboration with his longtime friends, Paul Woodward and Brian Clark, Ology took its first steps in June 2017. Their shared enthusiasm for crafting fine liquors, coffee, and a diverse range of beers, from Hazy IPAs to BA stouts, lagers, fruited sours, and unique rums, laid the foundation for what Ology is today.\nCompany\nAbout\nContact\nTaprooms\n[Midtown]\n[Northside]\n[Power Mill]\n[Tampa]\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nName\n*\nFirst\nLast\nName Email\nEmail\n*\n.wpforms-field-container\nSubmit\n.wpforms-container\nCompany\nAbout\nContact\nTaprooms\n[Midtown]\n[Northside]\n[Power Mill]\n[Tampa]\nLogin\n©2025 - All Rights Reserved\n2708 Power Mill Ct, Tallahassee, FL 32301\nOLOGY NEWSLETTER\nSign up for exclusive discounts and more!\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nName\n*\nFirst\nLast\nName Email\nEmail\n*\n.wpforms-field-container\nSubmit\n.wpforms-container",

With this inspiration in mind, we work tirelessly to pursue our passion of merging traditional and new techniques and flavor profiles to craft incredible beer, liquor, coffee and food.\nOlogy Brewing Co. was created out of, well… genetics. Yeah, that doesn’t sound very romantic, but the reality is true. Head Brewer and Founder of Ology, Nick Walker, was raised in a family of researchers and scientists who found their home in Tallahassee, FL at Florida State University in the 1950’s.\nAnd if you didn’t think science was cool already, Nick’s father, Jim Walker, also studied olfaction — the study of smell. His research looked into how smell affects us psychologically.\nThen, enter Nick Walker, who graduated with a B.S. in biology and worked as a nurse at a local hospital. He’s loved beer since before he could walk, and uses his incessant thirst for knowledge to study beer history and travel to learn from the most notable craft brewers.\nWe pursue what's\ndifferent, undiscovered and unequaled.\nYou could say that Ology’s history really started with Nick’s grandfather, Lloyd Beidler, a prominent researcher at Florida State University’s psychobiology department, who forged discoveries into the science of how we experience taste. During his years, Beidler conducted experiments and made incredible discoveries, including the effects of Miracle Fruit, which, if ingested before eating something sour, would make the flavor in your mouth taste sweet.\nFollow Us\nNever Miss What's Happening\nStay connected with Ology Brewing Co by following us on social media!
