Brian is a dedicated and passionate professional who specializes in non-profit leadership, zoological management, conservation, and education. After being an animal care specialist at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Disney's Animal Kingdom for 11 years, Brian joined Lubee in 2007 as Curator and became Director in 2011. During this time the organization has significantly expanded local and global conservation/education efforts, fundraising, marketing, capital improvements, native bat projects, and bat welfare and enrichment programs. Brian led Lubee to its 5th consecutive AZA accreditation in 2020 and ensures that the organization is consistently compliant with all federal, state, and local requirements. Brian has nearly 30 years of bat experience with numerous published articles on animal husbandry, enrichment, and medical management. He is extremely passionate about his role in the zoological/conservation field and is working to further Lubee’s status as a global leader in bat welfare, conservation, and education.\nTRACY POPE\nOperations & Programs Manager\nYou guano know something about Tracy? She LOVES bats and a great pun!  She is from Pittsburgh, PA and has an AS in Zoo Animal Technology from Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo. Prior to joining the Lubee team in 2015, Tracy acquired 11 years of animal care experience in the veterinary field and 5 years at Disney's Animal Kingdom as an Animal Food Specialist. Tracy is a creative person with a mind for details and enjoys putting her passions towards Lubee's conservation and education endeavors. Since her start, Tracy has lead Lubee through multiple successful events. Don't let her title fool you. She wears many hats🎩👒here at Lubee and makes everyone of them look marvelous.  😉\nFrom managing all of Lubee's Programs, to creating graphics for all avenues of Lubee, to caring for our microbats, to scheduling your tours, or filling online orders, Tracy has her finger on the pulse of what makes Lubee run smoothly. She hopes that you'll come visit or attend one of Lubee's many events! Come for the tour, stay to explore!\nAnd that's a-bat it. 😁🦇💕\n​\nANNALYSE WILLIAMS\nAnimal Care Manager\nAnnalyse is from Middleburg, FL and has a Bachelor of Science in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation from the University of Florida, with a minor in Business Administration. While in school at UF she joined Lubee as a volunteer in June of 2017 and in September of 2017 she joined the team as a Call-In Keeper. Annalyse's experience also includes working with rhinos and other large hoof stock at White Oak Conservation in Yulee, FL as a Wildlife Conservation Intern in 2018. She joined the Lubee team full-time in March of 2020 as a keeper and the records coordinator. Since then she has risen to her current position of Animal Care Manager which she has held since October of 2021.\nAnnalyse is also the winner of the Tim Myrick Award of Excellence for 2022 & 2023!\nBRITTANY PERRY\nSenior Animal Care / Records Coordinator\nBrittany grew up in Peachtree City, Georgia and followed a winding path that led to Zookeeping. She graduated from Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo with an AS in Zoo Animal Technology. Though Brittany has always wanted to work with animals, she didn't know exactly how. Zookeeping was a turning point for her and extremely eye opening, proving that there are many paths to working with animals. It also drove home how important conservation, education, and awareness is to animals, people, and the habitats that we all share. She is ecstatic to have found a place to not only share the first-hand experience of caring for these incredibly important species, but also to know that she is lending a hand to their wild counterparts. As the Records Coordinator she makes sure that all our 200+ bats information is getting stored properly to assist in providing quality animal welfare. When you visit you might just find Brittany with her nose buried in animal records, or happily working alongside her co-workers to enrich the lives of these magnificent creatures.\nAnna Archer\nAnimal Care / Intern & Volunteer Coordinator\nAnna is from Jupiter, FL and is a graduate from the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo where she received her AS in Zoo Animal Technology. She has always wanted to work with animals and found her calling in the zoo field. Anna started interning at Lubee after graduating from SFCTZ, and became a member of the team shortly then after. She has great empathy towards others, human and non-human, and is very grateful to be involved in bat conservation as part of a wonderful team. Come join Anna, and the Lubee team as a Intern or Volunteer. She's ready to lead you on a wild adventure of animal care and more!\nPaige Kidwell\nAnimal Care / Social Media Coordinator\nPaige is from Indiana, where she received her BS in Wildlife from Purdue University. She discovered her passion for bats while learning wildlife research techniques in college, and went on to assist with bat research projects in South Carolina and Georgia after graduating. While she loved the research side of her profession, she found that she was even more passionate about sharing that information with people. She has helped connect people to a variety of animals at nature centers, zoos, and schools around the US, but it has always been Paige’s dream to connect people with her favorite animal, bats! We are really excited to have Paige as a part of the Lubee Bat Conservancy team! Be sure to check out Lubee's social media platforms to discover Paige's passion for bats!\nHannah Rollins\nAnimal Care / Education Coordinator\nHannah is from Gainesville, FL and graduated with a B.S in Biology with a focus on Zoology from the University of Central Florida. She has always been passionate about animal welfare and husbandry and knew she wanted to work with animals growing up.

They live on nearly every corner of the globe and occupy several food niches. The diversity of bat species is amazing.\nThe image below is a collage of images by Bryan Bongey using photos by Merlin Tuttle's Bat Conservation.\nWhat Are Bats\n?\nBats are in the mammal order Chiroptera which is Latin for 'hand wing'. Just like all mammals, bats are warm-blooded, have fur, give birth to live young and nurse their babies (also known as pups). Although they are in their own order\n,\nit is fascinating to see which animals bats are more closely related to. Often labeled as flying mice or rats, bats are actually closer to carnivores, antelopes, rhinos, and pangolins.  Check out this\ngreat, easy to read list\nfrom the University of TX El Paso and this\nevolutionary tree of mammals\n(look for Chiroptera on the right). Very interesting to see where humans and primates are on the list.\nImportance\nBats are one of the world's most important mammals. They are essential to ecosystem health, rainforests, and global economies. Humans need bats for insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal.\n​\nWithout bats the world would be a lot less interesting. Aside from losing an abundance of amazing biodiversity, our crops would suffer and insects would be overwhelming. Did you know that bats are the primary predator of night flying insects? That’s right, bats love insects, many that humans despise such as mosquitoes, stink bugs, and devastating agricultural pests such as the Corn earworm moth that causes billions of dollars in damage to cotton, soybeans and tomatoes. A single bat can eat hundreds of insects each night. Factor in a colony of thousands, or even millions, and that’s a lot of insects. A USGS study conducted in 2011 found that ‘Insect-eating bats provide pest-control services that save the U.S. agricultural industry over $3 billion per year.’ Read more about this study\nhere\n.\n​\nFruit and nectar bats spread seeds, pollinate flowers, and help regenerate forests. These bats swallow large amounts of small seeds while consuming fruits which are passed out over clear-cut areas resulting in reforestation. In some tropical areas of the world over 90% of the regrowth of the rainforest is due to bat dispersed seeds. Numerous agricultural products depend on bats for seed dispersal or pollin\nation such as banana, mango, avocado, cloves, coconut, figs, cashews, and agave (tequila). Fruit bats are capable of flying long distances which help maintain forest diversity and\nregeneration. ​Flying foxes are particularly important in oceanic islands where they\nare often the only animals big enough to transport larger seeds. Think of a mango\npit, bats are the only animal\ncapable of dispersing something of that size. An\nestimated 186 plant products used by humans rely upon fruit bats for\npollination and seed dispersal.\nAs fruit bat populations continue\nto decline, agriculture and the\neconomies of tropical countries suffers.\n​\nWANT MORE BAT INFO?
