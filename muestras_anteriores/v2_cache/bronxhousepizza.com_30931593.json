      "text": "About\nBronx House Pizza is an obsessively authentic, multi-time award winning New York Pizzeria. The menu is diverse, yet family-friendly, serving all of your Italian American favorites headlining with unique appetizers, salads, and gluten free choices.\nCraving the perfect New York Slice?! We have Florida’s largest variety of hand stretched, gourmet pizza, made lovingly all day long in our exhibition kitchen.\nOur delivery drivers are professionals, properly trained, supervised, and friendly, unlike those third party delivery services. Quality counts more than ever and we believe in sustainability and only align ourselves with distributors that have the same philosophy. The food supply chain is monitored meticulously, sourced locally and organic when possible. Our producers adhere with the certified humane program which assure the meats, poultry, and dairy products we use were raised and treated humanely.\nOur Cheese\nThe mozzarella we use for our pizza is the best Italian cheese money can buy. It is produced in Brownsville Wisconsin and made from whole milk, harvested daily, and has a 5-star rating from the milk and dairy board.\nTomatoes\nThe tomatoes we use for our sauces are grown in Modesto, CA. They are picked and packed within three hours, and are 100% pure....there are never any citric acid, preservatives, or other chemicals added.\nOur Sauce\nOur pizza sauce is made with many spices and fresh herbs including, sea salt, finely cracked pepper, Sicilian oregano, fresh garlic, parsley, basil, grated pecorino romano, and a nice touch of extra virgin olive oil.\nOur Dough\nOur pizza dough is made from wheat grown in the Prairie Providence of Manitoba Canada and milled in the USA, more refined than the classic double zero flour. We use a mother dough and cold rise ferment for 48+ hours. This yields a pizza that is more flavorful, lighter, and crispy.\nBecause of our long multi-step fermentation process, our dough has a naturally occurring pro-biotic component to it, which makes our pizza very easy to digest. We have had a lot of success feeding our pizza to people that have gluten intolerance. All sauces, dressings, and baking are executed on the premise in our scratch laboratory. Bronx House\n’\ns mission is to exceed expectations for comfort, style, service, quality, and overall satisfaction, striving to be Florida\n’\ns top pizza experience.\nLearn More About Fermentation and Your Health\nBruno\nMike\nOrder online, or pick your location and give us a visit today!\nOrder Online\nLocations",
