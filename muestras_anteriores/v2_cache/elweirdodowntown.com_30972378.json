Individually, each mural and installation is stunning but when combined, their collective magic transforms a tiny tacopub into a work of art.\nChriston Anderson\nJourney behind the brew space and direct your gaze toward a couple of Giraffstronauts flying sneaker shuttles to the moon surrounded by a galaxy full of polka dots. This epically weird adventure scene is Christon’s creation.\nInstagram -\n@christonanderson\nBeau Bradbury\nThe back hallway of El Weirdo is full of found objects, graffiti, magazine clippings, and a ton of weird stuff that defies comprehension. Beau did that. We’re still not sure where he found all of that stuff and we think it’s best not to ask.\nInstagram -\n@_beaubradbury\nAnastasia Dengerud\nHave you noticed all of those wonderful little faces hidden amongst the plants in the front seating area of El Weirdo? They all came from Anastasia’s vivid imagination. Goats, fish, cats, and even a self-portrait or two.\nInstagram -\n@ana.zasia\nSara Griffith\nIf you feel like you’re being watched it’s because Sara painted eyeballs all over the walls that wrap around our brew space. She also added Venus flytraps, Voodoo dolls, and something about chest hair on the AC duct above the bar.\nInstagram -\n@enjoyartbysara\nJD Justice\nJD’s penchant for pop art and cryptozoology inspired his monstrous design for our arcade wall. These creatures are rarely if ever seen in the wild but here at El Weirdo, they feel safe amongst all you weirdos.\nInstagram -\n@art.by.mr.j\nAnna Kaye\nThe robot taco battle going down in the bathroom is the mechanized punk rock apocalypse fever dream of the one and only Anna Kaye. Take a seat, grab a selfie with Potty Bot 9000, and navigate your way through the brain maze. Good luck!\nInstagram -\n@artbyakaye\nTerry Knight\nIf you’ve ever wanted to transcend reality while taking a potty break now’s your chance. Terry spent weeks and weeks filling our bathroom with thought-expanding sacred geometry and trippy shapes. Enjoy the good vibes, my friend.\nInstagram -\n@terryknightart\nAlfredo Leon\nAt the tender age of six, Alfie became a Lego Maniac. Do you see our Lego Logo above the bar? It’s comprised of approximately a million Lego blocks and this talented young man put ‘em all together. It’s Legoriffic!\nShiloh Murrell\nThe bars at El Weirdo are covered with little dudes thanks the big dude who doodled them. Shiloh spent hours creating a tiny world of friendly characters in various states of being. Great job dude! He has also created original “Shlump” artwork for our merch and it is glorious.\nInstagram -\n@shilohikem\nMorgan Elyce Summers\nMorgan’s inspiration comes from the style and precision of classic sign painting. From the “We are the weirdos” motto near the bar to the massive mural that wraps around El Weirdo she created it all.\nInstagram -\n@uhbeautifulmes\nAaron Waldrep\nWhat do the Junknado, Blue Moon, Phurbhurt the Scrap Goblin, the benches you’re sitting on, the tables and bar you’re sitting at, and just about every other engineered structure in El Weirdo have in common? They were built by Aaron.\nMeet the Artists of El Weirdo\nChriston Anderson\nBeau Bradbury\nAnastasia Dengerud\nSara Griffith\nJD Justice\nAnna Kaye\nTerry Knight\nAlfredo Leon\nShiloh Murrell\nMorgan Summers\nAaron Waldrep\nScroll\nMeet The Artists\nEl Weirdo is what happens when a bunch of artists are given strict orders to create whatever the heck they want.
