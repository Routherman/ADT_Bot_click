We are experiencing our most challenging strawberry crop in a decade. We attribute this mainly to the freeze that we had at the end of December, where we used water to save our citrus trees. The days of running sprinklers saved our trees, but it reduced the fertility in the soil. We traded off a strawberry crop for 2023 for the potential of citrus over the next decade. We also experienced pest pressure which caused cosmetic damage to the fruit that did grow. Our yields are the lowest we have ever seen, and those who have visited our U-Pick before will recall that previous years were much more abundant. We’ve been watching field conditions carefully, but the abundant yield has not appeared yet.\nKnowing there were just a few sweet and delicious gems out in the field, we set up a reservation system for strawberries. We’ve now closed reservations to the field.\nNormally this time of year we are swimming in strawberries, sometimes picking over two hundred pounds at a time. This year is a bit different but we will make the best of it. As farmers we are at the mercy of the weather and natural cycles, and in control of very little beyond how we interact with our soil and crops. We are still making a limited amount of jam with the berries that we are harvesting, so make sure to pick up a jar while it lasts. We’ll enjoy this sweet treat and look forward to a more abundant strawberry crop next year!\nSpecial Events\nUPCOMING EVENTS\nMeat & Greet – Chef’s Tasting Menu & Farm Tour\nSpecial bundle discounts on meat packages!\nReserve your tickets here – $39 per person\nPAST EVENTS\nCANE BOIL – January 11, 2025\nThank you to everyone who braved the chilly weather and joined us for our 2025\nCane\nBoil\n& BBQ!
