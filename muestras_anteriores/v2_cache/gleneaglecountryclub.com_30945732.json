      "text": "About Glen Eagle Golf & Country Club\nPurposefully Planned. Rooted in Community.\nGlen Eagle Golf & Country Club is a private, gated, deeded, membership community with 15 unique neighborhood communities that offer residences ranging from condos to villas to private homes. With 924 golf memberships and 310 social memberships available in the heart of Naples, Florida, residents can enjoy the complete country club experience just minutes from fine dining, boating and fishing, high-end shopping, world-class cultural attractions and the Gulf.\nRequest Tour\nExplore Lifestyle Amenities\nOur History\nGlen Eagle Golf & Country Club was established in the early 1990s on land originally used as a private hunting and fishing retreat. What started as Embassy Woods Golf and Country Club evolved into a thoughtfully planned, private golf community just minutes from downtown Naples. The community’s 18-hole course, designed by Mark McCumber, opened in 1991 as a public course.\nAs the community grew, residents took an active role in its governance and development. In 1998, the community changed hands and was renamed Glen Eagle Golf & Country Club in 1998. By 2004, homeowners gained full ownership and control of the Club, selecting the first general manager.\nSince then, Glen Eagle has continued to invest in its lifestyle amenities, including golf course improvements by the famed Gordon Lewis. The years have also brought many neighborhood and facilities enhancements – all while preserving the close-knit, welcoming character that defines the community today.\nGolf Membership\nA golf membership entitles the owner to the full use of all facilities and the golf course year-round.
