We're nestled in an easily accessible area centrally located in Dunedin. A recent poll just listed Dunedin as one of the top 10 cities to live in Florida!\nDesignated as an age 55+ community, we enjoy lively days and quiet sunsets often speckled with various activities and events.\nDuring the Winter months, the Dunedin Palms calendar is \"chock\" full and there's always something going on to suit just about everyone! Four regulation size Shuffleboard Courts, a large heated swimming pool and a 2100 sq' Clubhouse are just a few of the amenities that keep us busy. We even have a Men's and Women's Golf League!\nWe're just a short drive to all types of shopping, and some of the most beautiful beaches in the world are minutes away. In fact, Clearwater Beach has been named \"the Best Beach in Florida\" by USA Today! The Pinellas Walking/BikingTrail is nearby, and if you love baseball, the Spring Training camp for the Toronto Blue Jays is just around the corner. Main St., downtown, is a collection of eclectic fun shops and restaurants with something for everyone, and it's a short walk to view the most beautiful sunsets anywhere! Dunedin could possibly be the best city in America! Just\nclick here and see for yourself!\nSo when people ask us \"what's near Dunedin Palms?\".\nWe just tell them \"EVERYTHING\"!\nDunedin Palms\n130 Patricia Ave.\nDunedin FL, 34698\nOffice: 727-733-2393\nHome\n​\nWeb Hosting\nby iPage",
