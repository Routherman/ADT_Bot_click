We installed a hybrid 3.5/5 barrel brew-house, right in the center of our space, which also features a concrete-topped bar, a comfortable dining room, a beautiful (dog-friendly) patio, and a semi-open kitchen. We offer 10 house beers on tap, with a wide variety of styles from Sours and Goldens to Pale Ales, IPAs, Porters, Stouts, and Belgian beers. There are always some new and exciting beers available like a Chili Pepper Pale Ale or a Brett Biere de Garde.\nIn addition, we have a separate fermentation room, which we call The Funk Room, designed specifically for sour and wild-fermented beers such as Berliner Weisse, Gose, and Lambic beers. Big Slide pushes the envelope of beer styles. In the middle of the bar, you will see a wall of wooden barrels which is our extensive barrel-aging program at work, where we use bourbon, red wine, and fresh oak barrels to age our brews.\nOur Beer\nOur Food\nOur chefs source most of our ingredients locally, and we offer the freshest food in the area.

After finding a keen interest in the brewery/ restaurant industry,  Anthony spent many summers returning to the Pub and began working many positions full time in the restaurant, ultimately landing here at Big Slide Brewery as General Manager. Recently married in October 2024 Anthony lives here in Lake Placid with his wife and son. In his off time, you can usually find him on many of the local golf courses or fishing on the surrounding lakes.\nKEVIN LITCHFIELD\nDIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS\nKevin began his brewing career right out of Paul Smith’s College, hired as the first brewer to take over for Owner/Brewmaster, Chris Ericson in the fall of 1999, when the company was only 3 years old. Growing with the company over the years, Kevin has had the pleasure of working with many very talented brewers, and has learned a great deal from each one of them, compiling a wealth of brewing knowledge that continues to grow every day. Currently, as the Director of Brewing Operations for both the Lake Placid Pub & Brewery and Big Slide Brewing Company, he manages all aspects of Production Brewing, including recipe formulation, quality assurance, brewery maintenance, and day to day production. His passion for craft beer and dedication to producing the highest quality beer, drive him to continue researching and learning within the brewing community. In his free time, Kevin enjoys living and playing in the Adirondack Wilderness, including hiking, camping, paddling, biking, and swimming. Kevin is a six time finisher of the Lake Placid Ironman Triathlon, an Adirondack 46er, and is currently on a lifelong quest of running a marathon in all 50 states, while stopping for a delicious local beer along the way.
