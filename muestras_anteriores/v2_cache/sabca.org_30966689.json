      "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\nWHAT IS MUSIC BY THE SEA\nHistory – 20 years ago, Robert and Andrea Samuels noticed on almost any weeknight, the Pier Pavilion was empty. It also occurred to them there was lack of any sort of local gathering for the city residents. They decided to try and throw a free social to allow residents to have fun and get better acquainted. This resulted in the birth of Music by the Sea. Season one included one concert each month during the summer. The first show included a 3-piece band, a hot dog vendor and about 40 residents. In 2019 we rebranded the event to showcase local art. Thanks to the Art Studio Group for helping us evolve to what we now call Music & Art by the Sea. To steal a line from an old TV commercial “we’ve come a long way baby!”. In 2022 we celebrate 20 years of beautiful music, community pride and the anniversary of an event many people that would never work.\nThis success is due in part to the efforts of SABCA, but credit also goes to many others. Our concert partner-sponsors, in recent years the SJC Tourism Development Council, local restaurant and food trucks! The City of St Augustine Beach and St Johns County Parks & Recreation have been extremely helpful. And last but certainly not least, we thank the bands that have graciously played our stage! We certainly could not have done this without all of you!\nABOUT THE BEACH MUSIC & ARTS FUND\nThe Beach Music & Arts Fund (BMAF) serves as the fundraising arm for SABCA. Funds raised support arts-related events and activities within our community. No Board Members receive compensation for their work with BMAF or SABCA. The BMAF, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, conducts donations, raffles, and other fundraising efforts. The collected funds are used to pay bands and performers at community events, provide scholarships for young people to attend Camp Rock and art classes, and support various programs that promote art and music in our local community.\nPARKING INFORMATION\n<span class=\"so-premium-web-font\" style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-style: normal; font-size: 16px;\" data-web-font-module=\"web_safe\" data-font-info=\"{&quot;font&quot;:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;webfont&quot;:false,&quot;variant&quot;:null,&quot;module&quot;:&quot;web_safe&quot;}\">Take the Shuttle to our Free Concerts!
