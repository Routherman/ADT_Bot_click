Any person desiring to qualify as a candidate for any elective office must present to the village clerk all documentation and/or fees required by state law, as it may be amended from time to time, along with a ten dollar ($10.00) filing fee, proof that the person seeking office is indeed a duly registered elector of the village and meets the above-referenced residency requirements.
