      "text": "About Holiday Cove\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap\nAbout Us\nSurrounded by palm trees, Holiday Cove is a representation of Old Florida. Located in the heart of the fishing village of Cortez on Florida’s west coast, the resort offers comfortable paved sites and attentive service by our resort staff. It is ideal for those who are looking for a life style in a natural environment.\nA walk across or along the street on a side walk offers a variety of shops, restaurants, a convenience store and post office. Holiday Cove provides its residents with a boat ramp and boat slips for small boats, or for those who prefer it, a covered boat storage facility is located next to the resort. The trip through our canal to the Coastal Waterway (ICW), is 1/4 mile.\ncol\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap\nAerial Video of Holiday Cove\nARVE\nError:\nARVE\nError: maxwidth:\n1000px\nis not valid\nmaxwidth:\n1000px\nis not valid\nMode: lightbox not available (ARVE Pro not active?), switching to normal mode\ncol\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap\nNearby Shopping, Dining, Golf and Attractions\nBradenton Boat Club\n(200 Feet)\nCortez Post Office\n(250 Feet)\nFlorida Maritime Museum at Cortez\n(0.2 miles)\nSeafood Shack Marina\n(0.7 miles)\nPublix Supermarket\n(0.8 miles)\nThe Beachhouse Restaurant\n(1.3 miles)\nThe Sun House Restaurant\n(1.3 miles)\nRotten Ralphs Restaurants\n(1.5 miles)\nAnna Maria Oyster Bar\n(3.3 miles)\nPalma Sola Bay Club\n(3.4 miles)\ncol\nThe Beach Bistro\n(3.8 miles)\nManatee County Golf Course\n(4.6 miles)\nAMF Bradenton Lanes\n(4.9 miles)\nCannons Marina\n(5.0 miles)\nEuphemia Haye\n(5.8 miles)\nThe Sandbar Restaurant\n(6.3 miles)\nAnna Maria Island Community Center\n(7.1 miles)\nDeSoto Square Shopping Mall\n(7.7 miles)\nPittsburgh Pirates – McKechnie Field\n(8.6 miles)\ncol\nTwin Dolphin Marina & Restaurant\n(8.7 miles)\nSarasota Bradenton Int’l Airport\n(9.5 miles)\nMixon Fruit Farms\n(10.3 miles)\nManatee Memorial Hospital\n(13.6 miles)\nRed Barn Flea Market\n(14.1 miles)\nSt. Armand’s Circle\n(15 miles)\nBaltimore Orioles – Ed Smith Stadium\n(18.2 miles)\nTampa Bay Rays – Tropicana Field\n(33.2 miles)\ncol\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap\nHoliday Cove is Rated One of the Top RV Resorts in Florida!\nBrowse Online & Call Us Today!\nContact Us\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap\nContact Us\n(941) 251 - 7809\n11900 Cortez Road West\nPO Box 713, Cortez, FL, 34215\ninfo@holidaycovervinc.com\ncenter-in\nwidget\nfooter-left\nBegin Gallery\nFrom the Gallery\nEnd Gallery\nwidget\nfooter-middle\nfooter-right\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap\nCopyright © Holiday Cove RV, 2022.\nBradenton & Sarasota WordPress Website Hosting\nby Starwheel Websites.\ncontainer\ncontainer-wrap",
