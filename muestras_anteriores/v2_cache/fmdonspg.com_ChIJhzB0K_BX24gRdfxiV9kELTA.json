      "text": "About Chef Keith Meyer\n​\nAfter 10 years in the financial world, Chef Keith decided to pursue his passion for cooking. He moved to New York City and attended the French Culinary Institute.\n​\nAfter graduating, he furthered his craft in New York at San Domenico and Lever House, both Michelin star restaurants, under notable chefs Odetta Fada and Dan Silverman, respectively.\n​\nAfter moving to Southwest Florida, Chef Keith soon became a Punta Gorda favorite, serving for six years as Trabue’s executive chef/general manager. His finance background helped him run both the front and the back of a chef-driven house where he could be intensely hands-on and never had to sacrifice quality.\n​\nChef Keith utilizes French techniques while keeping the menu fresh, varied and approachable. He continues his practice of visiting the dining room to reveal cooking techniques and share in guests’ satisfaction.\n​\nChef Keith is married to NBC2 News Anchor Stacey Deffenbaugh\nChef Keith Meyer - FM Dons\nChef Keith Meyer - FM Dons\nChef Keith Meyer - FM Dons\nChef Keith Meyer - FM Dons\n1/3",
