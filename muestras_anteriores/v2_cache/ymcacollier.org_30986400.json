Working parents need quality, safe child care they feel good about. A well-rounded benefits package, one that includes a YMCA of Collier County membership, is attractive to current and potential employees.\nAn estimated 25-30% of companies’ medical costs per year were spent on employees with excess, often preventable, health risks. Other benefits that companies see include:\nReduced Healthcare Costs:\nThe majority of US health care expenses can be attributed to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Positive lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity and a healthy diet, can often prevent these costly medical conditions before they arise.\nIncreased Productivity and Morale:\nWorkers who exercise regularly tend to have more energy and be more productive while at work. As little as 30 minutes of physical activity several days a week can have a significant positive impact on workers’ physical and mental well-being.\nDecreased Turnover and Increased Recruitment Potential:\nMany employees view health promotion programs as an added perk that makes them feel valued and appreciated by their employer. Employees who feel valued are less likely to seek employment elsewhere, decreasing turnover and the time and money needed to recruit, hire and train new workers. Similarly, a well-being program can serve as a valuable recruiting tool as you seek to attract the best possible talent to your organization.\nDecreased Absenteeism:\nEmployees suffering from a chronic health condition are more likely to miss work than healthy employees.

To ensure this, we require a government-issued ID for all individuals aged 18 and older entering our facilities. This ID is used for conducting a sex offender background check, and verifying identity when necessary. This applies to all individuals, including members, guests, spectators, and visitors. Please note that all personal information collected is confidential and will not be shared, except as required by law or for safety purposes.\nYear-round and Monthly (Seasonal) Memberships\nMemberships are non-refundable and non-transferable. Year-round memberships must be renewed within 90 days of expiring/deactivation to avoid paying a Join Fee.\nJoin Fee\nJoin Fees are non-refundable. If a membership has lapsed for more than 90 days from the last draft, the full Join Fee must be paid upon return.\nContinuous Monthly Membership Dues\nDues are continuous every month until the proper change procedure is followed.\nIf for any reason your check or electronic draft is returned, it may be collected electronically through a third party vendor. A minimum return fee of $30 will be assessed for this service.\nThe YMCA is not responsible for any other collection fees assessed by individual banking institutions.\nMembers whose electronic draft is returned and not resolved prior to the next draft date will have their membership canceled by the YMCA. In order to reinstate a membership, all outstanding balances must be paid in full.\nCredit Card Service Fee\nA service fee of three percent (3%) will be applied to all credit card transactions and payments processed using a credit card. This fee helps offset the cost of credit card processing and is non-refundable. Members may avoid this fee by choosing to pay via electronic funds transfer (EFT) or other accepted payment methods that do not incur the service fee.\nMembership Cancellation\nTo cancel your membership, please provide a 30-day written notice.\nThis can be done online through our\nMembership Change Web Form\nor in person at our facility. Please note that verbal or phone cancellations are not accepted.\nREQUEST CANCELLATION\nThere are third-party companies that falsely claim they can manage changes to your Y membership for a fee. These companies are not affiliated with the Y and often mislead individuals for profit. You never have to pay to change or cancel your membership. If you have questions, please contact us.\nMembership Holds\nMembers may place their membership on hold for up to 3 months per year. This can be done online through our Membership Change Web Form or in person at our facility. Your membership will automatically resume after the hold expires. Please note that the YMCA will not send a reminder prior to reinstatement.\nIf you wish to cancel your membership during the hold period, please notify the YMCA before your reinstatement date. No refunds will be issued for drafts processed after reinstatement.\nREQUEST HOLD\nmember code of conduct\nThe YMCA is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all members and guests.

We expect persons using the YMCA to act maturely, to behave responsibly, and to respect the rights and dignity of others. Our Member’s Code of Conduct outlines prohibited behavior, but the actions listed below are not an all-inclusive list of behaviors considered inappropriate in our facilities or programs:\nUsing or possessing alcohol or illegal chemicals on YMCA property\nYMCA facilities and grounds are smoke-free environments.\nCarrying or concealing a weapon or any device or object that may be used as a weapon\nUse of cell phones in the YMCA’s shower and locker room areas\nUse of any video/picture taking equipment, including camera phones, in YMCA’s shower rooms, locker rooms, and fitness center area\nHarassment or intimidation by words, gestures, body language, or any type of menacing behavior\nPhysical contact with another person in an angry, aggressive or threatening way\nVerbally abusive behavior, including angry or vulgar language, swearing, name-calling, or shouting\nSexually explicit conversation or behavior: any sexual contact with another person\nInappropriate, immodest, or sexually revealing attire\nTheft or behavior that results in the destruction or loss of property\nLoitering within or on the grounds of the YMCA\nIn addition, the YMCA reserves the right to deny access or membership to any person who has been accused or convicted of any crime involving sexual abuse, is or has been a registered sex offender, has ever been convicted of any offense relating to the use, sale, possession, or transportation of narcotics or habit forming and/or dangerous drugs, or is presently or habitually under the influence of dangerous drugs or chemicals, narcotics, or intoxicating beverages.\nIf a member or guest feels uncomfortable, they should report the behavior to a staff immediately.
