The nature center opened its doors in 1998 and quickly captivated the interest of students, teachers, naturalists, community leaders, visitors and residents of Delray Beach and surrounding communities. The unique facility is an exciting hands-on learning experience, which focuses on Florida’s fragile ecosystems and their inhabitants.\nVisitors of all ages can get an up-close view of some of Florida’s native and invasive reptile species,\nmeet sharks and other fish at the center’s 15,000- gallon reef pool, explore Southeast Florida’s largest shell collection and join us for special events such as Earth Day and beach clean-ups. The center’s children’s activity room is a great spot to read stories, learn about the life cycle of a butterfly and look at interesting things under the microscope. The observation deck, butterfly garden, and dune exhibit also allow visitors to learn about our unique coastal environment. Sandoway Discovery Center is an historic home where one can experience Delray’s rich natural history through a self-guided tour. The open-air porch, Dade County pine floors, Bald Cypress ceilings, French doors and arched window on the staircase, are just some of the architectural details that evoke impressions of early beach-front living.\nThe nature center’s activities include daily shark and stingray feedings, aquarium feedings, animal encounters,\nfield trip and outreach programs, beach clean-ups, butterfly garden, live animal exhibits, and more. The Friends of Sandoway House Nature Center, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public about Delray’s coastal and marine ecosystems as well as Florida’s natural history all to benefit future generations.\nWant to make a strong impact?
