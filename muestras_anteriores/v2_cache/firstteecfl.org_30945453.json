That’s why we place such a strong emphasis on class management. But what does that mean for your child?\nIt means we’re committed to creating an environment where your child feels seen, supported and inspired — not just to learn golf, but to build confidence, character and life skills.\nBuilding relationships first\nOur coaches start by getting to know each participant. Greeting kids by name, asking about their day and showing genuine interest helps your child feel like they belong. When children feel respected and valued, they’re more likely to engage positively and feel confident in their surroundings.\nClear expectations = safe kids\nWe work with participants to set clear, age-appropriate expectations that keep everyone safe and focused. For example:\n“Stop, look and listen on the coach’s signal.”\n“Stay in the safety zone when not hitting.”\n“Only swing in the hitting area.”\nBy involving kids in creating these expectations, they understand not just the rules, but the reasons behind them. This helps them take ownership of their behavior and feel more invested in the group’s success.\nKeeping kids engaged and active\nWe know that kids learn best when they’re active and having fun. That’s why our sessions are designed to keep everyone moving, learning and participating. We use stations, group rotations and fun visuals to keep things fresh and safe. Even when it’s not their turn, kids are encouraged to help a partner or review what they’ve learned.\nAnd safety isn’t just physical — it’s emotional too. Our coaches use positive reinforcement and fair, consistent responses to behavior, helping every child feel secure and supported.\nConsistency builds confidence\nSimple cues like a whistle or a phrase (“1, 2, 3, all eyes on me”) help coaches get kids’ attention quickly and respectfully. Using the same cues across all classes helps your child know what to expect, which builds confidence and comfort.\nOur coaches are trained to support your child\nAt First Tee, our coaches are more than instructors — they’re mentors. Each coach receives training in youth development, class management and safety practices. We also partner with trusted organizations like the Positive Coaching Alliance to ensure our team is equipped with the latest tools and strategies to support your child’s growth — on and off the course. Through ongoing learning and development, our coaches are prepared to create a positive, inclusive and empowering experience for every participant.\nTogether, we’re creating a space where your child can feel safe, supported and ready to grow — not just as a golfer, but as a person. Because when we manage our classes with care, we make room for character to shine.\nFind a First Tee Chapter\nnear you!\n.entry-content\n#post-6348\nCreating a safe and supportive learning environment for your child: Why class management matters at First Tee\n.entry-header\nBy Kristin Westberg – Senior Director, Training & Evaluation\nAt First Tee, we believe every child deserves a safe, welcoming and empowering space to grow — both on and off the golf course.
