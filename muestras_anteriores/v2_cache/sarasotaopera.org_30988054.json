Private meeting space, as well as private rehearsal rooms are part of the pavilion. The William E. Schmidt Opera Theatre seats 1,119.\nTheater History\nArthur Britton (\"A.B.\") Edwards was born in Sarasota in 1874. A true business pioneer, he not only established the first real estate office in Sarasota in 1903, he became the first mayor. Archival photos reveal Sarasota as a simple hamlet with buildings of wood and riddled with bungalow hideaways. The handsome little town was beginning to take its place on the resort map. Edwards had a vision for Sarasota, and with the infusion of an increasingly healthy real estate market (due largely to the efforts of John Ringling) he set out to realize his dream. Mr. Edwards commissioned Jacksonville architect, Roy A. Benjamin to design a \"multi-purpose\" building that could accommodate all types of entertainment- including opera.\nOn April 10, 1926, the A.B. Edwards Theater was unveiled. The Sarasota Herald Tribune hailed Edwards for \"having admitted Sarasota into a fairyland of costly decoration, rich furnishings and never to be forgotten artistry\". The entrance facade of the theater was designed in the very popular Mediterranean Revival style of the era. Cream colored stucco embellished with ornamental plasterwork and imitation stone delighted the opening night audience. The elaborate three-story entrance contained 8 shops on the ground floor, 12 offices on the second floor, and 12 furnished apartments on the third. All floors faced a central atrium. The theater auditorium, stage and fly tower occupied the remainder of the building. A glorious Robert Morton orchestral pipe organ completed the stunning scenario. Edwards had realized his vision.\nThe theater became a popular venue for a variety of entertainment's over the years. The top headliners of the time were to grace its stage: Will Rogers (1927), Sally Rand (1937), the Ziegfeld Follies (1928), and even (in 1956) the young Elvis Presley. On January 31, 1952, it became host to the world premiere blockbuster DeMille movie, \"The Greatest Show on Earth,\" which had been filmed in Sarasota. Charlton Heston, Betty Hutton, and Dorothy Lamour brightened the town with stardom.\nThe years were not kind to the original integrity of the Edwards Theater. New management renamed the building \"The Florida Theater.\" In 1928, a hurricane irrevocably damaged the magnificent Rogers Morton pipe organ. Late modernizing included stripping the structure of many of its most exquisite Art Deco charms. To accommodate the ever-changing entertainment industry, further alterations were made. The theater became a movie theater, complete with plastic laminate and linoleum. Then in 1973, the theater closed.\nMeanwhile, a non-profit organization called the Asolo Opera Guild had been hard at work bringing opera to Sarasota. With modest beginnings, they presented chamber-size repertoire in the Asolo Theater, a small 320-seat playhouse located on the Ringling Museum grounds. By 1974, they began to produce their own operas. With public support rapidly growing, they clearly needed a home to call their own. In 1979, the Guild purchased the old Edwards Theater for $173,000. The Association became the 7th opera company in the United States to own its house.\nA series of renovations during the early 80s and 90s were undertaken to bring the theater back from the brink and to make it a viable operatic venue. Work was done as funds permitted. By 1984 the stage, orchestra pit, and orchestra section were done to open the theater with its first production, Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, under Victor DeRenzi's baton with leading roles taken by Stephanie Sundine, Mimi Lerner, Marc Embree, and Jerry Hadley. The balcony was ready by 1990, and by 1993 the lobby and facade had been restored. The company also built the adjacent Artists Wing in the early 80s and purchased the Ringling Terrace Apartment complex, where the Apprentice Artists were housed. In the mid 90's the adjacent building was also acquired to become the Pavilion building, home to the Jonas Kamlet Library, the Peterson Great Room, and the Culverhouse Room.\nHowever, years of neglect had taken their toll and a more extensive overhaul was indicated. From March 2007 to February 2008 Sarasota Opera embarked on the first holistic renovation of the original 1926 structure. The interior of the auditorium was gutted to allow the digging of a new larger orchestra pit and a regrading of the orchestra section floor to improve sightlines. New seats and historically appropriate decorations enhance the theater space. The backstage facilities were updated, and the orchestra fitted with a hydraulic lift. The lobby features a restored three-story atrium as well as additional restrooms, lounges, and other audience amenities.

On January 31, 1952, it became host to the world premiere blockbuster DeMille movie, \"The Greatest Show on Earth,\" which had been filmed in Sarasota. Charlton Heston, Betty Hutton, and Dorothy Lamour brightened the town with stardom.\nThe years were not kind to the original integrity of the Edwards Theater. New management renamed the building \"The Florida Theater.\" In 1928, a hurricane irrevocably damaged the magnificent Rogers Morton pipe organ. Late modernizing included stripping the structure of many of its most exquisite Art Deco charms. To accommodate the ever-changing entertainment industry, further alterations were made. The theater became a movie theater, complete with plastic laminate and linoleum. Then in 1973, the theater closed.\nMeanwhile, a non-profit organization called the Asolo Opera Guild had been hard at work bringing opera to Sarasota. With modest beginnings, they presented chamber-size repertoire in the Asolo Theater, a small 320-seat playhouse located on the Ringling Museum grounds. By 1974, they began to produce their own operas. With public support rapidly growing, they clearly needed a home to call their own. In 1979, the Guild purchased the old Edwards Theater for $173,000. The Association became the 7th opera company in the United States to own its house.\nA series of renovations during the early 80s and 90s were undertaken to bring the theater back from the brink and to make it a viable operatic venue. Work was done as funds permitted. By 1984 the stage, orchestra pit, and orchestra section were done to open the theater with its first production, Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, under Victor DeRenzi's baton with leading roles taken by Stephanie Sundine, Mimi Lerner, Marc Embree, and Jerry Hadley. The balcony was ready by 1990, and by 1993 the lobby and facade had been restored. The company also built the adjacent Artists Wing in the early 80s and purchased the Ringling Terrace Apartment complex, where the Apprentice Artists were housed. In the mid 90's the adjacent building was also acquired to become the Pavilion building, home to the Jonas Kamlet Library, the Peterson Great Room, and the Culverhouse Room.\nHowever, years of neglect had taken their toll and a more extensive overhaul was indicated. From March 2007 to February 2008 Sarasota Opera embarked on the first holistic renovation of the original 1926 structure. The interior of the auditorium was gutted to allow the digging of a new larger orchestra pit and a regrading of the orchestra section floor to improve sightlines. New seats and historically appropriate decorations enhance the theater space. The backstage facilities were updated, and the orchestra fitted with a hydraulic lift. The lobby features a restored three-story atrium as well as additional restrooms, lounges, and other audience amenities. At the completion of the $20 million project Musical America called the Sarasota Opera House \"one of the finest venues for opera in the United States.\"\nFirst Slide\nLast Slide\nAbout Sarasota Opera House\n\"One of the finest venues for opera in America\"\n—MusicalAmerica.com\n\"In the winter, it would be hard to beat the pleasantly laid-back resort town of Sarasota on Florida's west coast, with its warm and sunny weather, excellent restaurants, and a delightful 1000 seat art deco Opera House, whose acoustics are superb.\"\n—OPERA, London\n\"With the dimensions of the Opera House, which almost guarantee an engaging experience between audience and singers, and DeRenzi's full throttle approach to each work, whether he's conducting it or not, a dull performance at the Sarasota Opera is hard to come by.\"\n—OPERA NEWS, New York\n\"Sarasota Opera—A Gem on Florida's Gulf Coast ...The theater's interior configuration and acoustics make audience members feel they are sitting in the center of the sound.\"\n—THE BLADE, Toledo\n\"Over the last decade, the output has been first-rate, blending traditional with adventurous programming ... an acoustical jewel.\"\n—BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE\nThe Sarasota Opera House plays host to everything from opera, symphony and classical ballet to film festivals, popular music concerts, comedy shows and clowns. In addition to the theater, the Opera Complex includes a Pavilion with a spacious, multi-purpose banquet/performance facility; the Lee and Bob Peterson Great Room, which can seat up to 339 people. Private meeting space, as well as private rehearsal rooms are part of the pavilion. The William E. Schmidt Opera Theatre seats 1,119.\nTheater History\nArthur Britton (\"A.B.\") Edwards was born in Sarasota in 1874. A true business pioneer, he not only established the first real estate office in Sarasota in 1903, he became the first mayor. Archival photos reveal Sarasota as a simple hamlet with buildings of wood and riddled with bungalow hideaways. The handsome little town was beginning to take its place on the resort map. Edwards had a vision for Sarasota, and with the infusion of an increasingly healthy real estate market (due largely to the efforts of John Ringling) he set out to realize his dream. Mr. Edwards commissioned Jacksonville architect, Roy A. Benjamin to design a \"multi-purpose\" building that could accommodate all types of entertainment- including opera.\nOn April 10, 1926, the A.B. Edwards Theater was unveiled. The Sarasota Herald Tribune hailed Edwards for \"having admitted Sarasota into a fairyland of costly decoration, rich furnishings and never to be forgotten artistry\". The entrance facade of the theater was designed in the very popular Mediterranean Revival style of the era. Cream colored stucco embellished with ornamental plasterwork and imitation stone delighted the opening night audience. The elaborate three-story entrance contained 8 shops on the ground floor, 12 offices on the second floor, and 12 furnished apartments on the third. All floors faced a central atrium. The theater auditorium, stage and fly tower occupied the remainder of the building. A glorious Robert Morton orchestral pipe organ completed the stunning scenario. Edwards had realized his vision.\nThe theater became a popular venue for a variety of entertainment's over the years. The top headliners of the time were to grace its stage: Will Rogers (1927), Sally Rand (1937), the Ziegfeld Follies (1928), and even (in 1956) the young Elvis Presley. On January 31, 1952, it became host to the world premiere blockbuster DeMille movie, \"The Greatest Show on Earth,\" which had been filmed in Sarasota.

      "text": "Leadership\nVictor DeRenzi\nArtistic Director and Principal Conductor\nVictor DeRenzi is entering his 44th season as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Sarasota Opera\nwhere he has overseen over 1,500 opera performances, and 216 productions of 122 different operas. He has conducted over 1,200 performances of opera in his career - almost 900 of them at the Sarasota Opera - as well as numerous concerts. Mo DeRenzi is currently the longest-serving Artistic Director in America.\nHe devoted much of his career to building Sarasota Opera while continuing to conduct nationally and internationally. Maestro DeRenzi has appeared across the United States with Lyric Opera of Chicago as well as at the St. Louis, Toledo, New Orleans and New York City operas. Internationally he has worked in Nice, Edmonton, Québec City, Winnipeg, Hamilton, and at L'Opéra du Montréal. He was also a frequent visitor to opera companies in Hong Kong and the Canary Islands.\nMaestro DeRenzi's artistic vision has garnered the company international attention as a place to experience rarely performed works. He initiated Sarasota Opera's\nVerdi Cycle\n, which was concluded in 2016, making Sarasota Opera the only company in the world to have performed all of Verdi’s music. He began the Masterworks Revival Series, which produced neglected operas of significant artistic merit, and the American Classics Series dedicated to producing 20th Century operas by American composers.\nThis growth in the production of operas has been matched in other areas as well. Under Maestro DeRenzi's leadership, Sarasota Opera has created important educational and outreach activities. The year-round Sarasota Youth Opera Program introduces young people, ages 8 to 18, to all aspects of opera. The program constitutes remarkable learning and performing opportunities that include two Youth Opera Choruses and yearly performances on Sarasota Opera’s main stage of works written specifically for young voices, with all aspects of the productions overseen by professionals.\nMaestro DeRenzi's interest in the training of professional singers led to the founding of Sarasota Opera's Apprentice and Studio Artists programs. Chosen from national auditions, the participants in these programs form the chorus for the main stage opera productions, perform community outreach, understudy principal roles and perform secondary roles on the main stage. Many former Sarasota Opera Apprentice and Studio Artists have gone on to leading roles with the company as well as with other major opera houses around the world.\nMaestro DeRenzi is a noted Verdi specialist, being the only conductor to have conducted the entire canon of Verdi’s works. Arts Critic Lawrence Johnson wrote, “Victor DeRenzi is simply the finest, most idiomatic Verdi conductor I’ve ever heard, and I’m not forgetting some much more celebrated names.” Maestro DeRenzi has also edited a two-volume edition of Verdi’s songs with piano, many of which were not previously available.\nAlthough Maestro DeRenzi is a noted Italian opera conductor, his repertoire includes operas by Janáček, Mozart, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Smetana, and Stravinsky, among others. In 2025, he will be celebrating the 56th anniversary of his debut as a conductor.\nThe City of Sarasota has recognized him on four separate occasions for service to the community. He was featured on the cover of Sarasota Magazine, which has twice recognized him as one of Sarasota's 100 Most Powerful People. In 2015 Maestro DeRenzi was made a “Cavaliere dell’ordine della stella d’italia”, Knight of the Order of the Star of Italy, by the Italian Republic, for his work in bringing Italian culture beyond the borders of Italy.\nRichard Russell\nGeneral Director\nRichard Russell is General Director of Sarasota Opera. A former singer, he performed with the company for four seasons beginning in 1989 as an apprentice artist, studio artist, and principal. Among the roles he performed in other regional opera companies were Hoffman in The Tales of Hoffman, Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus, Rodolfo in La bohème, and the title role in Andrea Chenier. As a concert artist he sang the world premiere Lewis Rosengarten’s Three Poems by Arnaut Daniel for Tenor and Orchestra with the Alabama Symphony.\nAfter transitioning out of professional performing, he joined Citigroup’s Emerging Markets Sales and Trading group and within a short period he was a Vice-President and Global Webmaster for eCommerce efforts across Citigroup’s over 30 emerging markets countries in Latin America, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Africa.\nIn 2005, he accepted the position of Director of Marketing at Sarasota Opera. He left in 2010 to become General Director of Princeton-based Opera New Jersey, where he was in charge of both the artistic and administrative sides of the company. He returned to Sarasota in 2012 to become Executive Director. During his tenure Sarasota Opera has increased individual giving by over 50%, more than doubled its endowment, and completed its world-renowned Verdi Cycle. Mr. Russell managed the construction and fundraising for the new Steinwachs Artist Residences for Sarasota Opera, which encompasses 30 units housing up to 70 artists.\nHe also negotiated and managed the purchase of stock of over 55,000 opera costumes, representing 135 separate productions to increase Sarasota Opera's inventory of costumes available for its use and for rentals to other opera, theater, and film companies.\nHe was formerly on the board of the Arts & Cultural Alliance of Sarasota County and sits on the board of Visit Sarasota County, of which he is currently Chair.\nHe holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in voice performance and choral conducting from Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music.\nLeadership\nVictor DeRenzi\nArtistic Director and Principal Conductor\nVictor DeRenzi is entering his 44th season as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Sarasota Opera\nwhere he has overseen over 1,500 opera performances, and 216 productions of 122 different operas.
