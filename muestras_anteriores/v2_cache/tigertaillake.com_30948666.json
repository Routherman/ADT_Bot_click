Desired program outcomes can be as simple as team bonding experiences, as complex as team dynamic analysis, or anything in between!\nHalf Day\nThe half day program is up to 3.5 hours, and is perfect for ultra-focused outcomes and programming. The compact nature of the half-day program means we need to stay focused on just a handful of activities in order to achieve the desired outcomes. An example of a good candidate for a half-day program would be a team-building session that combines several hours of our world-renowned team-building with a session on the Tigertail Aerial Challenge O-Course, our new ropes course. Keep in mind that a 3.5 hour time block goes fast, and trying to cram too many activities into a half-day program can lead to feeling rushed or simply not reaching any of the desired outcomes.\nFull Day\nThe full day program\nHalf Day\nThe half day program is up to 3.5 hours, and is perfect for ultra-focused outcomes and programming.

To ask any questions directly to a team member, you can always\ncontact us\nor give us a call at\n954-201-4500\n.\nVIEW OUR FAQS\nCan you send me a list of all the possible team-building initiatives?\nOur professional  facilitators know thousands of different initiatives, and we’re happy to make suggestions based on your desired outcomes. We also sequence our programming dynamically based on the performance of the group so we might decide to call an ‘audible’ mid-program to ensure successful outcomes. That being said, it would be nearly impossible to send a complete list of team-building initiatives and selecting the initiatives ‘a la carte’ without a thorough understanding of program sequencing is unlikely to result in a great outcome. We encourage you to work with our program development team to get a suggested itinerary with alternate suggestions to ensure the best possible program.\nHow large/small a group can I bring?\nThe minimum group size depends on the type of program, but ranges from 5-10.  The maximum group size is only limited by your imagination, as long as you can’t imagine more than 500 people. But seriously, the maximum is actually determined by the type of program or event. We've accommodated several thousand people at the facility for a 'retreat' style of event, and our typical programs max out at several hundred. That's not to say we can't work with you, so please contact us and let us know what you've got in mind.\nWhat if it rains?\nIf it rains during your event, your event becomes 10x more extreme! Low ropes (team-building) activities may be moved to an indoor facility (pending availability) or under cover. Climbing and water activities may continue in the rain as long as facilitators and lifeguards can maintain visibility. However, in the event of lightning, all participants are required to seek shelter. Tigertail Lake is equipped with a Thorguard Lightning Prediction and Warning System.\nPsst... still have questions?\nWe’re here to help.

We have packages for everybody, and can even custom-tailor a package to create the perfect event.\nPrivate parties and events can be organized to take advantage of our rooms or our beautiful waterfront. You can even rent out the whole facility! Baby showers, wedding events, corporate retreats, conferences, workshops… you’re only limited by your imagination. Reach out to us at 954-201-4500 and we’ll happily discuss what you’ve got in mind and explore the possibilities.\nHow’s it all work?\nParty “packages” are three hours long and are booked in one of  the available time slots: either 9:30am-12:30pm, 1:30pm-4:30pm, or (during Summer) 5:00pm-8:00pm.\nEach party package features two one-hour sessions of activities, starting on the hour (so, for example, at 10:00am for the 9:30am time slot.) The half hour at the beginning and end of the party time slot are intended to give participants an opportunity to arrive, eat, socialize, etc. and are not considered part of the ‘activity sessions’.\nYou choose what activities you’d like during your activity sessions.\nAn hour rock climbing and an hour on the Tigertail Aqua Challenge. Stand-up paddleboarding for an hour and a session on the Tigertail Aqua Challenge. Two back-to-back sessions on the Tigertail Aqua Challenge. You get to choose the combination that works for you. Please note that some options do have limitations, so if you have questions or run into any trouble during the booking process let us know and one of our staff will help you figure out the best options. Also,\nthe activities available during your two activity hours are set during the booking process\nand may not be changed because we staff your party with skilled professionals ahead of time. For example, if you book a watersports party you may not change it to a climbing party when you arrive, or halfway through the party. Please plan accordingly.\nWhat’s Included?\nThe base package includes use of a covered shade tent area, 2 picnic tables, and shared use of the kitchen.\nIf you need more picnic tables, participants may occupy our public tables but they may not be moved under the shade areas; you may also choose to bring additional folding tables if you’d like. There are plenty of opportunities to upgrade your party with additional amenities, such as air conditioned rooms, pop-up tents, and more – if you have a particular need, give us a call and we can work on helping you add it to your party package. All parties are staffed with ACCT-certified Ropes Course Practitioners and American Red Cross-certified lifeguards to ensure safe operation and the safety of patrons. Minimum age for parties depends on the activities, so please make sure you let us know how old the participants will be ahead of time so we can make the right recommendations and ensure a great party!\nFood and drinks\nYou’re welcome to bring any food and drink options that you like, and cake! However,\nno alcohol is permitted on campus\n(or smoking.) If you want to leave the food preparation to the professionals, there are many wonderful catering options available, many pizza delivery services, even a private chef!\nWe even have a wonderful food truck available right on campus called\nEl Farolito\n, serving up world-famous delicacies from Argentina, or they can prepare any meal you like right on the premises (call 305-467-0391 for more information about El Farolito and what they can do for you.)\nEl Farolito is a phenomenal food truck and well-known in the South Florida “foodie” scene for its delicious Argentine fare. But that’s not all they can do for you! Regardless of the type of food, El Farolito can cater to your specific needs. The chef of El Farolito is well-versed in many different types of cuisine – all you have to do is reach out and let them know the details of your event.\nPLEASE NOTE: Party Packages are not private events!\nThe activity sessions are shared with the general public, and the facility is still open to the public, though pavilions and shade areas reserved for the party\nare\nprivate and for the exclusive use of the party. To make sessions private, there is an additional charge and it is possible to rent the entire facility (i.e. closed to the public.)
