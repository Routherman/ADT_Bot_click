The lines are blurred with melodic poetry, pulsating rhythms, impressionistic, improvisational sounds that are uniquely her own. Emotional, electronic and goose- bumpinducing jazz, r&b, reggae with afro cuban flair. Balancing a timeless sense of organic and electronic instrumentation with flutes, saxes, EWI, pulsing pianos and velvet voices. Kim Jays musical cocktail invites you to sit back and drink her riveting and emotionally arresting live performance. An experience to remember. Born in 1957 Klm Jay ( to family and friends) has been playing since 2001 as a soloist. Self taught by listening to: Sarah Vaughn, Cassandra Wilson, Shirley Horn, Carmen McCrae, MJQ, Mongo,Tito, Gato John Coltrane, Grover Washington Jr, Herber and Hubert Laws, Carmen Lundy, Curtis Lundy, Bobby Watson, Crosby, Still, Nash and Young. And everyone in between. “You never really master your instrument” Dizzy Gillespie\nKim Jay\nYears Experience\n0\nSingles\n0\nAlbums\n0\nYears Experience\n0\nSingles\n0\nAlbums\n0\nOur Newsletters\nFor Updates Stay Tuned With kimjjazz.\nEmail\nSubmit\nExperience the soulful sounds of Jazz and Blues, where every note tells a story.
