      "text": "About Us\nChef Carmelo's Ortigia Cucina & Bar is inspired by the beauty and flavors of the small town and region of Sicily that he is from.\nOrtigia is a coastal town in Sicily, Italy, steeped in history and culture. Ortigia is a small island that is connected to Syracuse by a bridge. The island is home to many historical sites, including the Temple of Apollo, the Cathedral of Syracuse, and the Fountain of Arethusa. Siracusa is a larger city that is also home to a number of historical sites, as well as museums, theaters, and restaurants.\nOne of the best things about Ortigia is the local food. The region is known for its fresh seafood, which is often caught and cooked the same day. There are also many traditional Sicilian dishes to try, such as pasta alla Norma, a dish made with eggplant, tomatoes, ricotta salata cheese, and basil.\nIn addition to the food, Ortigia and Siracusa are also known for their outdoor markets. The Mercato di Ortigia is a lively market that is open every day. Here you can find fresh produce, seafood, cheeses, meats, and other local products. The Mercato del Carmine is another popular market that is held every Saturday. This market is known for its antiques and handicrafts.\nThe beauty of Ortigia and Siracusa is also worth mentioning. The island of Ortigia is particularly charming, with its narrow streets, pastel-colored houses, and historic buildings. Siracusa is also a beautiful city, with its many Baroque churches and palaces.\nOne of the things that makes Ortigia and Siracusa so special is the way that people gather together to enjoy food, conversation, and the local culture. In the evenings, the streets of Ortigia are filled with people dining al fresco, drinking wine, and enjoying the company of friends and family. There is a real sense of community in Ortigia and Siracusa, and it is one of the things that makes these towns so special.\nChef Carmelo's Ortigia Cucina & Bar is inspired by the beauty and flavors of the small town and region of Sicily that he is from.\nOrtigia is a coastal town in Sicily, Italy, steeped in history and culture.
