Such requests inspired co-founders Merton “Andy” Anderson and Jim Mola to place an ad in The Wall Street Journal for prospective franchisees. Soon after, the first Village Inn franchise started operating in 1961, leading the way for successful franchise development.\nOur reputation for serving quality all-day breakfast endures and carries over to our lunch, dinner and our award-winning pies.  Village Inn serves some of the best pies in America – such as French Silk, Lemon Supreme, Country Apple and Caramel Pecan Silk Supreme.  We are proud of our tradition—and happy to be part of our guests’ daily lives.\nWith six decades of success, we have corporate and franchise restaurants totaling more than 100, located primarily in the Rocky Mountain region, the Midwest, Arizona and Florida.\nOur guests visit Village Inn because they know they will enjoy great-tasting food and extra-friendly service in a clean and comfortable family environment.  Many of our guests who visited our restaurants in their youth now take their children and grandchildren to Village Inn— when they’re hungry for life’s simple pleasures.\nCAREERS\n|\nABOUT\n|\nCONTACT\n|\nFUNDRAISING\n|\nGIFT CARDS\n|\nFRANCHISE\n|\nNUTRITION INFO\n© 2025 BBQ Holdings, Inc.\n|\nTerms of Use\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Info\n|\nOneTrust Cookies Settings link start\nCookies Settings\nOneTrust Cookies Settings link end\n|\nAccessibility Statement\n|\nGood Food\ngood feelings\nABOUT US\nIn 1958 the first Village Inn Pancake House opened its doors in Denver, Colorado and began offering what has since made us famous— made-from-scratch buttermilk pancakes, fresh eggs cooked any style, sizzling bacon and a pot of steaming hot coffee.\nMore than once, vacationers in Denver stopped at Village Inn for a bite to eat and enjoyed it so much that they inquired about franchise opportunities before leaving.
