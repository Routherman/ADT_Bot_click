The event successfully brought in artists with beautiful artwork to the streets of downtown Mount Dora, FL. Following this success, the citizen group committed to making the Mount Dora Arts Festival an annual event.\n-In 1984 many of the same citizens officially formed the Mount Dora Cultural Council. The Council’s stated goal was to celebrate the arts in Mount Dora and to promote and improve the quality of the Arts Festival. These endeavors were staffed by community volunteers and funded through membership dues and private contributions.\nOver the next ten years, the organization grew and expanded its programming to include art education. Thier aim was to enrich the community by offering opportunities for both children and adults to engage with the arts in meaningful ways besides the annual Arts Festival.\n-In 1985, the Mount Dora Cultural Council secured a lease in a two-story building located at 138 East 5th. in downtown Mount Dora, Fl.\n-In 1986 the Mount Dora Cultural Council Board of Trustees resolved to seek not for profit status as Mount Dora Center for the Arts (MDCA).\n-In 1995, MDCA purchased a two-story brick building at 138 East 5th Avenue where they offered art classes, gallery exhibitions and maintain administration offices for 25 years.\nThe building, built in 1923 had no elevator or handicap bathrooms. MDCA recognized the importance of having a facility more inclusive and accessible to all members of the community. Consequently, the board developed a strategic plan to address these challenges.\n-In 2022, MDCA sold the building.\n-In Feb 2024, proceeds from the sale were used to purchase an old gas station with high visibility and ample parking at 847 E. 5th Ave on the corner of 5th Ave and Highland St.\nCurrently being renovated to include accessible bathrooms, a modern gallery space and a flexible area suitable for meetings and visual and performing art workshops, this new, one-story building will create a new home for MDCA where art will be accessible to all.
