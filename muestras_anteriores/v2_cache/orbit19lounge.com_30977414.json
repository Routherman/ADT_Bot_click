Our mission is to give our guests an eclectic, hipster hangout, with a vibe of modern retro kitsch with NYC flair. There is no pretense here, just a warm and comfortable atmosphere, with a lounge area that includes a sofa, side tables, modern orbit chairs, as well as pool and foosball tables. Service at Orbit 19 is exceptional and personal with a staff that has remained intact since our inception. We serve only brand name spirits (250 types), including our premium rail selections, quality wines and fresh organic ingredients in cocktails, martinis, and shots. Nineteen beers (mostly craft) are available on tap, and we have over 75 bottled beers for your pleasure.\nAs one of the few underground establishments in the Tampa Bay Area, word of mouth is the primary source of our success for the last 11 1/2 years. Orbit 19 is a dynamic meeting spot for people-watching, conducting business, and/or chilling out.
