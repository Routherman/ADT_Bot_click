      "text": "Meet ELLEN\nDebra ELLEN Hartman, who goes by Ellen, always had a fascination with wine and the way in which it was created. Ellen was a vintner in the mid 90’s growing her own grapes and experimenting with different methods of making wine. She has traveled extensively in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, but especially in France, Italy and Germany. She has dined in some of the most prestigious restaurants in Europe…always sampling the wines of the region. In her grandfathers village In the mountains of Greece, she witnessed her relatives making their special wines. Ellen appreciates the knowledge and expertise that it takes to create that special bottle of wine.\nBe connected\nJoin Ellen’s Wine Room Newsletter\nfor Upcoming Events, Specials and Featured Wines\nEmail\n*\n.fl-post-content",
