      "text": "C Bar Ranch has a story that spans generations, with a rich history of turpentine production, cattle ranching and crops.  Now, with our luxury events barn built for the purpose, the ranch is the perfect venue for weddings and events in Florida.\nC Bar Ranch and Organics, LLC is a family-owned-and-operated farm and events venue. We are the fourth and fifth generation to work this land.\nMany years ago, the pine forests of the property were used for the collection of tree sap that was transformed by State Rep. Jasper Harris into turpentine for waterproofing ships.\nThe land was later farmed and ranched by his daughter, Dorothy, and her husband, Roy Cellon. They produced cattle and vegetables, often growing potatoes for what was then called the Wise Potato Chip Co.\nNow, ranch operations are run by their granddaughter, her husband, and their children. Their mission is to produce fresh, healthy vegetables and fruits in a variety of sustainable and eco-friendly ways and humanely raise animals the way God intended. They aim to preserve the ranch and its bountiful natural resources for many future generations to enjoy.\nIn 2017, the events venue was added to the property. Now, the family invites in others to enjoy a taste of rural life and all its beauty.\nRay Holt, the farm manager, would be proud to show you around and help you plan the perfect event.\nThe farm, with its sprawling oaks and charming barn, provides the perfect backdrop of natural beauty for a wide range of events—from elegant weddings to corporate events, quinceañeras, and much more.\nC Bar Ranch was named for the livestock brand of Roy and Dorothy Cellon, which appeared as a capital C with an underscore.\nWhy we do what we do\nRay and Nanette were married in 1997 and enjoyed their own wedding tremendously. Looking back on the day spent surrounded by loved ones gives them great joy even now. Their hope is to help you create memories that will bring you the same kind of joy as you launch your life together.\nBy building an elegant wedding and events venue, they’ve provided a way for the land to remain in an agricultural use and allow their adult children and future grandchildren to continue working together to  preserve the ranch.\nJoin the C Bar family\nWe look forward to hearing how we can help make your day just as you’ve dreamed it would be. Even better, actually! We take that responsibility very seriously. To us, our couples are family.\nWe strive to have unequaled customer service. If you have special requests, please let us know. We want to say yes!\nWe truly believe what our clients routinely say—that C Bar Ranch is the best Florida wedding venue and the best place to host special events.\nTo schedule a tour, call or text\n(904) 705-0780\ntoday or shoot an email to\nCBarRanchEvents@gmail.com\n.
