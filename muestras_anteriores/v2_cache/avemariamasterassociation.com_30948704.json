If a program is cancelled by the Master Association due to insufficient enrollment, all registrants will be notified in a timely manner, and the full cost of the program refunded.\n2.\nAlthough the Ave Maria Master Association generally adheres to a “No Refund” policy, refunds may be considered when extenuating circumstances exist and a written request is received at the Association office at least two days prior. For bus trips, a 30-day cancellation is required for a full refund, however, no refunds will be issued for ticketed items such as theater or sporting events.\n3.\nThe Ave Maria Master Association requires 72-hour cancellation notice for all Lifestyle Events. Due to space limitations for some events, adhering to this policy ensures your neighbors, who may be on a waiting list, can be notified that a spot has opened for them. If you need to cancel your reservation, please e-mail Ericka Sanchez at ericka.sanchez@fsresidential.com.\nModal content\nsecure sign information\n×\nModal content\n×\nok\nHome\n5080 Annunciation Circle #101 | Ave Maria, FL 34142\nDirect 239-867-4322 | Toll Free 800.870.0010\nEmail\nmaria.balderas@fsresidential.com\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nTerms of Service\n|\nRules and Regulations\n|\nSite Map\n|\nHomeowners association management software\nby\nFRONTSTEPS\n© 2000-\n2017\n.
