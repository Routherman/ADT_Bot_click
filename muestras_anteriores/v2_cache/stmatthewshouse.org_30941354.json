Together with our partners and participants, we cultivate communities where people are progressively seen, accepted, challenged, and supported.\nOur Guiding Principles\nCommunity Driven\nFor over 35 years, St. Matthew’s House\n®\nhas tackled challenges born from the needs of Southwest Florida.\nFaith Based\nSt. Matthew’s House\n®\nendeavors to follow Christ’s instructions outlined in Matthew 25.\nCrisis to Contributor\nOur programs meet immediate needs while building toward sustainable transformation.\nUniquely Funded\nWe don’t rely on government funding. Our social enterprise profits defray administrative costs, so donations reach those in need.\nOur story\nExplore our history\nJourney through milestones and meaningful moments over our last 35 years.\n1987\nSt. Matthew’s House began in 1987 when a group of local residents harnessed the power of the Naples Ministerial Association and formed the “Task Force for the Homeless”, which would eventually be renamed St. Matthew’s House. The group began gathering contributions of both food and clothing, establishing the mission’s food pantry.\n1989\nSt. Matthew’s House opened its doors in an old firehouse on Airport Road South. Serving three meals daily and offering eighteen beds, it became known as the “House with a Heart”.\n1994\nCommunity support grew and St. Matthew’s House was able to construct additional shelter capacity, more than tripling the beds available for men and also introducing sections for single women and for women with children and infants.\n2001\nResponding to additional community needs, St. Matthew’s House begins construction of Wolfe Apartments, to serve as affordable transitional housing, and opens Naples Thrift Store to further serve the community and provide an additional source of funding for the organization.\n2008\nSt. Matthew’s House merges with emergency housing shelter Immokalee Friendship House, expanding to include 44 additional beds, along with administrative efficiencies and more services to a larger segment of the population.\n2010\nWith the financial leadership of the Holecek Family Foundation, Justin’s Place Recovery Program opens in response to the need for long-term solutions for the struggles faced by the community’s most at-risk individuals.\n2017\nThe Wright Family partners to open Jill’s Place, the new home for the Jill Wright Retreat Center.\n2018\nWith the continued support of the Holecek Family Foundation, a 5-acre plot of land was purchased and named Justin’s Village in honor of Justin Holecek. The property serves as transitional housing for recovery program graduates and their families.\nAdditionally, the Naples Shelter is renamed Campbell Lodge in honor of the Campbell family and sets for extensive renovation.\n2020\nResponding to COVID-19, the St. Matthew’s House food pantry pivots to mobile food distributions and experiences exponential growth in order to meet growing needs.\nLuLu’s Kitchen is built and opens later in the year, made possible by the Holecek Family Foundation. LuLu’s Kitchen houses cafe, catering, and mission meal operations.\n2022\nIn response to Hurricane Ian’s devastating impact on southwest Florida, St. Matthew’s House donors, volunteers and staff came together to raise and deploy nearly $2.3 million in hurricane relief to repair damaged St. Matthew’s House facilities and help the community at large rebuild.\n2023\nLaunched the Scott & Dolly McCartan Empowerment Hub, a state-of-the-art learning facility designed to assist Justin’s Place alumni and program participants on their journey to financial stability.\n2024\nGroundbreaking of new Fort Myers Women and Children’s Shelter, expected to open later this year.\nFollow us on Social\nstmatthewshouse\nPartners\nGet involved\nTogether,  we can change lives.\nGet Help\nDonate\nFighting Hunger, Homelessness, Addiction, and Poverty for over 37 Years\nInstagram\nFacebook\nYoutube\nEnvelope\nPhone-alt\nAbout us\nAbout Us\nOur Team\nCareers\nTours\nFinancials\nEvents\nCapital Campaign\nAbout Us\nOur Team\nCareers\nTours\nFinancials\nEvents\nCapital Campaign\nOur Programs\nCrisis Response\nResidential Care\nCreating Contributors\nCrisis Response\nResidential Care\nCreating Contributors\nWays To Support\nDonate Financially\nDonate Goods\nVolunteer\nShop & Dine\nChristmas Market\nDonate Financially\nDonate Goods\nVolunteer\nShop & Dine\nChristmas Market\nGet help\nFood\nShelter\nAddiction Recovery\nJob Skills & Training\nFood\nShelter\nAddiction Recovery\nJob Skills & Training\nContact us\n239-774-0500\n[email protected]\nCollier County\n2001 Airport Road S.\nNaples, FL 34112\nLee County\n2031 Jackson St. Suite 140\nFort Myers, FL 33901\nCopyright © St. Matthew’s House 1987-2024.
