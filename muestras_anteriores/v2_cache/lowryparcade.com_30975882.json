      "text": "Open since early 2016, Lowry Parcade is Tampa’s first arcade and craft beer bar dedicated to providing the best in classic arcades, craft beer, and awesome events.\nAmazing beer selection (and wine, too!)\nOur passion for quality craft beer is matched with our love of old school games. Florida has an amazing range of breweries that we love to feature, so our beer menu focuses first on local breweries with their vast mix of styles.\nBeyond Florida, we constantly rotate our other draft lines with selections from all over the nation and beyond. We also have tons of bottles and cans always on-hand, and a variety of wine styles if you prefer something from the vine.\nClassic Arcade, Pinball, and More!\nOur arcade is full of old school, nostalgic games such as Galaga, Ms. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, X-Men, and many others\n(\nsee the full list here!\n)\n. Games are 1-4 tokens per play.\nWe sell Tokens here, and the more you spend on Tokens, the more free ones you’ll get!\nWe continually rotate our Pinball Machines\n(\nfull list here!\n)\n. We also have Skee-Ball, Air Hockey, Bubble Hockey, and more uncommon games.\nIf you have an arcade or pinball machine for sale, or if you’d like to request a machine, please contact us!\nWe’re friendly to all members of the family!\nUntil 9 PM, we welcome gamers of all ages! Kids are cool, but they have to stay with parents at all times. Please ensure that they respect the machines\n(most are 20-30 years old)\n, so encourage hugs instead of kicks.\nWe are 21+ after 9 PM, so adult swim rules apply: No kids after that point\nWe’re also dog friendly!\nWe love puppers! (Please keep them on a leash and close to you though, or we may keep them.)\nWe have events every week!\nDaily Events and Specials\nUnlimited Credits Mondays\n– $8 for a wrist band, all machines on Free Play\nTacos & Trivia Tuesdays\n– Every Tuesday at 7:30 PM\nToken Thursdays\n– Free tokens with every drink purchase\nHigh Score Challenge\n– Beat one of our high scores, win a prize\nToken Beers –\nGet free tokens when ordering select drinks\nMonthly Happenings\nSpecialty beer tappings\nand events such as “\nBattle The Brewery\n” happen\nonce a month\n. Beat the brewery reps to win swag and free beer! Good times.\nLocal bands and DJs\ncome to perform regularly!\nArt shows\nNerdy Burlesque\n(that we creatively call … “Nerdlesque”) hits the stage on select nights!\nAnd there are many, many more shows and things to do!\nCheck our\ncalendar\nand\nFacebook page\nfor upcoming events.\nIf you haven’t been by yet, we hope you decide to check us out soon! We work hard to have a friendly and comfortable environment for all to enjoy. For our visitors, both newbie and regular alike, THANK YOU SO MUCH for your support and love.\nCheers,\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Parcade\n/leaf_row",
