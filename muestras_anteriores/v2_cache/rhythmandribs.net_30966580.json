Today we are 66 leaders within our professions and our community, who get together once a week for fellowship and an opportunity to give back to our community and the world.\nRhythm & Ribs is an all-volunteer effort of many more people than just our club members. Over 340 volunteers put in over 2,000 hours to run the festival for three days. Additionally, thousands of hours are spent planning the festival throughout each year.\nAll the members of the St. Augustine Sunrise Rotary Club volunteer most of their weekend alongside their many friends and supporters of Rhythm & Ribs.\nHistory of the Festival\nRhythm & Ribs was founded by St. Augustine Sunrise Rotary in 1995 as an event from which all proceeds are donated to charitable organizations for local and international service-oriented projects, as well as providing a fun-filled weekend for the whole community.\nWhat began as a small Barbeque Fest (its original name) has grown each year and attracts music lovers and barbeque aficionados from all over the Southeast and beyond. People of all ages come to enjoy the fun over the Festival weekend.\nAs the Festival has grown, the music lineup has expanded to include headliners such as JJ Grey & MOFRO, Sister Hazel, Rusted Root, Leon Russell, Dave Mason, and the Marshall Tucker Band, along with many well-loved local and regional musicians.\nclose #content-container-pro\nclose .width-container\nclose #main\nHosted & Operated by the St. Augustine Sunrise Rotary and funded by our Sponsors & Festival Guests\n© 2021 All Rights Reserved.
