He later studied culinary at NECI and completed an internship in Nantucket, MA. Working in Nantucket at American Seasons,\nEthan was largely influenced and mentored by Chef Mike Lascola. He has been invited several times to the prestigious James Beard House to express his culinary skills with Chef Mike. He continued work for his mom in the off-season from Nantucket, but eventually decided to stay home to help with the family business and his pop for his final years.\nBus Boy Blair Hensley\nBlair graduated from the University of West Alabama with a degree in Sports Medicine. During college, Blair had the opportunity to work for Ironman Triathlons traveling the country as the Logistics Coordinator. Later, he moved back home to help with the family businesses.\nIt wasn’t long before he acquired his first Hotdog Stand, Coney Island Drive-Inn, where he put his heart and soul into bringing the Brooksville staple back to life. After 8 years, he sold Coney Island and bought an old restaurant near downtown Brooksville, Farmer John’s. This finally allowed Blair and Ethan the opportunity to bring their dream restaurant to fruition and the “upside-down boot” that Blair had drawn on a napkin years ago was brought to life. In 2012 they opened the doors to Florida Cracker Kitchen and our brand has been growing ever since.\nFlorida Cracker Trading Company\nA little taste of what we're all about here at Florida Cracker!\nQUICK LINKS:\nHome\nEat & Drink\nEvents\nAbout\nDestinations\nReal Estate\nCatering\nMenus\nMISC LINKS:\nOnline Ordering\nOnline Store\nDealer Login\nJoin Our Team\nContact\nFAQs\nPrivacy\nSitemap\nManager Portal\nMAIN ADDRESS:\n966 E Jefferson St, Brooksville, FL 34601",
