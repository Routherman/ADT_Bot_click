      "text": "PRESENTING\nWhen All The Saints Are Gathered\nOctober 11, 2025 to\nOctober 12, 2025\nSet in St. Augustine, Florida, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, this play follows the journey of five students eager to contribute to the fight for justice. While the national movement is often defined by figures like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy, this story focuses on those who were the boots on the ground—leaders like Dr. Robert Hayling, who risked everything for the cause. Through the students’ eyes, we witness their training, their fears, and their triumphs as they prepare for sit-ins, marches, and wade-ins, facing violent backlash at every turn. The play highlights pivotal historical moments, such as the loss of the NAACP charter, the Klan’s attack on Dr. Hayling’s home, and the attempted assassination inside his dental office. The arrival of Dr. King further shifts the movement’s momentum, but the play does not shy away from showing how local leaders like Hayling sacrificed their safety and livelihoods for the movement. Each student, guided by Hayling’s mantra, “Never give up,” takes a different path. Their journey will challenge the audience to examine what it truly means never to give up.\nBuy Tickets\nSee Details\nPRESENTING\nBen Sollee - A Black Box Session at Limelight Theatre (Presented by St. Augustine Amphitheatre)\nOctober 21, 2025 to\nOctober 21, 2025\nKentucky musician and composer Ben Sollee has been blurring boundaries with his musical style and career for nearly\ntwo decades – his latest album, Long Haul (2024) is no exception. Drawing on tonal influences from the American and global south, Sollee’s vocals and unique cello style thread through each track binding seemingly disparate chapters of his journey – the Long Haul.  After his last album in 2017, Sollee took a break from touring to grow his family and deepen community connections in Louisville, KY. Now a father of three, Sollee has leaned into his work as a composer; scoring films such as LAND from\ndirector Robin Wright, and Maggie Morre(s), a John Slattery film featuring Tina Fey and Jon Hamm. He also scored t\nhe\npodcast series Unreformed, which was recently nominated for a Peabody Award. Outside of music, Sollee helped launch\nthe non-profit Canopy, which supports Kentucky businesses positively impacting their communities and planet.\nBuy Tickets\nSee Details",
