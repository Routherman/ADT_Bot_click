Staying connected with our community of plant lovers, sharing a passion\n               for nature, and participating in  initiatives to protect and preserve our precious\n               botanical heritage.\nWe invite you to embark on a journey of discovery and inspiration at the Botanical\n               Gardens at the University of South Florida. Come explore, learn, and connect with\n               the wonders of the plant world through our website. Welcome to a world of botanical\n               beauty and knowledge!\nHISTORY OF THE USF BOTANICAL GARDENS\nYesterday\nWhen the USF Botanical Gardens was established in 1969, the Gardens were little more\n               than disturbed woodlands, Lake Behnke was essentially a marshy wetland, Fowler Avenue\n               was a two-lane road and the surrounding commercial development did not exist. There\n               were few mature trees and very few people knew this small jewel existed. During the\n               1970’s and 1980’s, the Gardens served primarily as a teaching and research facility\n               for the Biology Department at the University and its function as a public garden was\n               non-existent.\nNearly all of the mature trees now found at the Gardens were planted in the early\n               1970’s.  Most of the tropical palms and flowering trees froze in 1977 and again in\n               1983, but the natives escaped unscathed.  Replanting of the tropicals and the addition\n               of other natives has been an ongoing process since the beginning.  Our structures\n               also came about in the 1970’s. The greenhouses were moved from a nearby police station\n               to their present location on-site, and the gardens were enclosed by fencing. A concrete\n               block building was created to serve as a potting shed and storage structure.\nToday\nThe Gardens experienced tremendous growth beginning in the 1990s when it was opened\n               to the public. The addition of new structures, demonstration gardens and plant collections\n               began in earnest.  Volunteer and membership programs were established as well as the\n               semi-annual plant festivals. These efforts were quite successful, providing funds\n               to hire part-time staff and make improvements to the Gardens' facilities.\nEumaeus atala\nbutterfly\nThe Plant Shop was established in 1994, increasing the visibility of the Gardens and\n               this served to attract many new members and visitors as well as additional funds for\n               the Gardens' development.  Plant festivals, Plant Shop sales, and memberships and\n               donations became an important source of revenue.\nNew visitors from around the world discover the USF Botanical Gardens daily and we\n               have become an important outreach component of USF. What began as a very modest exercise\n               in 1959 has grown into something quite substantial.\nUniversity of South Florida\nMenu\nAbout USF\nAcademics\nAdmissions\nLocations\nCampus Life\nResearch\nAdministrative Units\nRegulations & Policies\nHuman Resources\nWork at USF\nEmergency & Safety\nTitle IX\nUSF Health\nUSF Athletics\nUSF Alumni\nSupport USF\nUSF Libraries\nUSF World\n4202 E.
