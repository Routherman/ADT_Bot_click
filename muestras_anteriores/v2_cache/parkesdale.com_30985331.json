      "text": "About Us\nThe legacy that is now known as Parkesdale Farms began when company founder R.E. (Roy) Parke, Jr. emigrated from Northern Ireland to Pennsylvania in 1924 with his family. Roy’s father continued to pursue a vocation in farming after arriving in America with his family. In 1956, the family relocated to Plant City, FL, which was recognized throughout the country as the prime location for growing winter vegetables and strawberries. Thus the first 10 acres of Parkesdale strawberry crops had been planted!\nOver the years, Roy and his own family took on the farm with a zest for hard work and a keen knowledge of agricultural and business practices. They expanded the farm into hundreds of acres of the finest strawberries, citrus, and vegetables available anywhere in the country. Parkesdale also added their own plant nurseries, which hold four extensive greenhouses, where they produce over a million vegetables and flowering plants annually we ship nationwide.\nIn February 1969 Roy’s daughter Cheryl and her husband Jim Meeks opened this beloved Parkesdale Farm Market. What began as a small farm market has continued to grow and expand into the largest Strawberry, Citrus, and Produce Market in Florida! In September 2007, Cheryl and Jim's son, Jim Meeks and wife Xiomara Meeks, joined the Market to continue Roy's legacy.\nFruit / Groves\nFor three generations our family has been committed to growing and gifting only the most choice selection of fresh citrus, strawberries, plants, seasonings and produce. Through a combination of exceptional climate, enriched soil conditions, warm Florida sunshine, hard work and proprietary crop growing approach, Parkesdale is able to offer you the high quality you've come to associate with Parkesdale Market and probably the reason our gourmet products ship all across the USA and sell out quickly.\nGift Shop / Retail / Market\nSet in the heart of scenic Plant City, Florida (exit #17 from I-4) a quick 30 minute drive from Tampa and 60 minutes from Orlando,  Parkesdale Market draws quite a crowd November through April in prime picking (and strawberry shortcake) season but even off season their milkshakes bring all the families to the yard (or maybe its their plant nursery, seasonings, gourmet jellies and jams and the crowd favorite, 7 keys coconut toast spread)....We personally invite you to come see our Market and Gift Shop bursting with produce, citrus, and (of course!) strawberries in our beautiful locale set amongst tropical gardens and lavish foliage. Before sending your gift baskets come see them in person for help in selecting the perfect assortment.\nCustomers\nMany of our customers come from right here in Plant City and the surrounding areas, who wish to buy fresh produce that the local supermarket simply can’t compete with in price or freshness. Not surprisingly, though, a large portion of our clientele spans the country from families to corporate businesses. Through compliments and positive reviews from our customers, the word has spread that Parkesdale Farms offers produce and customer service that is unsurpassed.\nMarket Hours\nmid April to October:\nOpen Wednesday to Sunday 9 am to 6 pm.\nClosed Monday and Tuesday.\nNovember to early April:\nOpen every day Monday to Sunday 9 am to 6 pm.\nClosed on the following Holidays:\nNew Year's Day (Jan 1),  Easter (Sunday), Mother's Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day, 4th of July, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\nSummer Vacation:\nClosed July 20, 2025 to August 12, 2025.\nSpecial Hours on New Year's Eve:\n9 am to 2 pm\nFriendly Reminder: We love our furry friends too, but please remember that our space is reserved for service animals only\n.\nYour cooperation helps ensure a comfortable and safe environment for everyone.
