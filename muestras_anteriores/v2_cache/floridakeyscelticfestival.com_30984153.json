      "text": "Live Music\nAlbannach\nAlbannach primarily hails from Scotland’s industrial heartland of Glasgow. With one bagpiper, three drummers, and a didgeridoo, they create unrivaled sounds that echo from the ancient glens of Alba (ancient name of Scotland). Their primal Pipe and Drum carry the very essence of what it is to be Scottish in every note: Passion, Power and Pride. Performing worldwide since 2005 with six albums, two DVDs and countless awards to their name, this musical War-Hammer shows no signs of slowing down as they continue to pound out the live shows with their raw energy and captivating performance as they have done in thousands of shows over the years.\nThe Screaming Orphans\nThe Screaming Orphans are a high-energy band of four sisters from County Donegal, Ireland. With deep roots in traditional Irish music, the Screaming Orphans draw on a diverse set of influences ranging from The Bangles to The McNulty Family, with a strong focus on melody-driven songs with pop and rock strains.\nPiper Jones Band\nThe Piper Jones Band has one mission: to bring spirited, magical dance tunes and songs to everyone - from Celtic music veterans to those hearing it for the first time. The Piper Jones Band is a lyrical, high energy trio based on the moving & beautiful sounds of the Highland bagpipes, accompanied by unique percussive chords from the bouzouki and inspired drums. While maintaining a strong musical base in traditional tunes from Ireland, Scotland, and Appalachia, the group also performs original instrumental compositions & powerful vocal harmonies, as well as stepping off stage from time to time to lead the audience in traditional Celtic dances.\nSean Heely Celtic Band\nThe band’s performances are woven with engaging historical narratives, creating a deep connection to the traditions they celebrate. Featuring powerful vocal harmonies and an ever-growing repertoire, their songs include Scots Gaelic (Gàidhlig) ballads, sea shanties, pub songs, and more—bringing the timeless spirit of Celtic folk music to life. Led by U.S National Scottish Fiddle and Gàidhlig singing champion Seán Heely, acclaimed multi-instrumentalist & All-Ireland singing champion Kevin Elam, bouzouki & bass player Beth Patterson, acclaimed percussionist Lucas Ashby, piper Jesse Ofgang, champion fiddler Colin McGlynn, percussive dancer Agi Kovacs, harpist Abbie Palmer. They have performed in venues such as the Kennedy Center, Strathmore Music center, Hylton Performing Arts Center, headliners at Grandfather Mountain Highland Games since 2023, Virginia Scottish games, and the Niel Gow Festival in Scotland.\nPolice Pipe and Drum Corps of Florida\nThe Fraternal Order of Police, District Five -- was founded in 1990. Based in Fort Lauderdale, the band and color guard are presently comprised of 51 serving and retired police officers, fire fighters, and civilians, all of whom are volunteers. They are a 501(c)(3) organization who, in addition to their soul-stirring performances, sponsor and organize charitable endeavors throughout South Florida and the Florida Keys.\nLive Music\nAlbannach\nAlbannach primarily hails from Scotland’s industrial heartland of Glasgow.
