      "text": "About the Course\nFor over 80 years, Mark Bostick Golf Course has anchored the northwest corner of the University of Florida’s Gainesville campus. Although the course was originally designed by renowned architect Donald Ross during the 1920s, it has evolved over the years to take on its own distinct personality.\nContained within a 116-acre plot of land, the 6,701-yard, par-70 course is short by today’s golf standards. However, a $4 million renovation project in 2001 by Jacksonville-based architect Bobby Weed transformed the contour of the landscape, creating a course that is both physically and mentally challenging.\nBeginning in 1962, the Mark Bostick Golf Course (formerly the Gainesville Golf and Country Club) has shared a special relationship with the UF golf teams. The course has been home to the Gators’ day-to-day operations through six NCAA championships (four men’s and two women’s) and 21 Southeastern Conference (13 men’s, eight women’s) titles since 1962. Several prominent golfers have called Mark Bostick Golf Course their home, including Chris DiMarco, Mark Calcavecchia, Sandra Gal, Lori Garbacz, Dudley Hart, Bob Murphy, Andy North, Deb Richard, Laurie Rinker-Graham, Camilo Villegas, Donna (Horton) White), Billy Horschel and Matt Every.\nEach year, MBGC plays host to several championship tournaments. Included among these are the Gator Invitational, the Gator Women’s Golf Invitational and the Gator Golf Day, where alumni and current PGA Tour players return each year to support the winning tradition of Florida golf.\nCourse Rules\nRules of the United States Golf Association will govern all play except where modified by day to day local rules.\nUSGA Rules of Golf\nMore\nReclaimed Water is used on course.\nOwned and operated by The University Athletic Association, Inc.",
