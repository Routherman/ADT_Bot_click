Fairchild volunteers have been an integral part of the Garden’s history and contribute to every aspect of our operations.\nVolunteers learn new skills, make a positive impact in the community and the world, and advance Fairchild’s mission through their hands-on support of our programs. Fairchild volunteers have access to a wide range of classes and training opportunities.\nAll active Fairchild volunteers who give a minimum of 30 hours of service a year automatically become part of the Friends of Fairchild, which hosts lectures, field trips, and social activities.\nVolunteer Requirements\nMost adult volunteer opportunities require a commitment of 3-4 hours per week for a minimum of three months. These are typically done with one shift per week on the same day, although some areas are more flexible than others.\nFor short term opportunities, we offer Special Events positions, and these do not require the same weekly/monthly commitment. These are open to students. Our minimum age is 14.\nAll year-round Fairchild Volunteers are required to participate in Core Class Training as well as additional training for specific volunteer areas.\nVolunteer Information Sessions\nVolunteer Information Events are held throughout the year to inform Fairchild members and the public about available opportunities and requirements.

In certain program areas, a second placement interview is required. The types and numbers of openings vary considerably throughout the year.\nUpcoming Information Sessions:\nGeneral Volunteer Recruitment:\nOctober 4th, 2025 @ 11am\nPlease contact\nvolunteer@fairchildgarden.org\nto RSVP!\nGroup/Corporate Volunteer Days\nGroup Volunteer Days are a way for volunteers to try their hand with horticulture and contribute to beautifying the Garden! This is the perfect project for a community group or a corporate team building project! Projects can vary and can include weeding, trimming, pruning, major plant removal, plant relocation, and more. These sessions are open to community groups or individuals. We set a limit of 20, if your group is larger, please contact us to discuss. Minimum age is 14, or 12 with a parent/guardian accompanying.\nUsually hosted from 9AM-12PM but can be flexible.\nPlease contact\nvolunteer@fairchildgarden.org\nto register.\nWhere You Can Volunteer\nAdult Volunteers:\nVolunteer positions vary throughout the year!
