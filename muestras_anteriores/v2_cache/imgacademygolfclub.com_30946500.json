Baseball became his main sport the first year of high school where played 3 years of Varsity. He played Division 1 baseball at Western Carolina University and studied biology. The New York Yankees organization drafted him in 2007, and Steve played professionally for 3 years before a shoulder injury forced an early retirement.\nAfter a father son trip to Ireland, he returned to golf with a renewed passion for the game. Steve attended and graduated from Professional Golfers Career College with an associate’s degree in Golf Course Management. At The Golf College, he fell in love with instructing, growing the game of golf, as well as tournament operations. Steve has been at IMG for 12 years working from PGA associate to now a Member of PGA of America.\nSteve’s full swing Teaching Philosophy gets students envisioning the golf swing as an athletic movement executed by their natural ability. He believes everyone’s swing is unique, and there is more than one way to swing a golf club successfully. His goal is to unite his student’s unique characteristics with simple fundamentals, thus creating a sound, effortless, repeatable golf swing. Steve’s short game philosophy creates standard short game swing using full swing techniques. By making small simple adjustments at setup, you can create a variety of shots only limited by the golfer’s imagination. Steve’s putting philosophy simplifies the mechanics of putting into two major strokes. Matching the setup and the stroke makes putting easier and fun to practice.\n[email protected]\nJason Uibel – Assistant Golf Professional\nGrowing up in South Jersey, Jason grew up as an all-around athlete playing Ice hockey, Baseball, Golf, Lacrosse, and Snowboarding. After an ACL tear in 2018 Jason turned his attention to golf and working in the golf industry. Jason attended Keiser University’s College of Golf and Graduated in May of 2021. While at Keiser Jason was a part of Keiser’s Men’s Lacrosse team and Club Golf team.\nAfter graduating, Jason headed to Telluride Colorado to work at Telluride Golf and Ski Club. There he worked under teaching pro Mike Dero who helped him with continuing his learning of teaching fundamentals. After a summer in the mountains, he came back to Florida, where he would spend the next 3 winter seasons working at some of the top private golf clubs in Palm Beach County, while spending the summer months at clubs up north in the Greater Philadelphia area.  The last few years Jason has made starts on the Minor League Golf Tour and captured his first ever 1st Place finish this past summer. He also competed in the US Open Local qualifying this past May and looks to try and compete again this upcoming year.\nJason’s teaching philosophies focus on course management, swing mechanics as well as maintaining a healthy body to increase longevity.  Good course Management plays a key role in lowering golf scores as knowing how to play holes and where to place shots is key. And with a passion for fitness, Jason likes to focus on maintaining strength and mobility as both are essential to hitting the ball straighter and longer, as well as playing pain free golf. Jason is looking forward to working with all the members here at IMG Academy Golf Club and helping make the world a better place one swing at a time.\n[email protected]\nRenze Berg – Golf Course Superintendent\nRenze Berg has been here at IMG Golf Club since February 21st, 2022.  Prior to accepting this position, he was Golf Course Superintendent at River Strand Golf and Country Club from October 2015-February 2022.  Before that, he was Golf Course Superintendent at Bradenton Country Club from May 1998-Oct 2015.  Renze Graduated from Lake City Community College in 1996 with an A.S.
