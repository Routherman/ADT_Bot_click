When we were searching for a name for our first Irish Sports Pub, we decided to name it after a much admired family hero from the past, a man by the name of Johnny Malloy. Johnny Malloy grew up in the early 1920’s in Cleveland, Ohio, in a tough area populated by Irish immigrants. Like many young Irish lads, he dreamed of becoming a policeman.\nHe not only achieved his dream, he was assigned to the Mounted Division. A bit of Irish luck, since Johnny also loved horses. It was a perfect match.\nJohnny Malloy and his horse, Sonny, were loved by all who knew them (even the badguys). He was always friendly and ready to lend a helping hand. One of Johnny’s most enjoyable duties was riding in the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade, carrying the “Stars and Stripes”.\nJohnny would have loved it – an Irish pub named after himself – the relatives back in County Mayo, Ireland would sure be proud.\nEnd Section 2\nStart Section 3\nContact us:\nby phone\n(239)-992-5000,\nby email\nmalloysjohnny@yahoo.com\nEnd Section 3\nStart Section 1\nJohnny Malloy's\nDot slide navigation number 1\nDot slide navigation number 2\nslideshow start stop playing\nJohnny Malloy's\nEnd Section 1\nStart Section 2\nAbout us\nThe pride of the Cleveland Mounted Police.
