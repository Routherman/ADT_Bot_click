Once an hour is used, it may replaced by another reservation. This only limits the number of reservations that can held at any one time. This system ensures bookings are fair and equitable while preventing the possibility of monopolising the finite resource of available reservations.\nCorporate Memberships\nAnd Events\nCorporate memberships and events are available. Please contact us for more information.\nContact us\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo I have to sign a contract when I join?\nNo. You are free to cancel your membership at anytime for any reason. You will have access for the remainder of your pre-paid membership term, but you will not be renewed or charged again.\nCancelations MUST be made in writing by emailing support@athleticmotiongolf.com.\nIf I need to cancel, do you offer refunds?\nYes. The refund policies for each membership level are as follows:\nBASE Membership: you may receive a refund for the balance in your member account.\nCLUB Membership: you may receive a refund for any unused months remaining on your annual plan. You will not receive a refund for current or past months based on your plan start date.\nTOUR Membership: you may receive a refund for any unused months remaining on your annual plan. You will not receive a refund for current or past months based on your plan start date.\nCan I change memberships if I want to?\nOf course. We can change your membership at the front desk for you, or you can login to the website (and app) and make the changes at anytime.\nDo I need to be TOUR Member to get lessons from Mike and Shaun?\nNo. Although membership perks offer huge savings, you will always be able to book lessons, clinics, AMGÂ schools, and events. You can book them all from your phone or computer once logged into your account.\nCan I book lessons, clinics, schools and fittings if I'm not a member?\nYes. You'll just need to create an account on the website or app. Once you have an account set up, you'll be able to book any of our services a la carte.\nCan I bring family members?\nYes. Immediate family members (spouse and children living at home) are included in the TOURÂ Membership. CLUB Members can add family members to their membership for a small charge. BASE members can pay for additional members when they visit as well.\nCan I stay longer than 1-2 hrs at the BASE/CLUB member levels?  What If I want to stay longer?\nWe want to make sure all members get the experience they expect. To respect all members, we have 2 hr limits on hitting bay reservations for BASE/CLUB members. If you've made a reservation during a slow period, and there are no reservations scheduled after you, you are welcome to continue playing. Keep in mind that the AMGC experience is not like a driving range, this is like working on your game in a microwave. If you're practicing the right way, with all the feedback available, practicing longer than 2 hrs can often be detrimental.\nStill have questions?\nLet us know how we can help.\nContact us\n1230 Winter Garden Vineland Rd, Suite 108\nWinter Garden, FL 34787\nHome\nLogin\nContact Us\nConsult your doctor prior to any training within our products, videos, or website.
