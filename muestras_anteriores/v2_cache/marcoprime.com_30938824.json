Known for his creative interpretations and dedication to authenticity and quality, Chef Rocha's return to Marco Prime heralds a new chapter in the restaurant's culinary narrative. His commitment to sourcing the finest ingredients, combined with a deep understanding of Peruvian cooking techniques, promises an elevated dining experience for patrons seeking a fusion of tradition and innovation on their plates.\nHis cullinary journey started at the age of 25 when he immersed himself in learning everything he could about cuisine and preparations; reading books and finding recipes online. Chef Roberto started working with the Carvelli Restaurant Group in 2007 where he studied under Chef Francesco Carvelli. This experience allowed him to practice what he was reading in the kitchen, and the Carvelli Resturant Group pushed him to become a better chef by enabling him to take classes and receive formal training. His dedication and talent earned him a prominent role at Tanta, a celebrated Peruvian restaurant in Chicago, where he honed his skills under the tutelage of renowned chefs, mastering the artistry of fine dining.\nAs Executive Chef at Marco Prime, Chef Roberto Rocha's return signifies an exciting new era, where his culinary mastery promises to tantalize taste buds and create memorable dining experiences for patrons seeking a harmonious blend of sophistication and authenticity in every dish. Marco Prime is consistently voted one of the best restaurants in Marco Island.\nWhat our patrons have to say\nWhat our patrons\nhave to say\n<img src=\"https://marcoprime.com/wp-content/plugins/reviews-feed-pro/vendor/smashballoon/customizer/sb-common/sb-customizer/assets/images/avatar.jpg\"  />\nEd W.\n2 year ago\nDown in Marco for the week and couldn't wait to dine at MP for our anniversary. When I started reading recent reviews, I got a little nervous thinking maybe it had gone downhill since last visit 5 years ago. What are people talking about??  We were not at all disappointed. We started with the delicious wagyu meatballs paired with a Riesling and Pinot Noir. Bread was great and had a tasty butter with it.  My wife and daughter ordered the petit filets and both said it was the best steaks they ever had in their lives. Both finished every bite and I took down a 20oz boneless ribeye. I like my creamed spinach a little more creamed, but it was still good.  Also had some truffle fries on the side. Server (Eastern European accent) was fantastic but I didn't catch his name.\nFirst Friday of Lent  (oops).\n...\n<img src=\"https://marcoprime.com/wp-content/uploads/sbr-feed-images/google-1695574217ChIJ1fdj2fu2ogR2hUjUCFWCEUOscarRojas-avatar-150.png\"  />\nOscar Rojas\n2 year ago\nMarco Steak House deserves its excellent reputation for fine dining and special occasions. My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary there last night, and everything was perfect. The food is delectable, earning a solid 4 stars. We shared a Sliced 14oz Wagyu N.y. Strip Steak  which was cooked to tender perfection and bursting with flavor.\nBut where Marco's really shines is the service and ambiance, both of which merit a perfect 5 stars. Our server Leo could not have been more attentive. He knew it was our anniversary and went above and beyond to make it special, surprising us with a decadent chocolate dessert on the house. What amazing attention to detail! The atmosphere is elegant and romantic, with soft lighting, white tablecloths, and fresh flowers on every table.\nFor a memorable dining experience in a classy yet comfortable environment, Marco's Steak House is a fantastic choice. We will certainly be returning to celebrate future anniversaries. Thanks Marco's for helping make our special evening so delightful!\n...\n<img src=\"https://marcoprime.com/wp-content/uploads/sbr-feed-images/yelp-Ak7667pcW7OLPmXww4KyKw-avatar-150.png\"  />\nOscar R.\n2 year ago\nMarco Steak House deserves its excellent reputation for fine dining and special occasions.
