      "text": ".et_pb_section\n.et_pb_column\nWelcome to Francis Wilson Playhouse!\nNow in our 96th Season in Clearwater!\nYou may have be wondering who was Francis Wilson and why does our Playhouse bear his name?\nIf you had lived in the small town of Clearwater between 1905 and 1935, you might have seen him about town – he was short man with a jaunty step, a ready smile, expressive eyes and often wore a straw hat.\nIt was during this time that Francis Wilson was well known as a celebrity on Broadway. He had the urge to entertain, had a preference for comedy – as most of us do – and having begun his career in Philadelphia as an entertainer back in the middle 1800′s, his experience on the stage was extensive. With all his seventy one years of promoting quality stage performances, Francis Wilson’s greatest contribution to theatre took place in 1935 in Clearwater on the bay – THE FRANCIS WILSON PLAYHOUSE. And then with great civic pride, the Playhouse had its opening night on January 7, 1935.\nhttps://medicamentimpuissance.com/prix-generique-viagra-en-ligne-sans-encombre/\nhttps://medicamentserection.com/generique-viagra/\n.et_pb_text\n.et_pb_column\n.et_pb_row\nHigh Quality Entertainment\nFor nearly 100 years, Francis Wilson Playhouse has been the premier venue for amazing Broadway-style productions, featuring some of the best talent in the Tampa Bay Area.\n.et_pb_text\n.et_pb_column\nIncluding the Community\nAll of our actors, technicians, backstage crew members are volunteers!
