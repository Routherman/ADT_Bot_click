Joining them by bringing his business experience, their friend Rian, helped turn the project into a reality. Combining their love for pups, people, and a good brew, they embarked on a new adventure: opening “Barks and Brews”. Pat, Chris and Rian are excited to create a welcoming space where dog owners can unwind with a cold beer while their furry friends socialize and make new tail-wagging buddies.
