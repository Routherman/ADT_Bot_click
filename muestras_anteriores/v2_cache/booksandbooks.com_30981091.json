Fast forward to 2022 and more than 700 virtual events under our belt, now archived for your viewing pleasure. Scroll through some of these recordings and you’ll find more than 2 years’ worth of fascinating conversations in support of many of the important books published during a truly historic and unprecedented time.\nFollow us on Crowdcast\nand be the first to know of new events and pairings.

With a thriving cooking business, full schedule of volunteer work, and a beautiful home in the Philadelphia suburbs, she should be content. But her teenage daughter can be a handful, her husband can be distant, her work can feel trivial, and she has lots of acquaintances, but no real friends. Still, Daisy knows she’s got it good. So why is she up all night?\nWhile Daisy tries to identify the root of her dissatisfaction, she’s also receiving misdirected emails meant for a woman named Diana Starling, whose email address is just one punctuation mark away from her own. While Daisy’s driving carpools, Diana is chairing meetings. While Daisy’s making dinner, Diana’s making plans to reorganize corporations. Diana’s glamorous, sophisticated, single-lady life is miles away from Daisy’s simpler existence. When an apology leads to an invitation, the two women meet and become friends. But, as they get closer, we learn that their connection was not completely accidental. Who IS this other woman, and what does she want with Daisy?\nFrom the manicured Main Line of Philadelphia to the wild landscape of the Outer Cape, written with Jennifer Weiner’s signature wit and sharp observations, That Summer is a story about surviving our pasts, confronting our futures, and the sustaining bonds of friendship.\nAbout the Author:\nJENNIFER WEINER is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of eighteen books, including Good in Bed, That Summer, and an essay collection, Hungry Heart: Adventures in Life, Love, and Writing. A graduate of Princeton University and contributor to the New York Times Opinion section, Jennifer lives with her family in Philadelphia. Visit her online at JenniferWeiner.com.\nAbout the Moderator:\nKATIE KEMPNER is the creator and host of “Perspectives with Katie Kempner”, a long running series of conversations with remarkable working women balancing busy lives. Perspectives can be found as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Google Play and as a limited video series on Amazon Prime.\nKatie is also the founder of Kempner Communications, a high-end business communications consultancy based in Miami, Los Angeles and NYC. She is the very proud mother of a son and daughter and lives in Miami Beach with her husband and two dogs.\nAddThis Advanced Settings above via filter on the_content\nAddThis Advanced Settings below via filter on the_content\nAddThis Advanced Settings generic via filter on the_content\nAddThis Share Buttons above via filter on the_content\nAddThis Share Buttons below via filter on the_content\nAddThis Share Buttons generic via filter on the_content\n#post-x\nEvent footer\nNavigation\nEvent Navigation\n«\nPeople We Meet On Vacation: An Evening with Emily Henry and Evie Dunmore\nSqueeze Me: An Evening with Carl Hiaasen and Dave Barry\n»\n.tribe-events-sub-nav\n#tribe-events-footer\n#tribe-events-content\nThis calendar is powered by The Events Calendar.\nhttp://evnt.is/18wn",
