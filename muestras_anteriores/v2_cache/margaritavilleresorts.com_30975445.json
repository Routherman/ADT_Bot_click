Here, you can kick off your flip-flops and unwind with your toes in the sand, then rally your crew for a quick trip into downtown Jacksonville, where world-class sports action awaits. From the roar of the Jaguars at EverBank Stadium to the crack of the bat at a Jumbo Shrimp baseball game, this town serves up the perfect blend of relaxation and adrenaline.\nPublic Transportation to Jacksonville Stadiums and Sports Events\nThe quickest and most direct way to get to sporting events from Jacksonville Beach is to take a taxi or a rideshare. A thirty-minute ride carries sports fans from door to door. EverBank Stadium has a designated rideshare dropoff/pickup point on Beaver Street. The PLAYERS Tournament rideshare point is off ATP Boulevard.\nThe JTA (Jacksonville Transportation Authority) bus Line 10 brings beachgoers into downtown Jacksonville. At $2 - 6 per rider, this option is the cheapest way to get to games, but it does take around two hours. The JTA also operates a Gameday Xpress shuttle that picks up ticketholders from downtown spots like Kings Avenue and the Florida State College Campus. Shuttles are available for Jax Jags games and other select EverBank Field events, running two hours prior to kick-off and ending one hour after the game. Riders even receive a voucher for a free concession at the stadium.\nThe PLAYERS Tournament offers shuttle service from downtown Jacksonville and Nocatee neighborhoods.\nGame day transportation takes some time and planning. However, it is worth it to wake up to waves on the beach in the morning, and join in on doing the wave in the stands in the evening!\nWhere to Stay When Watching Sports in Jacksonville\nWhen it comes to catching the best of Jacksonville's sports scene while soaking up the coastal vibe, Margaritaville Beach Hotel Jacksonville Beach is your ultimate home base. Nestled right on the oceanfront, but only 18 miles from EverBank Stadium and VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, the resort is close to the action, but still far enough from the crowd for relaxation.\nWhether you are rooting for the Jacksonville Jaguars, watching championship golf, or taking your family to cheer on the minor league teams, the resort offers the best of both worlds, from beachside bliss to stadium thrills.\nReady to turn your game day into a getaway? Book your stay at Margaritaville Jacksonville Beach and let the good times roll. Check out our current offers to plan a winning vacation.\nJacksonville Pro Sports Teams\nPrevious Slide\nJacksonville Jaguars Football Games\nWhen: September to January\nWhere: EverBank Stadium, 1 EverBank Stadium Dr\nWhen football season hits, northeastern Florida turns into a sea of teal and gold, and there's no better way to dive into the action than with a Jacksonville Jaguars game at EverBank Stadium.\nJust a quick drive from the laid-back shores of Jacksonville Beach, the stadium comes alive with its fierce fans and legendary tailgate parties. Each home game draws an average crowd of 60,000 spectators, but there is always room for one or two more!\nGet a great view of the game wherever you sit, thanks to the stadium’s massive video screens. Jacksonville is also the only city with in-stadium pools! For a truly unique experience, get a special ticket to “the spa” and watch the endzone action from the deep end.\nCheck out the Jacksonville Jaguars schedule.\nJacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Baseball\nWhen: April to September\nWhere: VyStar Ballpark, 301 A Philip Randolph Blvd\nHead to a Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp game, where minor league baseball meets major vibes. Throughout the season, the team hosts giveaways and fun promotions like wizard-theme nights, and typical games are plenty entertaining. Fireworks happen every Friday home game, and on Sunday Family FUNdays, kids can run bases after the games. Most tickets are $20 or less, and $2 hot dogs are a staple at the stadium.\nAn evening at a Jumbo Shrimp game makes for an affordable and fun night out when you are staying at the beach.\nCheck out the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp schedule.\nJacksonville Sharks Indoor Football\nWhen: March to August\nWhere: VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena 300 A Philip Randolph Blvd\nWhen the Jacksonville Sharks hit the turf, the energy is nonstop and the action is up close and personal. This arena football crew brings big hits, fast plays, and a family-friendly atmosphere. Seats in the “Shark’s Pit” give fans an up-close view of every tackle and touchdown. Home games tend to have fun themes like rock and roll, pirates and princesses, or Halloween in June. After the final score, swap stadium lights for sunset skies back at the coast.\nCheck out the Jacksonville Sharks schedule.\nJacksonville Icemen Hockey\nFor a cool twist on coastal fun, catch the Jacksonville Icemen in action downtown. The city’s premier hockey team delivers good times for die-hard hockey fans and casual viewers alike. Gamegoers can enjoy unique experiences like a “fan penalty box” or a ride on the Zamboni post-game. Games are family-friendly, but also enjoyable for adults. The arena offers group rates and many special events throughout the season. With a short trip into the city, Jacksonville Beach visitors can enjoy all the adrenaline of a hockey brawl before heading back to the shore to unwind island-style.\nPlus, the second annual Margaritaville Night with the Icemen on December 26th 2025 might just be the perfect time to catch a game.\nCheck out the Jacksonville Icemen schedule.\nNext Slide\nJacksonville Sports: Special Events\nPrevious Slide\nTaxSlayer Gator Bowl\nWhen: December\nWhere: EverBank Stadium, 1 EverBank Stadium Dr\nAs the sixth-oldest college football bowl game, this Jacksonville tradition has been lighting up EverBank Stadium since 1946, drawing fans from across the country to cheer on top-tier SEC and ACC matchups.

Dubbed the “World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party,” the event is more than just a game; it is a week-long celebration filled with tailgating, concerts and community events that electrify the city. The rivalry is a Jacksonville tradition, but 2025 may be the final time the rumble happens in the city before it moves to a new venue for a few years due to renovations.\nCheck out this event.\nThe PLAYERS Championship\nWhen: March\nWhere: TPC at Sawgrass, Ponte Vedra Beach\nFor a sun-soaked holiday with a side of world-class golf, The PLAYERS Championship at TPC Sawgrass is a can’t-miss event. While most sports events happen downtown, this championship takes place steps away from the shore. Held annually in March in Ponte Vedra Beach, just a short drive from Jacksonville Beach, this tournament is a major event with top talent and a challenging course. The action typically takes place over four days, with plenty of time to enjoy the waves in between.\nCheck out this event.\nGate River Run\nWhen: March\nWhere: Downtown Jacksonville\nAs the largest 15K race in the United States, this annual event attracts over 15,000 participants each March. The course winds through the city's historic neighborhoods and over its iconic bridges.
