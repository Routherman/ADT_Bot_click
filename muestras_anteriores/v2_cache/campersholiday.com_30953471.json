      "text": "Our Story\nAbout\nFinding the Greatest Camping on Earth\nIn the 1960s, Lynn Morey had the vision to develop a parcel of property on the west side of Lake Sparkman 7 miles south of Brooksville, Florida. He divided the land into 300 separate sites, 240 sites for permanent residents, and 60 sites dedicated as a recreational vehicle (RV) campground.\nWe have only love here\nWelcoming Entrance\nForest\nLake Sparkman\nLake Sparkman2\nMcKethan Lake\nPavilion & Firepit\nPool facing East\nPool Table in Clubhouse\nsandhill cranes\nSeveral in the park\nShuffleboard\nsitting ducks\nSwimming Pool\nEACH CAMPER’S HOLIDAY\nFor almost 50 years, our campground has been known as the “greatest camping on earth.” The unique relationship between the 300 individual owners and campers in the RV campground means you get to enjoy well-kept and upgraded amenities year-round.\nMany of our first-time guests plan to spend only one or two nights. Then they experience our friendly community, prime location, amenities, activities, and quiet atmosphere.  After all this, our guests quickly extend their stays and/or plan their return visits.\nWe value each guest who makes their way to our campground. As a result, we work hard to ensure our campers experience each visit as a special holiday.\nCAMPIE BEAR\nDuring our early years our friendly bear, Campie, became our mascot and logo. While many things have changed through the years and updates have occurred to our campground and Campie Bear, our spirit remains the same. We at Camper’s Holiday look forward to each guest and work to ensure you experience the greatest camping on earth!",
