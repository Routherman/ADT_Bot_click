Overlooking the New River in downtown Fort Lauderdale, this premier performing arts venue hosts Broadway musicals, operas, ballets, concerts, plays, multi-cultural performances, lectures, workshops and educational events; and it offers one of the largest arts-in-education programs in the United States, serving more than 150,000 students annually.\nHistory\nFor some communities, the desire to build a major performing arts complex is only a dream. For the city of Fort Lauderdale and Broward County that dream came true with the development of the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, which opened on February 26, 1991 with a performance of The Phantom of the Opera that so many in the community recall.\nFrom concept to fruition, this world-class performing arts center was built with years of passion, planning and dedication. In the early 1980s, many in the community came together—from government, business and the private sector—because they knew a successful performing arts complex could be a catalyst for growth.\nThe city’s main performance halls—Fort Lauderdale’s War Memorial Auditorium, built in the 1940s, and the The Parker, constructed in the late 1960s—could not keep pace with the growing demands for the expanding South Florida cultural community.\nRecognizing the need for a more viable venue, one with a much greater seating capacity, state-of-the-art production facilities, spacious backstage areas and unique event spaces, these visionaries set forth to turn their dream into reality. Through a unique public/private partnership, the Broward Center for the Performing Arts was created and became the anchor of a new, vibrant cultural district in downtown Fort Lauderdale.\nIt has lived up to its promise and more. In 2009, a plan to re-imagine the Broward Center for the future was initiated: ENCORE!, Building Community through the Arts. With the renewed commitment by our public and private partners, and generous support from the community, a sprawling expansion project to renew and restore the Broward Center began in 2012. By 2014, the theaters were updated, new dining spaces were added, and all of the public areas were refreshed. As part of the expansion, the Broward Center opened two new buildings—the Huizenga Pavilion and the Rose Miniaci Arts Education Center, designed to add to the Broward Center experience.\nWe Thank Our\nMajor Sponsors\nSee All >\nSee Sponsors\nBroward Center for the Performing Arts\n201 Southwest 5th Avenue  , Fort Lauderdale, FL 33312\n954.462.0222\nAffiliated Venues\nAventura Arts & Cultural Center\nThe Parker\nRose & Alfred Miniaci Performing Arts Center\na\ncarbon\nhouse\nexperience\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhere is the best place to park?\nThe Broward Center recommends the Arts and Entertainment District Parking Garage or valet services as available.
