Their goal is to add to the charm of the community with a fun and enjoyable new attraction.\nIn 2017, they had the idea to seek out the old paddlewheel boat that was originally parked on the Dead River in Tavares.  This boat was special to them because they had their wedding rehearsal dinner on it almost 20 years prior.  They were quickly connected with Robbie Cunningham, owner of the boat.  After seeing it, they knew they wanted to purchase it and their vision began from there.\nThe Dora Contessa, the original paddlewheel boat was powered by two 90 horsepower engines and could carry up to 49 passengers.  Now named the Dora Queen she is 80 feet long and 35 feet wide. The Dora Queen is powered by two 250 horsepower engines and has the capacity for 70 passengers.  Commissioned and built by Robbie Cunningham at Trident Pontoons in Tavares, Florida, the construction of the vessel took over two years.  The original paddlewheel and helm are still a part of the vessel today.\nThe Dora Queen has two levels of lounge style seating and a state of the art sound system.  So sit back, relax and enjoy all the majestic views that Lake Dora has to offer.\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nContact Dora Queen\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nWe welcome your input and value your feedback!\nWe take pride in offering you a memorable and relaxing experience aboard the Dora Queen.  Please complete the form below to share your opinion or ask questions.  A staff member will respond to your email in a timely manner.\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nDora Queen Docking Location\nTavares Marina\n375 S.
