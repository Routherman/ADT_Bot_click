After a great time on the links, sit on the patio and enjoy a cold drink and a delicious lunch or a Friday dinner as you reconnect. If that sounds like a day in paradise to you, you’re closer than you think. It’s yours already at Gator Trace Golf & Country Club.\nAbout a four-iron shot east of U.S. 1 and west of the Indian River at 4302 Gator Trace Drive off Weatherbee Road, just north of Midway in Fort Pierce (adjacent to Port Saint Lucie and Vero Beach), Gator Trace Golf & Country Club has been offering great golf and an awesome lifestyle since 1986. Our semi-private, semi-public golf course is open for daily play, and also offers annual and seasonal memberships.

Lantie, General Manager and PGA Master Professional, describes it like this, “Gator Trace is home, so friendly and so comfortable. There are a lot of great courses around here, but people come to Gator Trace because it’s fun. When they walk in the door they know everyone here. People come back season after season and the same people are here. Cynthia and I have been here over 30 years. Many of our staff have been here 20+ years. It’s a familiar and friendly atmosphere. Just a fun place to be.”\nCynthia, Dining & Events Manager, adds, “About 18,000 people come through the dining room each year. There’s a magnitude of responsibility to keeping everything running smoothly, and there are lots of additional activities we are involved in every day. Lantie and I always have such a great time with people, so when we have functions, we enjoy the camaraderie. As far as the business goes, we try to make it fun for everybody, and we’re always looking for things we can do to improve Gator Trace. It’s definitely a labor of love.”\nWEBSITE\nwww.gatortracecountryclub.com\nPHONE\nGolf Shop  772-464-0407\nClubhouse  772-464-7442\nOffice 772-468-4653\nADDRESS\n4302 Gator Trace Dr., Fort Pierce, FL 34982\nAbout Us\nWhy folks love Gator Trace\nGreat golf, food, fun and friends at Gator Trace\nGator Trace Golf & Country Club, located on the fringes of the Savannas Preserve with its native vegetation, lakes, ponds and canals, is a beautiful slice of Florida paradise.

Lantie and I always have such a great time with people, so when we have functions, we enjoy the camaraderie. As far as the business goes, we try to make it fun for everybody, and we’re always looking for things we can do to improve Gator Trace.
