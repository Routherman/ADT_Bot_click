      "text": "// CATEGORY NAV\nThe mission of the Panama City Music Association, Inc., is to bring the excitement of classical and modern music, dance, opera, and musical theatre to the widest possible audience. Our goal is to expand the musical experience of our community, to further develop an appreciation for all aspects of music, and to increase the participation of youth in musical arts. In our efforts to bring performances of the highest quality to the Bay County area, we strive to awaken and perpetuate the love of music in all whom we serve.\nPanama City Music Association (PCMA) is a volunteer organization operating as a not-for-profit 501(c) (3) organization. Since 1941, the Panama City Music Association has presented a monumental number of concerts featuring the top soloists, ensembles, symphonies, operas, Broadway musicals, dancers, and ethnic groups. The concerts have been the best the world has to offer.\nThe Panama City Music Association presented their concerts in the Bay High auditorium long before the Marina Civic Center was built. The PCMA, the oldest presenter in the area, is also the only concert association who presents Opera.  Each year, over 300 students of music and dance are able to attend a PCMA performance due to your support/memberships and donations.",
