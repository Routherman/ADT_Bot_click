      "text": "Our Founders' Story\nLinktree is a tool to help you share everything you are, in one simple link â making your online content more discoverable, easier to manage and more likely to convert. Hereâs where it all began.\nIn 2016 brothers Alex and Anthony Zaccaria and their business partner Nick Humphreys found a common pain point when running their digital agency, Bolster, managing social media accounts for their clients. Endlessly updating singular bio links felt like a waste of time, or worse, often got overlooked. Overnight, the first iteration of Linktree was live, and we havenât looked back since!\nToday, with 70M+ users worldwide, weâre helping brands, artists, publishers, agencies and influencers better control their presence online. As the internet became more fragmented, we grew Linktreeâs functionality to better serve those using it and to streamline the content-sharing process.\nWeâre a passionate team of developers, designers, marketers and biz ops, committed to equipping content-creators with the best tools for getting their work seen. Weâre headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and have offices in Sydney, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nIn 2019 we were thrilled to be one of CNBCâs âUpstart 100â, a list of the âbrightest, most intriguing, young startups promising to become the great companies of tomorrowâ. In March 2020, Fast Company honored us in their âMost Innovative Companies of 2020â list, placing us number four in the Social Media category. Previous honorees of the Social Media fourth place include Glossier and Reddit.\nJumpstart your corner of the\ninternet today\nOops!
