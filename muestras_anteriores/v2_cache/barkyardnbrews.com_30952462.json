      "text": "BarkYard n’ Brews\nis one of South Florida’s first off-leash Dog Park, Beer and Wine Bar. Conveniently\nlocated in Fort Lauderdale FL, just off of I-95\n. BarkYard n’ Brews was started to create a safe and fun environment to promote the socialization between humans and their dogs. All patrons are welcome at Barkyard n’ Brews, but a\nmembership\nis required for all of our dog patrons. Your monthly or yearly annual membership helps us to ensure all dogs are healthy, up to date with vaccines, friendly and non-aggressive. We also offer Daily Dog Passes and anyone without a dog is more than welcome to visit free of charge. You do not need to bring a dog, you just have to like them!\nDOG PARK & BEER GARDEN\n817 NW First Street\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33311\nWhy BYNB?\nBarkYard n’ Brews\nis a safe and clean outdoor Dog Park. Our BarkYard offers 10,000 square feet of outdoor, fenced in, off-leash play for you and your dog’s enjoyment. The play area is covered with Astro Turf for a clean all-natural comfortable play surface. The BarkYard also features a splash pad for your dogs to stay cool and enjoy. We will have our friendly, experienced dog monitors “Wooferies” walking around the park to assist all our patrons. Wooferies are trained to monitor the dogs’ behavior and are there to maintain a safe friendly environment. Wooferies are there to monitor play behavior, not to doggie sit. We will be offering grooming services very soon.\nBYNB Highlights\nOutdoor Bar Area\nLocal Craft & Domestic Beer, Wine & Soda\nFree WiFi Throughout the Park\nSplash Pad\nCooling Stations\nCovered seating\nBYNB Food and Drink\nAlthough we do not serve food. We will have the best of Ft. Lauderdale’s food trucks available on Event Days and on Weekends.\nYou are also welcome to order food delivery. We only ask that you eat in a designated area. Food is NOT allowed in the off-leash play area. Together we can make BarkYard n’ Brews an experience for you and your dog that will have you returning again and again. Thank you and see you soon!\n– The BarkYard n’ Brews Team",
