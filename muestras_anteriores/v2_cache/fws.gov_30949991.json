The 42,657-acre refuge ranges in elevation from 1,800 to 5,600 feet, supporting a wide variety of habitats --forests, rolling hills, open meadows, lakes, rivers and marshes. This mix of habitat types supports a wide variety of plants and animals, as well as healthy watersheds, clear streams, and clean water. Historically, the resources protected by the refuge have been important to local economies and helped drive growth in the region.\nImage Details\nCatastrophic wildfires are increasing and at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge, foresters and biologists are restoring more wildfire resilient forests.\nThe only mountainous mixed-conifer forest refuge in the lower 48, Little Pend Oreille encompasses six distinct forest zones and features species such as Douglas fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, western white pine, western red cedar, western hemlock, and subalpine fir. Fire has been an important part of the natural cycles in these refuge forests, but today they are burning hotter and faster than ever before. Invasive species like white pine blister rust and changes in forest management policy have contributed to the rise in these catastrophic wildfires. In some places, forest stands are too dense; and in others they need restoration through tree planting. The refuge uses weed management, tree and vegetation planting, and other science-based management tools to achieve conservation goals for forests and restore a more fire resilient ecosystem.\nImage Details\nUn-treated and treated with commercial thinning forest stands at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe buildup of ladder fuels–forest litter, brush and younger trees–causes wildfires to burn hotter, longer and faster. The more difficult and dangerous to combat fires can reach more mature trees and treetops and kills more trees. Prescribed fires can be used to mimic natural fires that once cleared old vegetation from the land helping native plants regenerate and local wildlife to thrive. Using carefully planned prescribed fire, the refuge can reduce ladder fuels to create more defensible forests. Restoring regular, smaller fires to the ecosystem helps make the forests less susceptible to catastrophic wildfire.\nImage Details\nPrescribed fires are an essential treatment used to reduce ladder fuels at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nCommercial and non-commercial tree thinning can also reduce the amount of ladder fuels in some tree stands. Selectively targeting certain trees can reduce competition for sunlight and water and remove fuel that contributes to out-of-control wildfire. After thinning, leftover vegetation is gathered into piles and, after a year or more, burned by refuge fire personnel.\nImage Details\nHealthy forests protect watersheds and wildlife, ensuring future generations of Americans can enjoy our natural heritage.\nStrategic planning takes place each year to determine which treatment is appropriate for different tree stands. When commercial thinning is the best treatment for an area, the refuge will put that job out for bid in the local community. This win-win approach benefits taxpayers, contributes to America’s economy and supports the refuge’s conservation mission.\nImage Details\nWildlife depend on the healthy forests and clean water protected and maintained by Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nEach refuge is established for a special purpose and Little Pend Oreille was established to protect the places native wildlife and migratory birds need to rest and raise their young. Thousands of visitors enjoy the refuge each year—camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, and experiencing all its forests and habitats have to offer. Refuges like Little Pend Oreille generate billions of dollars in economic output and wages, as well as local, county, and state tax revenue, key contributions to the trillion-dollar outdoor recreation industry. The innovative, active management of the refuge protects the Northwest's historic landscapes, ensuring future generations can enjoy and benefit from America’s natural heritage.\nImage Details\nA family enjoys boating at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nStory Tags\nEconomics\nFire management\nForests\nHarvest\nNatural infrastructure\nNatural resource conservation\nPrescribed burning\nResource management\nVisitor services\nVisitors\nWildlife refuges\nRecreational Activities\nAccessible trails\nAuto tour\nBirding\nCamping\nEducation programs\nFishing\nHiking\nHunting\nWildlife watching\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nWorking Lands\nFacilities\nKootenai National Wildlife Refuge\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge\nTurnbull National Wildlife Refuge\nLatest Stories\nCurrent Road Status at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge\nSep 2, 2025\nMigratory Species\nMigratory Bird Annual Status Reports\nSep 2, 2025\nA Victory Against Invasive Species\nSep 2, 2025\nPagination\nPrevious page\nCurrent page\n1\nPage\n2\nPage\n3\nPage\n4\nPage\n5\nPage\n6\nPage\n7\nPage\n8\nPage\n9\nNext page\nProtecting the Forests that Helped Build America\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nImage Details\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge is protecting the special places in the Northwest that defined the region and supported economic growth.\nNear Colville, in the northeast corner of Washington state, Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge restores and protects the forests that helped build America.

The refuge uses weed management, tree and vegetation planting, and other science-based management tools to achieve conservation goals for forests and restore a more fire resilient ecosystem.\nImage Details\nUn-treated and treated with commercial thinning forest stands at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe buildup of ladder fuels–forest litter, brush and younger trees–causes wildfires to burn hotter, longer and faster. The more difficult and dangerous to combat fires can reach more mature trees and treetops and kills more trees. Prescribed fires can be used to mimic natural fires that once cleared old vegetation from the land helping native plants regenerate and local wildlife to thrive. Using carefully planned prescribed fire, the refuge can reduce ladder fuels to create more defensible forests. Restoring regular, smaller fires to the ecosystem helps make the forests less susceptible to catastrophic wildfire.\nImage Details\nPrescribed fires are an essential treatment used to reduce ladder fuels at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nCommercial and non-commercial tree thinning can also reduce the amount of ladder fuels in some tree stands. Selectively targeting certain trees can reduce competition for sunlight and water and remove fuel that contributes to out-of-control wildfire. After thinning, leftover vegetation is gathered into piles and, after a year or more, burned by refuge fire personnel.\nImage Details\nHealthy forests protect watersheds and wildlife, ensuring future generations of Americans can enjoy our natural heritage.\nStrategic planning takes place each year to determine which treatment is appropriate for different tree stands. When commercial thinning is the best treatment for an area, the refuge will put that job out for bid in the local community. This win-win approach benefits taxpayers, contributes to America’s economy and supports the refuge’s conservation mission.\nImage Details\nWildlife depend on the healthy forests and clean water protected and maintained by Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nEach refuge is established for a special purpose and Little Pend Oreille was established to protect the places native wildlife and migratory birds need to rest and raise their young. Thousands of visitors enjoy the refuge each year—camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, and experiencing all its forests and habitats have to offer. Refuges like Little Pend Oreille generate billions of dollars in economic output and wages, as well as local, county, and state tax revenue, key contributions to the trillion-dollar outdoor recreation industry. The innovative, active management of the refuge protects the Northwest's historic landscapes, ensuring future generations can enjoy and benefit from America’s natural heritage.\nImage Details\nA family enjoys boating at Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge.\nStory Tags\nEconomics\nFire management\nForests\nHarvest\nNatural infrastructure\nNatural resource conservation\nPrescribed burning\nResource management\nVisitor services\nVisitors\nWildlife refuges\nRecreational Activities\nAccessible trails\nAuto tour\nBirding\nCamping\nEducation programs\nFishing\nHiking\nHunting\nWildlife watching\nAccessible trails\nAuto tour\nBirding\nCamping\nEducation programs\nFishing\nHiking\nHunting\nWildlife watching\nWritten By\nMegan Nagel\nMegan Nagel\nMegan Nagel\nWorking Lands\nFacilities\nKootenai National Wildlife Refuge\nLittle Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge\nTurnbull National Wildlife Refuge\nLatest Stories\nCurrent Road Status at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge\nSep 2, 2025\nMigratory Species\nMigratory Bird Annual Status Reports\nSep 2, 2025\nA Victory Against Invasive Species\nSep 2, 2025\nPagination\nPrevious page\nCurrent page\n1\nPage\n2\nPage\n3\nPage\n4\nPage\n5\nPage\n6\nPage\n7\nPage\n8\nPage\n9\nNext page\nCurrent Road Status at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge\nSep 2, 2025\nMigratory Species\nMigratory Bird Annual Status Reports\nSep 2, 2025\nA Victory Against Invasive Species\nSep 2, 2025\nWorking with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.",

It is world famous for spectacular migratory bird populations. The refuge was established in 1945 to safeguard and enhance the wildlife habitat of Sanibel Island, to protect endangered and threatened species, and to provide feeding, nesting, and roosting areas for migratory birds. In 1967, the refuge was renamed for conservation pioneer Jay Norwood “Ding” Darling, who was instrumental in its founding.

For over 2,000 years the Calusa Indians made the lush island, with its ready source of food from the sea, their home. By the mid 1800s, European settlers arrived and soon displaced the Calusa tribe. For years the island was mainly used by farmers until a fierce hurricane in 1926 destroyed the agriculture industry. Construction of the Sanibel causeway in 1963 opened way for tourism on the island. Jay Norwood Darling was instrumental in the effort to block the sale of a parcel of environmentally valuable land to developers on Sanibel Island. At Darling's urging, President Harry S.
