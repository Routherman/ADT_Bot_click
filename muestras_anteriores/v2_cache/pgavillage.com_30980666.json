Susan has made her mark on the sport, both as a player and as an instructor for countless aspiring golfers. Her commitment to the game and her community has earned her numerous accolades and awards, including the  Player Development Award, RIPGA Teacher of the Year, the Bill Strausbaugh Award, the Professional Development Award, The Patriot Award and her induction into the 2023 New England PGA Hall of Fame. These accolades stand as a testament to her tireless efforts in promoting the game of golf and supporting her fellow professionals and community members.\nA Legacy of Teaching Excellence\nSusan's journey as a PGA Professional began in 1990 when she assumed the role of Assistant Professional at the Wellesley Country Club in Massachusetts. Over the years, she served in various capacities, including Head Golf Professional at Weekapaug Golf Club in Rhode Island, where she honed her skills and enriched her experience. Susan is  committed to education and development which  led her to take on the role of a Teaching Professional at renowned clubs such as Johns Island Club in Florida and Grand Harbor Golf Club. Her exceptional ability to create a fun and friendly  learning environment and impart expert knowledge makes her one of the most sought-after instructors in the business. We are confident that you will appreciate that Susan keeps it simple with  all her programming.\nA Stellar Playing Career\nAside from her teaching prowess, Susan has also showcased her skills on the golf course. Her list of achievements as a player is outstanding,  winning the Connecticut Sr. Womens Open, Ohio Sr. Womens Open, the LPGA Teaching and Club Professional Sr., the South Florida Sr. Womens Championship, along with qualifying for her second USGA Sr. Womens Open in the 2024 season.  Her victories in the 2020 Tennessee Senior Women's Open and the 2017 Florida Women's Senior Open are just a glimpse of her remarkable playing career. Since graduating from the University of Alabama, where she was the captain of the team, she has won many PGA Section along with mini tour events.   Susan loves to play golf and would love to play golf with members of the PGA Golf Club.\nBeyond the Greens\nSusan's interests extend beyond the golf course. She finds joy in playing golf with her husband PGA professional Ron Philo Jr. and her role as a mom to Lindsey, Christina, and their four-legged companions - two black labs, a golden retriever, and a kitty. Her commitment to giving back to society is evident through her volunteering efforts with veterans and the disabled, helping them discover the joy of golf and its therapeutic benefits.\nContact Info\n1916 Perfect Drive, Port St. Lucie, FL 34986\n[email protected]\n800-800-GOLF (4653)\nQuick Links\nJoin Our Team\nGift Cards\nDonation Request\nPrivacy Policy\nCalifornia Privacy Policy\nTerms of Service\n©\nPGA Golf Club.\nAll rights reserved.\nPowered by\nNorthstar Technologies\n.\nHTML Generator\nInstructor-bios\n-\nSub Navigation\nPrivate Lessons\nClinics\nJunior Programs\nGOLF SCHOOLS\nInstructor-bios\nInstruction\nPrivate Lessons\nClinics\nJunior Programs\nGOLF SCHOOLS\nInstructor-bios\nUntitled BIO LISTING\nINSTRUCTOR BIOS\nAlex Iguchi, PGA\nPGA Class A Member, PGA Certified\n[email protected]\nO: 772-467-5491\nAwards & Recognitions\n2023 Teacher of the Year South Florida PGA SE Chapter\n2024 GRAA Top 100 Growth of the Game Teaching Professional\nEducation & Certifications\nPGA Class-A Member\nPGA Certified – General Management\nPGA Certified – Player Development\nPGA Golf Professional Diploma Van Swinderen College, Netherlands\nCES Army Basic Leadership\nEyeline Certified Instructor\nHank Haney Certified Instructor\nJim McLean Certified Instructor\nSuper Speed Golf 1, 2 & 3\nTPI Level 1 Titleist Performance Institute\nTPI Junior 2 Titleist Performance Institute\nTrackman Level 1 &2 Trackman University\nClub Fitting Certifications\nTaylor Made, Callaway, Ping, Mizuno, Titleist, Cobra, Tommy Armour, Tour Edge, XXIO, Bettinardi, Edel\nProfessional Experience\nAlex Iguchi is a PGA Class A Certified Golf Professional with 29 years of experience coaching and managing golf instruction programs nationally and abroad, including in Florida, Hawaii, California, Georgia, Costa Rica, Japan, Netherlands and Ukraine, where he earned the nickname “the teacher of teachers” for his work mentoring assistant professionals to become the next generation of golf instructors and club head golf professionals.\nAn ardent student of the game, Alex uses his impressive teaching credentials in technology, biomechanics and didactics to offer the most up to date instruction in a logical, effective and easy to comprehend manner and successfully helps his students of all levels and all ages to achieve their goals by building a personal plan around their abilities, available practice time, and the philosophy of: “Train how you play; Play how you train”.\nAlex describes himself as a patient and supportive golf coach and looks forward to working with you.\nSusan Bond-Philo, PGA\n[email protected]\nC: 401-741-7545\nDedication and Achievement in Golf\nSusan Bond-Philo is a name well known with excellence and dedication in the world of golf.
