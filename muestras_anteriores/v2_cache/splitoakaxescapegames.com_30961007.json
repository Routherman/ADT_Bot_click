Our goal is to provide you with a new experience filled with action and excitement in a safe, friendly, and healthy environment. We serve small bites, an array of craft & domestic beer, wine, and hard seltzers.\nSplit Oak Axescape Games is committed to providing the best axe throwing and escape room experience for all size groups.

We also have 2 one hour themed escape rooms to experience with your group if axe throwing isn’t your thing. We can accommodate group parties, private events as well as team-building and corporate events. Our team of Game Guides is here to keep our guests safe and create a fun and unforgettable experience.\nOur venue has a modern industrial vibe with relaxed seating and spans over 4,500 square feet of interior space that can be enjoyed with flat-screen TVs and lobby games.\nSplit Oak Axescape Games were founded by Robert & Nichole, residents of Lake Nona, with the vision to provide a modern industrial community gathering place for all to enjoy.\nAXE THROWING TIPS & TECHNIQUES\nJuly 11, 2023\nAXE THROWING STANCE\nThe most important tip for axe throwing technique is your stance. There are two stances: two-handed and one-handed.\nTwo-handed Stance: Align your feet with the bullseye and keep your body facing forward as you throw. (\nEasiest for Beginners\n)\nOne-handed Stance: Align your shoulder with the bullseye and maintain a forward-facing stance, focusing on shoulder-to-target alignment. (\nAdvanced Approach\n)\nAXE REMOVAL\nTaking an axe out of a target can be tricky. The best and safest way to do so is to grasp the handle and shift the axe blade up and down until it gradually falls loose from the target. Do not grab the axe and try to pull it straight out. This could result in it coming out quickly and potentially causing serious harm or injury.\nWATCH OUT FOR PEOPLE AND OBSTACLES\nBefore you throw your axe at your intended wooden target, make sure there is no one and nothing in your way. You should be standing in front of the target, about 12 ft from it. Nobody, not even the most experienced axe thrower, should ever throw without double-checking their surroundings. Maintain a six-foot radius around where you are standing to assure you won’t harm anyone.\nHOW TO AIM YOUR AXE\nWhen aiming your axe, it is essential to maintain focus on the target. Keep your eyes locked onto the specific spot where you want the axe to land and throw with precision. Directing your gaze toward the desired destination increases your chances of hitting the mark accurately. By staying focused and aligning your vision with your intended target, you enhance your chances of achieving your desired outcome.\nDISTANCE ADJUSTMENTS\nDifferent outcomes can occur when throwing an axe at a target, and adjustments can be made to improve your throws:\nTop of Axe Hits Board:\nIf the handle sticks out almost perpendicular to the board while the axe goes into the target, it indicates over-rotation. To compensate, take a half step closer to the target.\nBottom of Axe Hits Board:\nWhen the bottom or handle of the axe hits the target, you are standing too close. It suggests under-rotation. To correct this, take a half step back from the target.\nBlade Hits Parallel to Board:\nThis is the desired outcome. The axe handle will be nearly parallel to the target, and the front of the blade will be embedded in the target. It signifies the right distance from the target and excellent throwing form.\nESCAPE ROOM TIPS & TRICKS\nDON’T JUST STAND THERE!\nBe active and engage with the environment. Explore and interact with objects to find clues.\nWORK FAST AND ASK FOR CLUES\nDon’t hesitate to ask for hints early and often. Waiting until the end might leave you short on time.\nWORK TOGETHER\nWork as a team but spread out to find clues throughout the room.\nCOLLABORATE YOUR SKILL SETS\nUtilize the diverse skills within your team. Try different perspectives if stuck.\nTHINK OUTSIDE THE BOX\nGet creative and think like a storyteller or director when stuck. Let the narrative guide your reasoning.\nSHARE WHAT YOU SEE AND FIND\nCommunicate all findings and thoughts to the team. Sharing is the key to solving puzzles.\nPOLICIES\nPLEASE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY\nNO REFUNDS\nNo refunds for late arrivals, no-shows, or cancellations.\nStrict adherence to the schedule is required.\nCHECK-IN\nCheck-in is\n15 minutes prior\nto booking time to allow time for briefs and rules video.\nCHANGES TO BOOKING\nChanges to bookings allowed up to\n24 hours in advance\n.\nNO SHOWS\nNo-shows are defined as failing to arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled booking time. No-shows result in cancellation and fees are\nNOT\nrefunded.\nLATE ARRIVALS\nLate arrivals lead to reduced throw/game time. Your time starts at the booked time, not when you arrive. The throw/game time is over when your allotted time runs out, regardless of the group’s tardy beginnings. Stay sharp and timely.\nABOUT\nSPLIT OAK AXESCAPE GAMES\nSplit Oak Axescape Games is the first axe throwing and escape room venue in St. Cloud, Florida.
