      "text": "About\nAt El Camino, our guiding principle is to exceed our guest’s expectations in all areas – food, beverage, and ambiance – and create an experience that will arouse and excite our guest’s senses.\nAs a team, we are inspired by the culture and the heritage of Mexico. To that end, we are passionate about bringing you an authentic experience not typically seen north of the border in chain restaurants.\nWe are committed to offering the freshest organic and local ingredients where possible, and we value local, artisan, indigenous and reclaimed offerings. We are even taking the not so typical step of making our own tortillas, sauces, and anything else possible from scratch.\nThe list of craft cocktails is truly Mexican and includes house made sangritas, a curated selection of agave spirits, a diverse selection of craft and Mexican beers. In the end, it is all about sharing the food with the community of people who enjoy it.\nViva México!",
