Through their nurturing and dedication, the event grew considerably.\nThe NBAW is a free event held on the third Thursday of each month from 5-9 pm. Featuring many local visual artists and live performers, the streets of the Beaches Town Center - where Atlantic Boulevard meets the ocean - erupt with creativity and liveliness. What was once a small pool of carefully selected artists has now become a bubbling ocean of art, a place where woodworkers commingle with mixed media designers, and musicians play into the night.\nThe overall mission of Art Walk is to expose the community to the vast number of local Artists right here at the Beaches. Talent from all over North East Florida shows at the North Beaches Art Walk. With over 50+ participating artists, NBAW is a diverse art destination and shopping experience for the entire family. Local venues in Beaches Town Center set the backdrop for this great monthly destination and community gathering. We welcome locals and out of towners alike, to bring you a communal experience.\n​\nThe North Beaches Art Walk is orchestrated by the North Beaches Art Walk Association, a nonprofit organization 501 (c)(3) based in Atlantic Beach, FL.
