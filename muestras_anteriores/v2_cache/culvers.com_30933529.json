We know you have a lot to do and many options to choose from, so we appreciate when you take the time to visit Culver’s. If we can do our part to make your day better – with a wholesome, delicious meal or a heartfelt smile – we’ve done our job.\nHandcrafted Freshness\nAs Craig Culver always says, \"We never compromise on quality.\" It’s a promise that begins with sourcing the best ingredients and continues through to the way we prepare your meal: fresh, just for you.\nIt’s why we always use fresh, never frozen beef and whole, white meat chicken from America's family farms. It’s why we only use family farm-fresh dairy for our Frozen Custard. And it’s why every single Cheese Curd we’ve served has come from a Wisconsin dairy farm. We care about where your food comes from because we know you do too.\nWe also know quality is something you can taste. So every ButterBurger is cooked to order and topped with a lightly buttered, toasted bun. And our Fresh Frozen Custard is made in small batches right in the restaurant all day, every day. It’s not the easiest way to do it, but we believe it’s the right way.\nHometown Hospitality\nHospitality has always been near and dear to our hearts. So, dining in or on the go, we make a point of treating you the way we’d want to be treated. From holding a door to asking about your meal, it’s our pleasure to serve you – and we do it with a smile.\nOur dedication to hospitality goes back to Craig’s mother, Ruth Culver, who had a special way about her that made every guest who visited Culver’s feel welcomed like a guest in her home. Carrying on her legacy continues to be our truest measure of success, whether in our first restaurant in Sauk City or one of the 900-plus Culver’s locations across the United States.\nThe Heart of Culver’s\nDelighting in Every Moment\nOur team members are always looking for opportunities to bring a smile to your day – because when you’re happy, we’re happy.\nPracticing Kindness\nWe treat others the way we’d want to be treated, both inside our restaurants and out in our communities.\nDoing the Right Thing\nWe go the extra mile to do what’s right for our friends, neighbors and team members, because you deserve our best.\nThanks for the Love\nWhile happy guests are how we know we’re doing it right, here are a few additional honors that make us proud. We hope we continue to meet your expectations of fresh, quality meals with a heartfelt \"Welcome to Delicious.\"\nHOSPITALITY WITH HEART\nCulver’s has grown from a single Wisconsin restaurant to a national franchise by blending community engagement, tech innovation and menu creativity.\nRead about Culver's keys to success\nNFL LEGEND JJ WATT TEAMS UP WITH CULVER'S\nWisconsin native JJ Watt partnered with Culver’s to launch his favorite meal, JJ’s Way.\nSee the collaboration\nCONTINUED GROWTH\nCulver’s has become a top 30 restaurant chain, thanks to strong sales and a diverse, Wisconsin-inspired menu.\nRead about Culver's expansion\nFRESHNESS THAT SETS US APART\nCulver’s emphasizes quality rooted deep in Midwestern culture.
