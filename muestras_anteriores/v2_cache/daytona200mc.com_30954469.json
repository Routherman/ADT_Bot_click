We were chartered by the\nAmerican Motorcyclist Association (AMA)\nin 1960 as\nClub #421.\nHowever, AMA records show that the club was active as early as\nFebruary 1947\n, when we were mentioned in the AMA magazine as the \"Daytona Beach Motorcycle Club.\" Due to a fire that destroyed AMA's early records in 1960, our exact founding date is unclear, but it's believed that the club's roots trace back to the early days of the\nDaytona 200\nmotorcycle race.\nOur Origins\nThe club's story began when the AMA called for local riders to volunteer as flagmen for the\nDaytona 200\nrace held on the beach and road course starting in\n1937.\nThese riders continued their volunteer work through\n1941\n, until the race was suspended after the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the race was paused in\n1942\n, these dedicated riders decided to formally organize and founded the\nDaytona Beach Motorcycle Club\nin\nMay 1943.\nOur Legacy\nFrom the very beginning, we were a diverse group of dirt bike and road riding enthusiasts. In\n1949\n, we founded the legendary\nAlligator Enduro\n, which quickly became a cornerstone of our club's identity. For over\n30 years\n, we proudly hosted this challenging event. However, in\n1980-1981\n, the club underwent a significant transformation. The dirt riders formed the\nDaytona Dirt Riders\nand continued the tradition of the Endure, while the\nDaytona 200 MC\ncreated the\nAlligator Road Tour\n-a popular new ride during\nBike Week.\nUnfortunately, the\n2020 pandemic\nled to the cancellation of the Road Tour, and its future remains uncertain as we navigate the next chapter of the event.\nGiving Back to the Community\nFor more than 40 years, we organized the annual Our Kids Charity Run, which raised significant funds for local children's organizations, including the Children's Home Society of Volusia, Flagler, and Putnam counties. We are proud to have supported causes like Our Children First and many other local charities.\nWe believe in the importance of community, and in addition to charity runs, we host dinner rides, charity poker runs,\n            and monthly social gatherings. Our overnight rides have taken us to destinations such as Bok Tower Gardens and the\n            Ozella Trail, creating lasting memories for all involved.\nWelcoming Riders from Everywhere\nWe embrace riders from all over the world and offer motorcycle-only tent camping on our grounds during Bike Week and\n            Biketoberfest. This helps fund our operations and allows us to connect with riders from all across the United States-and\n            even the world! We've had campers stay with us for over 20 years and have hosted weddings during these iconic events.\nOur camping grounds have welcomed riders from Sweden, England, Italy, Brazil, Russia, Canada, and several other\n            countries, making every event a truly international experience.\nInstanceEndEditable\ncol-xs-12\nrow\nstarter-template\ncontainer\nbody-bkgrd\nDaytona 200 Motorcycle Club\n3602 W.
