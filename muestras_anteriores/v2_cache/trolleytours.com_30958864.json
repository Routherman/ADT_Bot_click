The endowment is generously matched 1:1 by the William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust, doubling the impact of each contribution to benefit deserving students.\nInvesting In Kids – INK!\nInvesting in Kids (INK!) is the sole direct support organization for the St. Johns County School District, providing innovative programs and classroom resources to close the literacy gap, improve graduation rates, and help all students reach their full potential. Historic Tours of America proudly supports INK! financially throughout the year with various fundraisers and contests, including the annual Jail Break 5K ‘Run for a Cause,’ scholarships, and performance opportunities for school bands, choirs, and a cappella groups. Additionally, we sponsor the annual county-wide Holiday Tree Decorating Contest, the St. Johns County School Calendar, and co-sponsor the St. Johns County Teacher of the Year banquet.\nInternational Board of Credentialing and Continuing Educational Standards\nAll of Historic Tours of America’s St. Augustine tours and attractions have earned the designation of Certified Autism Centers. This certification ensures that our organization is fully equipped to better serve Guests with autism or other sensory sensitivities, enhancing the Guest experience for all. It also empowers our CAST with the confidence to handle various situations that may arise. All St. Augustine CASTmembers are required to complete autism training within their first 90 days of employment. In addition, leadership undergoes more in-depth certification to further their competency. HTA is leading the charge for the city of St. Augustine to one day be named a Certified Autism Friendly Destination.\nSt. Johns County School District Life Work Transition Program\nThe Life Work Transition Program is an outcome-driven post-secondary option designed for 18 to 22-year-old students with disabilities in the St. Johns County School District. These students have met all graduation requirements but have deferred receiving their diplomas to further develop essential skills for successful employment, social interactions, and independent living. Historic Tours of America provides these students with the opportunity to explore employment through various hands-on work experiences within our operations while integrating classroom learning. St. Johns County school staff assist students in setting individualized goals, identifying needs, and developing specific skill sets, helping to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation and adult services once their deferment period ends.\nAnnual Martin Luther King Breakfast\nAfter the title sponsor withdrew, Historic Tours of America stepped in to support the annual commemorative breakfast. The sold-out event will now be held at the larger Renaissance Hotel downtown. The event honors the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his pivotal role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Following the breakfast, hundreds will join a half-mile walk through the streets of St. Augustine to the Plaza de la Constitución, retracing the steps of the marches Dr. King led here during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

She was exceptional with lots of details about what we were seeing and a marvelous sense of humor and story telling. We did the complete circuit with her and decided to continue with her again until we got to the Country Music Hall of Fame. She was the best tour guide we have had in years. A real Nashville highlight!”\nS.M., Fountain Valley, CA\n“Owen is an absolutely amazing guide!!!!! My colleague and I had a conference in Nashville in September and since neither of us had visited the city before, we decided a tour was a great place to start. We were lucky enough to step onto Owen’s trolley and immensely enjoyed his energy and knowledge of the city. We ended up staying on for the entire circuit just to listen to him…”\nB.B., Westfield, IN\n“…Your driver Trey made our whole Nashville trip a blast. He was so much fun. We laughed until we hurt; hard to believe a bus tour could be so much fun. You’ve got a winner in Trey, keep him if you can.”\nS.R.\n“We just enjoyed a fantastic tour of Nashville with our new cousin Debbie. She was very knowledgeable, funny and a superb host. So pleased to have toured with her. We are from Liverpool, England, which is famous for its comedians (and the Beatles) and she would be very welcome there! Thank you Debbie and Old Town Tours.”\nI.M., Caribou Marsh, NS\n“We took the Nashville Old Town Trolley Tour with Tater as our guide. Loved the tour and our guide. He was energetic, funny, and very knowledgeable as well as being kind and helpful. Would definitely return for a tour with Tater.”\nL.J.\n“My co-worker and I did the soul tour in Nashville. It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end! Janice was our guide and she was extremely engaging. Her love of the city and music was palpable. I believe our driver was Trevor… He was awesome as well. At the end of the tour, he offered to wait until our Uber arrived. Kudos to both and definitely 5 stars!”\nR.P., Big Lake, MN\n“Buck was the most knowledgeable tour guide for our trip around Nashville. He was entertaining and insightful. We were fortunate to have Buck lead us on our tour of Nashville. You will not be disappointed in the experience with Buck as your guide. Thank you so much!!”\nK.B., Batavia, IL\n“We traveled with a group of friends on the Nashville Evening Trolley Tour… Kerrie and our tour guide were fantastic on our tour. They were fun and energetic and made the entire 90 minutes entertaining and informative. Thank you for an amazing experience in a fabulous town!”\nK.Q., Indianapolis, IN\n“We had the BEST time on our Nashville Trolley with Drey. He taught us so much and also made us laugh numerous times. My kids (ages 12, 10, and 8) said that the trolley was the best part of our time in Nashville. We highly recommend the Trolley ride to anyone visiting Nashville and hope they can find a time when Drey is the guide.”\nT.M., Sterling, NY\n“We recently traveled to Nashville and took a day to enjoy your Trolley Service. We had a wonderful time. Our tour guides were great and our favorite was Big Cat. He was engaging and made us laugh. His jokes were hilarious. I have friends who will be traveling to Nashville in March and I have highly recommended your organization. Your buses are neat, clean and you employ some great staff who truly try to make the experience fun. I also would like to add that they were clear on the expectations of riding the trolley and Big Cat went above and beyond with explaining to passengers on the stops at the end of the day. I thought that information was so nice to ensure that passengers don’t become stranded and not have the explanation from the driver. We will go back to Nashville again and plan on using your service in the future. It was worth the money and honestly a good time was had by all. Thank you for this opportunity to share our thoughts. Have a wonderful day.”\nM.K., Rockville, MD\n“My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our tour of Nashville on the Old Town Trolley with Benji as our guide! He shared so much knowledge about the city with his guests! In addition, his personal adages about the city, added another level, and enriched the tour! Benji was smart, funny and engaging! His humor matched mine, so he kept me laughing and learning throughout! His driving was impressive too! So much traffic and obstacles to weave through. Benji is an asset to your team!”\nJ.H., Tobermory, OH\n“My husband and I have just returned from Nashville and we used Old Town Trolley Tours to get around and we just have to say that your driver Jules, or Julie was our absolute favorite driver that day. She gave all the necessary information with a great dash of her own humor and personality that made the trip so fun! Her love of the city of Nashville shone through each stop on the tour! We had a blast with Jules!”\nR.B., Milton, MA\n“My family and I enjoyed a tour of Nashville last week. Dave was our driver/guide. Dave was spectacular or should I say “SPECTACULAR” in describing the sights and history of your vibrant city. His enthusiasm was palpable.,Dave should be getting the compensation of your CEO but just don’t take him off of his trolley!”\nL.D., Southside, TN\n“Please give acknowledgement to ZACH and his Crew. He was AWESOME. I stared to cry when he acknowledged the African American History of Nashville. His crew was soo Patient with my 90 Year Old Mom. I have traveled often, and this was the Best Tour I have experienced in a Long Time. Thank him and his crew personally for me if possible. My Husband and I will take the tour SOON, hope it’s with ZACH, HE ROCKS!!!”\nC.H., Mandan, ND\n“I wanted to take the time to express our gratitude, and give a HUGE shout out to a few folks on our tour of Nashville. To start out Dave our driver and guide was a blast. He was a wealth of knowledge and made the ride fun and interactive. Our next driver was Ryan who did a great job keeping us safe. Our guide was Jimbo, who also had the history down to a ‘T’. It was a great tour with a great staff and we will be sure to do it again the next time we are in Nashville.”\nK.B., Haw River, NC\n“Good evening. I just wanted to take a minute and let you know about one of your employees. Debbie represents your company well. While in Nashville this past weekend we took the trolley tour. We had great tour guides but the best employee was Debbie. She was never our guide, but we ran into her at Chicken Guy during her lunch break. Because of her shirt and extremely friendly personality we struck up a conversation with her. Even while on her break, she was extremely helpful and friendly. We had such a bond with her we stopped by on Friday just to say hey and check in with her. You are extremely lucky to have an employee that represents you so well on and off the clock. Thank you for the tour and please tell Debbie her Chicken Guy friends greatly appreciate her hospitality.”\nN.W., St. Louis, MO\n“This is to say how much we enjoyed our ride with you this past Saturday. A BIG shout out to driver Dave who was a delight (we toured with some other good drivers, but Dave is a GEM!). Your company is a great way to see and learn about the Nashville spots of interest and get little tidbits of memorable information. My husband is a Vandy grad, but it has been a long time since I’ve been to Nashville, and wow have things changed in the years since. Dave mentioned a great spot near our hotel in The Gulch – the Station Inn – and a big highlight was seeing a concert there, and we would have missed it without Dave’s recommendation. We’re grateful for your fun and entertaining service!”\nL.A., Alachua, FL\n“I was just wondering how I could personally thank our tour guide Joshua on our Nashville tour this evening. He was so amazing I am overwhelmed with how much I enjoyed his personality and welcoming attitude. I learned so much compared to other tours where I lose interest.”\nL.J., Clarksville, TN\n“We had out of state family with us and decided to take the Nashville tour with your company. We waited for our trolley at stop 1 and got on. We were all greeted by Tony from Wisconsin. He was a phenomenal tour guide. Had a great personality and made the tour experience fun and memorable for everyone on board. People kept getting on but people didn’t want to get off until he had made his last stop before they changed out the driver. The entire bus emptied too. He is a great addition to Nashville and your tour company. Thank you.”\nS.C., Crystal City, MO\n“Took my first trolley tour for my first trip to Nashville. Brian “with an I” gave the tour and he did a phenomenal job. I enjoyed your stories and knowledge of Nashville. There was never a dull moment and I am boggled at how well you can drive and maneuver that huge bus in such tight turns. I have referred your company and Brian to everyone I have told about my trip! Thank you!”\nC.M, Minnesotta\n“My mother and I recently visited Nashville, TN, for the first time. We purchased a two day pass for the Old Town Trolly Tours and were not disappointed. It was recommended that we experience the whole tour first to get accustomed to the city, which we did for our first day.\nNelson, our tour guide, was amazing! He was very personable, knowledgeable, and great at keeping conversation going. His sense of humor kept us captivated and we enjoyed the whole experience.\nOn day two we had the pleasure of meeting Sam. Sam picked us up at Stop 8. He was very informative and we learned new facts on this second tour. Sam was charming, funny, and also very knowledgable.\nEveryone we ran into – from the lady who helped us activate our tickets at stop one on Saturday (she has really awesome rhinestone sunglasses) to the gentleman at stop one who helped us on Sunday were great. We really appreciated being able to see Nashville in a way that was informative and beneficial for individuals who might be less mobile.\nThanks for a great experience!”\nK.M., Vernon Hills, IL\n“Thank you very much for an excellent experience in Nashville! It was our first time there so the information we received on the tour was extremely helpful! Each guide had their own story and perspective on the city we now love so much! Each ride was on time and full of such valuable information it made our trip so much better than it would have been!  Although each guide was amazing, Gigi really did exceptionally well! Her suggestions for food, drink and shopping were on point! Exactly what we were looking for! Thank you for an awesome Nashville experience! We have been recommending the trolley to everyone headed your way! Thanks again!”\nW.M., East Syracuse, NY\n“Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by Tony, he asked our names, as well as our home towns. Tony then introduced us to the rest of the passengers on board and we felt welcomed with such a friendly atmosphere we had a fantastic start!… Our guide Tony was extremely good, very humorous (appreciate this!) and for that, he deserves a special thanks, we had a great day. Tony has such a warm personality and a highly motivated guide (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed the beautiful history of Nashville as well as the gorgeous scenery. Much appreciation and respect to Tony who does a great job; a true example of an excellent tour guide! Many thanks again and I recommend Tony to everyone!”\nC.B., Cincinnati, OH\n“This past weekend I had the privilege of taking a tour of Nashville with our driver and host T.J. Not only did he get us around the construction in the area but he was very insightful pointing out spots and attractions we wouldn’t have found on our own. He also had a great personality, tells really bad jokes and he loves his job and it showed!”\nJ.D., Gallatin, TN\n“We had a great experience with the Old Town Trolley folks on our Night Tour. Bret, our tour guide, was wonderful. He kept the whole bus entertained, informed, singing and was great at guiding us where we were to go and keeping everyone included on our stops. Mike, our experienced driver who got us through tight spots, was always extending a hand, with a smile, whenever we got on and off the bus, which I really appreciated. We will defiantly use the Old Town Trolleys again. Thanks”\nM.J., Lancaster, PA\n“I wanted to leave a positive response regarding the night tour and tour guide we had. Our sales team was in Nashville last week for a meeting and as a group we took the night tour on Wednesday. The tour was amazing and Nashville is an awesome town. But what made the tour so great was our guide; I believe her name is Lindsay. Her knowledge of the town, music industry, and excitement and energy made the tour a fantastic evening for our team. Please make sure she is recognized; she is a great asset to your organization. Our bus driver Mike also did a great job navigating the city streets and was very cordial, helping everyone young and old on and off the bus.”\nA.C., Elkton, KY\n“…The Night tour and the hop on hop off tours are both very good!! Sherri Lee was our night tour lady and Rusty the driver; both very helpful and polite. Chris, the day driver, was awesome and fun; both tours were Amazing!! We hated to see Chris get off to change drivers but understood. The history that you get is Great!!! very clean and tasteful tours; have already recommended to several people… Great job; prices are affordable and deals Great!!!”\nR.L.\n“We loved this tour!!! Perfect combo of comedy, history, views, music, and fun! Loved seeing the lights at night. Wonderful tour guide Sherri Lee and bus driver rusty. They worked well with each other and involved us in the comedy/fun! Highlight of our trip! Thanks!”\nB.A., Berkley, MI\n“My husband and I recently took a trolley tour in Nashville. Dunkin was our tour guide and he was wonderful. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining. He made the tour very enjoyable; we stayed on his trolley for the entire loop of the tour.”\nD.L.\n“To get away from the cold and snow of Michigan, my wife and I recently spent a few weeks meandering through Georgia, Florida and Tennessee. We went to Savannah first and the Visitor Center recommended taking an Old Town Trolley tour. It was the best thing we did as somebody who had never been to this beautiful and historic southern city. The guide was informative and entertaining and helped us see the highlights of Savannah and plan what we wanted to do once we got off the trolley.\nOur next stops were St. Augustine and Key West. We enjoyed the experience so much in Savannah that the first thing we did was get on your trolleys in both of these cities. While you are subject to the style and personality of the driver, and some were better than others, but on the whole, mostly good, the idea of seeing the highlights of a town before experiencing it on foot were well worth it each time. Our last stop was Nashville and, again, we learned a lot about the city through an Old Town Trolley before embarking on foot to get up close and personal.\nWe didn’t plan on going to four cities where Old Town Trolley operates, but after the Savannah experience, we kept getting on your trolleys and can’t say enough about how good they were for setting the stage for an enjoyable experience after getting off. I don’t think we would have embraced each of the cities as much if we hadn’t taken an Old Town Trolley tour first.\nI just want to tell you how good we think your tours are and how much we enjoyed them. We will certainly recommend them to any of our friends.”\nP.F., Roselle, IL\n“I just wanted to let your company know how much my husband and I really enjoyed the Tour with “Patty”. She was so informative and funny! Can’t wait to tour other towns with your company!”\nB.M., New York, NY:\n“My colleague and I were recently in Nashville for a convention and we took a trolley tour with Randy. He was an excellent tour guide!! Very funny, had a terrific knowledge of the city, and he made the trip quite educational AND enjoyable. Thank you, Randy! And I’ll be sure to recommend Old Town Trolley Tours to anyone I know who\nvisits Nashville\n.”\nK.W., Long Beach, NY:\n“Love the drivers!” Had several different drivers as we hopped on and hopped off… they were all equally awesome. They all knew the city and the history very well and were very funny and welcoming. Great way to\nexplore Nashville\nespecially when it’s hot and you don’t want to walk around all day. Highly recommend”\nR.C., Daytona Beach, FL:\n“We enjoyed the tour. Great information from guide. Very knowledgeable and great personality. We all had a fun tour as well.”\nK.K., Lambertville, MI:\n“Loved it! Learned so much about the city.”\nL.O., Hermon, ME:\n“A great service. Easily accessed guides were knowledgeable with a sense of humor. Answered all questions and gave us info on local eating establishments.”\nR.S., Newton, NJ:\n“An absolute must when one is\nnew to a city\nand has no idea where to go and how to get there. This is my 3rd in this country and I have taken them overseas in Paris and London. Just wonderful!”\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

AUGUSTINE?\nThe beautiful coastal city of St. Augustine is home to pristine beaches and centuries of history, offering visitors a unique and unforgettable experience. Read on for the top reasons to visit St. Augustine, the oldest city in the United States.\npost options\n<em class=\"title\"></em>\nAdmissions\nShopping\nDining\nEntertainment\nRestrooms\npost content\nDiscover the magic of wintertime in St. Augustine and embark on a historical “Transportainment\n®\n” adventure!\nAncient History\nSt. Augustine is brimming with nearly\n500 years of history\n. For those who wish to see it all and soak in as much of the city’s fascinating heritage as possible, a ride on the\nOld Town Trolley\nis a definite must do. The Old Town Trolley Tour takes you to all of the most important historic sights while allowing you to get off as often as you wish and spend as long as you want at each stop. There are 100 different points of interest on this comprehensive sightseeing tour including the\nFountain of Youth\n, the\nCity Gates\n, the\nSpanish Quarter\n, historic\nSt. George Street\n,\nCastillo de San Marcos\n,\nFlagler Memorial Presbyterian Church\n,\nGrace United Methodist Church\nand so much more.\nBeaches\nA St. Augustine vacation has to include a day or two at one or more of the city’s\nbeautiful beaches\n. There are various beaches to explore, each with its own majesty and personality. Crescent Beach offers a long, wide stretch of soft white sand, while Anastasia State Park provides a plethora of activities and adventure including swimming, windsurfing, paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing and more. There are many more exquisite beaches in the area including South Ponte Vedra Beach, Vilano Beach, St. Augustine Beach and North Beach.\nCastillo de San Marcos\nOne of the most significant historical structures in St. Augustine,\nCastillo de San Marcos\nis an awe-inspiring sight perched on the coast of the city. This massive fort was constructed by the Spanish between the years 1672 and 1695 and is the oldest masonry fortress in the United States. Constructed out of coquina, a form of limestone that was common in the area, the Castillo was used to protect the city from foreign invasions by sea. Today, visitors can tour the fort, walk through the hallways, see the walls that withstood many battles, witness canon firings and historical re-enactments and learn about the intriguing past of this imposing fortress.\nHenry Flagler\nHenry Flagler made his mark in St. Augustine as he did in many cities throughout Florida. It was his vision to create magnificent hotels that would draw in tourists from around the country to Florida. His influence remains throughout the city, including the Ponce de Leon Hotel, now\nFlagler College\n, and several other buildings such as the\nLightner Museum\nand the City Hall complex. Flagler, who was more than a visionary, worked his way from poverty to prosperity, ambitiously developing the Florida East Coast Railroad, building churches and more.\nToday, a visit to St. Augustine treats you to a view of his extraordinary talents and golden touch. You can also visit the\nMemorial Presbyterian Church\nand Mausoleum where Flagler, his wife, daughter and granddaughter are buried.\nSunshine and Blue Skies\nIt is Florida after all! So if you need a reason to visit the gorgeous city of St. Augustine, how about the fact that the weather is nearly perfect all year round? During\nsummer\n, you’ll enjoy warm and wonderful days for beach trips and for\nwinter\nthe weather is ideal for golf, relaxing, and touring the famous attractions.\nGreat Golf For Miles\nAlthough Florida is known for having luxurious golf resorts throughout the state, you can only find the World Golf Village and Hall of Fame in St. Augustine. The museum has 2 golf courses nearby which offer impeccable conditions and challenges around every corner. In addition to the World Golf Village, you’ll also find 10 other golf courses in the immediate vicinity and over 50 within 50 miles of St. Augustine including the world-renowned TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach.\nSt. Augustine Is Feeling The Love!\nTripAdvisor.com\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2024 Tripadvisor Travelers’ Choice Awards Winner\nNational Geographic Traveler\n•\nSt. Augustine recognized as one of the world’s 20 must-see places\nBest of St. Augustine\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2023 Best Guided Tour\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2022 Best Guided Tour\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2021 Best Guided Tour\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2019 Best Guided Tour\n•\nGhosts & Gravestones – 2019 Best Ghost Tour\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2019 Best St. Augustine Employer\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2017 Best Guided Tour\nFOLIO Weekly Magazine\n•\n2020 Best Trolley Tour in St. Augustine\nU.S. Department of Energy\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – Leader in reducing the nation’s dependence on imported oil\nSt. Johns County Chamber of Commerce\n•\nOld Town Trolley Tours – 2012 Member of the Year\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nYou may also like...\nBest Beaches In St. Augustine\nOld Town Trolley Tour\nNights of Lights Tours\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

When she’s not busy spreading warmth, you’ll find Debbie cozying up in Alkebu-Lan Images Bookstore, Nashville’s best-kept secret and a haven for bibliophiles since ’86!\nconductor\nconductor info\nDrey\nMeet Drey, the reigning Conductor of the Year 2023, whose confidence and warm wit assure guests daily that they are in good hands.

With a pun-stoppable vivacious energy, Drey leads the Conductor pack with a commitment to historical accuracy and puns that hit harder than that Music City twang!\nconductor\nconductor info\nHunter\nMeet Hunter, a Tennessee native, whose curiosity about history and adventure knows no bounds. He’s always wondered about Sacajawea’s brave journey into the unknown, leaving behind familiarity for the thrill of exploration. Hunter’s own adventures have taken him to awe-inspiring places, with Niagara Falls topping the list. And if you’re ever in town craving a quirky spot oozing with charm, Hunter suggests checking out Santa’s Pub for an unforgettable experience in Music City. You might meet Santa himself around the holidays!\nconductor\nconductor info\nHutch\nIntroducing Hutch, our resident historian’s historian.

Immerse yourself in the pages of a good book, for there’s no limit to the growth of the mind, and few things beat the serenity of a cozy reading session.\nconductor\nconductor info\nKyle\nMeet Kyle, our Lead Conductor, who’s as cool as a cucumber and never takes things personally. Our Kyle comes complete with a heart full of kindness and a positively duck-like ability to let negativity roll off his back. When he’s not spreading good vibes on the trolley, you’ll likely find him at Nashville’s “Dawg House,” enjoying live music and cheap beer with friends. And while he may not be the handiest with engines, Kyle’s safety record driving is pristine, and his willingness to stay positive while trying new things just adds to his charm!\nconductor\nconductor info\nLance\nMeet Conductor Lance, a proud Nashville native with a passion for the city’s rich history and landmarks.

Owen proves that growing up is optional, but being silly is mandatory!\nconductor\nconductor info\nRob\nMeet Conductor Rob, a laid-back homebody who finds solace in his garage man cave rather than the bustling hubbub of the city nightlife.

Rob’s gentle spirit and genuine curiosity make him a friendly presence wherever he goes.\nconductor\nconductor info\nRussell\nMeet Russell, who believes that the flavor of Music City lies in its vibrant blend of food, music, and most importantly, its people.

Like his namesake parted the Red Sea, he wants to lead guests into the unknown to show them the spirit of such a historic city.\nconductor\nconductor info\nNorth\nKayaki, “North,” a Cambridge native, has been working for OTT Boston since February 2023.

I grew up in Worcester, MA but have lived in Marblehead for over fifty years. I had a thirty-year career in the CAD/CAM industry, but since that devolved, I have had to reinvent myself; first as a salesman, then a professional ski instructor, a sail boat captain, a duck boat captain and now a trolley driver.

My three children attend Boston Latin School and my wife graduated from Harvard University, BA ’88.\nconductor\nconductor info\nUncle Steve\nIn 2002, “Uncle Steve” drove 20 miles from Brockton to apply for a part-time, evening job with OTT Boston, but they snookered him into working full-time. Five years later, he went looking for greener pastures, but the old saw proved true, so “Uncle Steve” returned in 2019. (He was surprised how much older his co-workers looked.) His hobbies are working for OTT, exploring New England, and working for OTT – in that order.\nAbout Us\nMeet Our Conductors\nScroll\nOur Conductors\nconductor\nAJ\nconductor\nAnthony “Tiger”\nconductor\nBeanie\nconductor\nBecca\nconductor\nChris W\nconductor\nCordelia\nconductor\nCrafty\nconductor\nDavid “Cubbie”\nconductor\nEber\nconductor\nGene “Bunker”\nconductor\nGonzo\nconductor\nHummer\nconductor\nJD\nconductor\nJennifer “J”\nconductor\nJohn “Irish”\nconductor\nJohn “Wylie”\nconductor\nJonathan “Thach”\nconductor\nJoshua\nconductor\nLaurent\nconductor\nMatty\nconductor\nMichael “Bear”\nconductor\nMoses\nconductor\nNorth\nconductor\nQuint\nconductor\nRachel “Rocky Waterfall”\nconductor\nRed\nconductor\nRuss “Mr. Kelley”\nconductor\nSalem\nconductor\nSkipper\nconductor\nSparkle\nconductor\nStephen “Turtle”\nconductor\nSuzanne “Miss Jackson”\nconductor\nTim “Murph”\nconductor\nUncle Steve\nScroll Down\nconductors text\nBack to Top",

Graham\nDecember 2012\nFlorida’s fountain of youth\nHistory books taught us that Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León “discovered” Florida 500 years ago in 1513 while seeking the fabled\nfountain of youth\n. But before the peninsula was claimed by de León, it was home for more than 12,000 years to Paleo-Indians who built civilizations around its water-filled sinkholes and left behind archaeologically rich middens (giant piles of oyster shells) as proof of their bayside existence.\nToday, finding a genuine slice of “Old Florida” can be a scavenger hunt. The breezy Spanish colonial city of St. Augustine is an exception to the rule. A pair of marble lions greets visitors crossing the regal Bridge of Lions into the walled city. Looming over it is\nCastillo de San Marcos\n, a 17th-century fort surrounded by a moat and occupied at various times by Spanish, British, Confederate, and U.S. soldiers. The fort’s warren of chambers echoes with the stories of pirates, three signers of the Declaration of Independence, Spanish-American War deserters, and even Seminole Chief Osceola, who was incarcerated here in 1837 for leading the native resistance against the U.S.\nAlong King Street sit historic Flagler College and the Lightner, an antiquities museum housed in an 1887 Spanish Renaissance Revival masterpiece. It was commissioned by oil tycoon Henry Flagler, who is credited with salvaging the city and planting Florida’s tourism seeds. St.\nGeorge Street\n, St. Augustine’s main drag, may have become overly touristy and crowded with T-shirt emporiums and fudge shops, but the side streets still harbor scrubby garden courtyards and off-the-radar bars, such as the 130-year-old Mill Top Tavern, where you can imagine what Old Florida was like before it became the Sunshine State.\nHow to Get Around\nThe Old Town Trolley narrated tour route encompasses 22 hop-on and hop-off sightseeing stops, plus a free shuttle to the beach and\nAlligator Farm\n.\nPurchase passes online.\nPonce de Leon treasures unveiled\nHistoric City News\nJune 7, 2010\nArchaeologist Raphael A. Cosme told Historic City News local reporters that he is proud to announce a new exhibit has opened featuring his private collection of Spanish colonial artifacts at the St. Augustine History Museum.\nThe exhibit entitled “Treasures of Juan Ponce de Leon and Domestic Life in Spanish Colonial St. Augustine” held its ribbon cutting ceremony before a crowd of spectators, including Cosme and his family, last Wednesday, June 2nd.\nEd Swift IV, Director of Operations of Old Town Trolley Tours, presented Cosme with an award of recognition for his dedication to archaeology, for the discovery of Juan Ponce de Leon artifacts and for promoting and preserving Hispanic colonial folklore.\nCosme has been researching and investigating Spanish colonial artifacts for the last 25 years. His finds include a comb carved out of bone, buttons, glass, coins dating from 1500 to 1630, cattle bones, and other inimitable pieces.\n“What makes this exhibit truly fascinating,” Cosme said, “is the fact that the site location of excavation could be the land boundary of Ponce de Leon’s temporary\nwooden house\n, which was built between 1519 and 1521.”\nThe St. Augustine History Museum, located at 167 San Marco Avenue, features a combination of historical displays and private collections that bring over 400 years of Florida history to life.\nCosme said that he is honored to have the opportunity to showcase his unique exhibit which is specifically intended to educate the general public on St. Augustine’s rich Spanish history. “Now the treasures of Juan Ponce de Leon will be accessible for public viewing.\nOld Town Trolley Wins Chamber of Commerce Member of the Year Award\nOn October 22, 2009, Old Town Trolley Tours of St. Augustine was awarded Member of the Year at the St. Johns County Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner, held at the beautiful Sawgrass Tournament Players Clubhouse in Ponte Vedra, Florida.\nSelected from 995 members, this was quite an honor, as it was presented in front of a large number of members. Mr. Don Wallis, Immediate Past Chair of the Chamber, made the presentation and thanked us for all of our help in the past several years with their Leadership St. Johns program for which we have provided transportation services.\nDave Chatterton, General Manager, accepted the award on our behalf, and Stacey Jackson, Office Manager, and Cindy Stavely, Director of Sales, were also in attendance.\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

Chris Belland, Ed Swift, and Moe Mosher first worked together restoring the historic storefronts of Duval Street in the heart of Key West. As visitors began to flock to Key West, there was an increased interest in the colorful history of the town.\npost options\npost content\nRecognizing this as an opportunity to tell Key West’s story, the three partners formed Old Town Trolley Tours, a tour company that both informs and entertains its guests.\nWhen\nOld Town Trolley Tours\nfirst started out, the company consisted of a converted bread truck with a homemade trailer. As the tours became more popular, the company was able buy a new fleet of trolleys, which was launched in 1980. Over the next year, more than 70,000 passengers toured Key West with Old Town Trolley.\nAs Chris, Ed, and Moe traveled the country, admiring the architecture and history of many of America’s great cities, they were inspired to expand their business. Starting with Boston and eventually adding St. Augustine, San Diego, Savannah, Nashville, San Antonio, Washington, DC, and Charleston. Old Town Trolley Tours now boasts over 190 trolleys in 9 cities.\nThough the company has grown, its mission to help visitors “See the Best First” has stayed the same. Along with a commitment to quality, Old Town Trolley combines history, fun facts, colorful anecdotes, and outstanding service to provide their guests with a memorable vacation experience.\nOur Company Join\n“Join us in any of our great cities and see why our guests say we offer “the best sightseeing tours in the country!”\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp\nOur Company Join\n“Join us in any of our great cities and see why our guests say we offer “the best sightseeing tours in the country!”",

With our use of clean burning propane, we’ve been committed to preserving and protecting the environment since we began delighting guests across the United States with our wonderful brand of Transportainment\n®\n.\npost options\npost content\nWE’RE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY\nPropane – the fuel of our fleets and the future\nWe take our devotion to the environment so seriously that we converted 90% of our fleet to run on propane instead of gasoline. In fact, Old Town Trolley Tours was recently recognized by the Propane Industry with the Propane Exceptional Energy Fleet Award for our use of propane in our orange and green trolleys. Propane is a great alternative to gasoline because it burns cleaner, is safer, more cost effective and all around better for the environment.\nOne trolley means less is more\nYou may have noticed on the back of our trolleys the bumper sticker that reads “one trolley = 20 cars”. That’s because our trolleys not only offer people an entertaining, informative way to see cities across the country, they also reduce the amount of cars driving on the roads. And with fewer cars, there’s less pollution, a decrease in fuel consumption and less traffic. All of this makes a valuable impact on the environment.\nToday, tomorrow and beyond\nAt Old Town Trolley Tours, we’re determined to do our part as a responsible corporate citizen to ensure the welfare of the environment. And our commitment is unwavering. Today and tomorrow and into the future, we plan on continuing with what we started over 30 years ago. That means that our company will consistently utilize new and innovative ways to improve the world we live in. So keep an eye out for our energy efficient, environmentally friendly trolleys and hop on board – they’re a breath of fresh air.\nWater-Soluble Guest Stickers\nWe’re always looking for ways to be more environmentally friendly and reduce our impact on the communities we serve. That’s why we’re excited to implement water-soluble stickers for identifying our guests at our stops throughout the city. We understand that our guest stickers tend to end up where they don’t belong, so we wanted to invest in a more sustainable solution that aligns with our commitment to the environment. These stickers are not only useful for conductors to keep track of guests, but they also dissolve when exposed to water, preventing litter and keeping our cities green. Small actions like this can make a big difference on the planet, and we’re proud to set an example for all to follow!\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

AUGUSTINE REVIEWS\nWhat Our Guests are Saying\npost options\npost content\nJ.R., Ocean Breeze, FL\n“Amazing Tours! The best that I’ve been on. Particularly Patrick at the Old Jail and Orville at the Oldest Store Museum. Their depth of knowledge was extraordinary and their sense of humor silly and fun. They were both EXCELLENT! Worth every penny and we had a blast. Already recommended it to my folks who will be in St. Augustine in March!”\nJ.B., Palm Bay, FL\n“Kit Kat did an excellent job on our first part of our tour. Very knowledgeable and funny. Made the tour interesting. My 6-year-old daughter even stayed quiet and took in the information. I am a teacher and always enjoy the tour as I learn something new every time! Never gets old! Great job!!”\nK.G., Pilot Knob, MO\n“I wanted to leave a review of our trolley tour. The tour was awesome, we loved all of the things we got to see, and it really helped us acclimate to all of the things in St. Augustine we could see and visit. Our tour guide Summer was amazing, she knew her stuff and was funny and entertaining! We loved her, and couldn’t have asked for a better guide and driver. Kudos Summer and thank you for making our experience so great! Will definitely do it again next time we go to St. Augustine!”\nU.U., Naperville, IL\n“Went on day two of our package in St Augustine. Had Kit Kat as our tour guide and she was so funny and informative. Very engaging! We had several tour guides over the course of the two days, but we are very happy to report that our trip ended on a high note with Kit Kat. Thank you so much from Chicago!”\nM.L., Orlando, FL\n“Just wanted to reach out & say that Fran is a huge asset to the team at the Old Jail. Of course, we only just met him yesterday evening, but you can see a lot of passion that he has & he very much made our experience 100x better (and it was already really really great). Thanks again!”\nB.T., Caledonia, MN\n“We were a group of 6 that did the tour on New Year’s Eve. We had Summer as our driver and she was AMAZING!! We enjoyed her stories and her attitude very much. We saw her driving a bus around a couple days later and was very kind when we said her name and waved from the sidewalk. We talked about her and her tour our whole trip.”\nH.D.J.\n“We bought a package deal with attractions and trolley. After finishing up the attractions at the trolley station we decided to take the rest of the time to sight see all the stops the trolley offered around town. Our trolley tour guide Preacher was wonderful! He was so polite, friendly, and animated it just made us want to stay on for the whole trip around. That’s exactly what we did. We thought of maybe getting off to one or two more attractions but it was nice and relaxing not to mention entertaining to stay on. Preacher took us on an adventure all around and even as he had to detour for some traffic complications he kept a happy and bright demeanor giving us history and information of everything in sight along the way. Towards the end of the trip it began to drizzle rain and he stopped the trolley to pass out free ponchos to every single guest aboard. To end the evening on a fun note he even took us to see the peacocks at the\nfountain of youth\nand we got to watch them come out for some peanut snacks which was quite amazing especially for our little one, she got a kick out of seeing all the beautiful birds! If your hopping on and off or taking the full trip, try to catch a ride with the Preacher! He is the best, you won’t regret it!!”\nJ.G., Winter Haven, FL\n“Just wanted to let you know about two great experiences we had with your guides on March 25. We decided to take the trolley tour during the day, best decision we made all week. We were lucky enough to have Irish as our guide. Excellent guest interaction and extremely safe operation of the vehicle. That very same night, we took the 9pm Ghosts and Gravestones tour with Max as our guide. Another great experience! Max was very personable and gave a great tour! Our driver Will rounded out the experience. We will be back and we will use your services again.”\nA.M., Glenside, PA\n“We had to write to tell you in everything we did; we had the most amazing tour guides. Birdy brought the jail to life to my surly teenage daughter who wanted to be elsewhere. Preacher and the Ragin Cajun each shared something new as we took the trolley around St. Augustine that made history not quite so boring for family! The Old Jail After Dark with Bill was to die for! Whether our photos show evidence of paranormal activity or not, he made the night come alive for my mother and daughter. But the highlight of our trip was a throw away visit we didn’t intend to enjoy so much. We weren’t sure we would take the Old Store tour, but it was included and we are killing time, so… From the moment we met Molly on the porch until she left us to wander through the store room on our own she had our undivided attention. She brought a smile to my teenage daughter’s face (she hates history and is only here to please her grandmother, but even she LOVED Molly!). If they give awards for vacation saving, Molly deserves two (or to have them named after her!). Rest assured we will look for you in the next city we visit. Thank you again!”\nB.R., Moline, IL\n“We rode your trolley the weekend before Christmas in St Augustine. We rode during the daytime and Kanga was our driver/guide. To say that she made the tour would be an understatement. She was amazing! The entire tour was really cool, but her narration really made it special. We have returned home, and life is back to normal, but the memories we made down there will always be with us. The trolley tour especially. Rest assured that every chance we get to come back we will, and the trolley will be among our stops. Hopefully we’re able to ride with Kanga again. If there is a spot to give her a rating please give her the highest possible from us. Thanks for a special day.”\nK.S., Miami, FL\n“I just wanted to leave a note about a fantastic staff, including our driver, Jim. But in specific I want to mention a specific person who truly made our trip extraordinary and one who I will always remember. His name is Charles and he’s from Tennessee. He was just so friendly and nice and gave me great ideas for places to see while on the tour and in the city. He is very knowledgable on all topics and made my 10 minute wait for the trolley some of the most memorable minutes I have spent with someone in a long time. I’m not trying to sound weird, but I mention this because I want you all to know how valuable and genuine Charles is. He is such a pleasant and knowledgeable and passionate person for what he does. If there is anyone who embraces good business and values, and can be a truly illustrious employee of the year-type, a model-employee person, Charles is the man. Please reward him accordingly and make sure he is aware that his ways are noticed.”\nM.B., Panama City, FL\n“Three adults in my party took the Old Town Trolley Tours and visited the S.A. History Museum. We had an enjoyable good time and have recommend you already. We have about six adult family members visiting in the next 30-45 days. The following comments will reference our tour guide “Summer”. Ms. Summer is the model tour guide. She should be the measurement for evaluation of all the other guides. Ms. Summer was loud enough to be heard, but not too loud. She was clear and concise. Her knowledge and sense of humor is noteworthy. If my family and I decide to do this tour again, and we have talked about it, it will be imperative to seek out Summer again. She is a great asset too your firm. And her name is ding, ding, SUMMER! Loved every moment of it.”\nA.C., Kissimmee, FL:\n“Wow best money spent on my trip! Talked to the lady at stop 3 and got our tickets and a few added stop tickets. We hit 3 different tour guides Robert the Pirate, Allie Cat, and Summer. All were amazing friendly and informative. I assume they have to memorize things but the way each one spoke and talked was different and made the trolley even better. Thank you and wanted to brag about how great they were and how they helped make our visit even more amazing!!!!!”\nD.W., Bayou Vista, TX:\n“My husband and I visited St. Augustine recently and your trolley tour was the only reason we were able to experience so much of the town in such a short time. Thank you…”\nB.M., Virginia Beach, VA:\n“My wife and I recently spent a week in St. Augustine, FL. We wanted to commend your company on an outstanding job!! Every aspect of your operation there was enjoyable. From the trolley rides to the venues that you operated. She and I constantly talked about how TTA should move in to the Williamsburg/Jamestown/Yorktown area of Virginia, It would be a fantastic fit. Thanks again for an awesome week!!!”\nS.K., Ocala, FL:\n“We had a great time with this tour. From purchasing our tickets to taking the trolley. Troy was our guide. He was wonderful, full of info and was a good driver. Very considerate of his passengers and other drivers. He gets 5 stars from us. Thank you.”\nL.D., Dahlonega, GA:\n“Oz was amazing! He was so informative and funny – and I loved hearing all that he had to say! He kept talking the whole time and he never sounded like he was tired of giving the info. I could have listened to him all day and loved everything he said. Great job to Oz!!!”\nM.R., McDonough, GA:\n“We want to thank Scooter.. we arrived here n St. Augustine on Monday and attempted to cross the street from our hotel to welcome center. In our attempt to cross the street, purchased our tickets, and were ready to cross the street again… we met Scooter who offered us a safe ride to our hotel… very much appreciated since the skies opened and torrential rain fell. Tuesday, we started our journey, with a call for a pickup at our hotel to a smiling Scooter! We were thrilled, he is so passionate about his job and history. As we drive to Stop 1, we felt the tour already started.  We walked around stop 1 for about 45 minutes, go to our tour bus… Scooter! We remained on the ride for all the stops and thoroughly enjoyed the tour! Scooter’s insightful historical knowledge and humor made it a wonderful day! As we got off Scooter offered us a ride back to our hotel, on the way we were able to ‘pick his brain’ about restaurants, etc…. Scooter has made our trip enjoyable and look forward to today’s journey.”\nN.H., Titusville, FL:\n“I just wanted to express how awesome our experience was with Old Town Trolley Tours. Every single tour guide we had (Approximately 6 throughout our time) was awesome! However, I wanted to give a HUGE shout out to Barb! She was amazing, so knowledgeable and friendly. We had just gotten engaged on a\nhorse and carriage ride\nand were getting on a shuttle from stop 1 to our hotel – She was absolutely wonderful, so personable and congratulated us as she noticed the flowers. The rest of the weekend, every time she saw us – She congratulated and remembered us! We truly felt special. However, it was not only us that she remembered, she remembered other guests and things about them on the trolley as well, all while being SO extremely professional, friendly and knowledgeable on the area. I cannot brag about her enough. The whole trolley experience was wonderful, however it is tour guides, like Barb, that will keep us using your trolley service every time we visit St. Augustine!”\nD.L.\n“To get away from the cold and snow of Michigan, my wife and I recently spent a few weeks meandering through Georgia, Florida and Tennessee. We went to Savannah first and the Visitor Center recommended taking an Old Town Trolley tour. It was the best thing we did as somebody who had never been to this beautiful and historic southern city. The guide was informative and entertaining and helped us see the highlights of Savannah and plan what we wanted to do once we got off the trolley.\nOur next stops were St. Augustine and Key West. We enjoyed the experience so much in Savannah that the first thing we did was get on your trolleys in both of these cities. While you are subject to the style and personality of the driver, and some were better than others, but on the whole, mostly good, the idea of seeing the highlights of a town before experiencing it on foot were well worth it each time. Our last stop was Nashville and, again, we learned a lot about the city through an Old Town Trolley before embarking on foot to get up close and personal.\nWe didn’t plan on going to four cities where Old Town Trolley operates, but after the Savannah experience, we kept getting on your trolleys and can’t say enough about how good they were for setting the stage for an enjoyable experience after getting off. I don’t think we would have embraced each of the cities as much if we hadn’t taken an Old Town Trolley tour first.\nI just want to tell you how good we think your tours are and how much we enjoyed them. We will certainly recommend them to any of our friends.”\nD.B., UK\n“My wife and I took the St. Augustine Old Town Trolley Tour today. Our driver/guide was Batman. What a great guide. He kept us enthralled for the 70 minute tour, despite it being bitterly cold today. After the tour we walked the same route, benefiting from the wonderful historical information that Batman had imparted to us. Many thanks for a great service – we always use Trolley Tours to “research” a new US town when we first visit. A great way to get to know it quickly and to find the places worthy if a closer look.”\nJ.C., Cape Coral, FL\n“My wife and I were in St. Augustine yesterday and in Savannah today. Major Tom was our guide throughout the tour at St. Augustine and Denise was our driver/guide at Savannah throughout. Both guides totally made both days an absolute delight! Wonderful personalities,witty, intelligent and so knowledgeable about their cities making this two WONDERFUL days on our vacation. Love Old Town Trolleys!”\nT.M, Ebensburg,, PA\n“Our group of eight just spent 2 days in St. Augustine… best thing we did was buy 2 day passes for you trolleys. We could not have been more pleased with your services and how helpful and entertaining all of your staff were to us… Well done by all!!! Don’t know what you folks feed these people for Breakfast, but I want some! Thank you all for a very enjoyable trip.”\nR.H., New Port Richey, FL\n“My family and I went for a weekend trip to St. Augustine and toured many of your local attractions. I have to say that two people stood out. Mr. Ungrie and your “Jail Tour” was terrific and very patient with questions and was a wonderful person and very knowledgeable of his job and surrounding attractions. As well, Rif, your trolley tour driver was excellent and outstanding, as well, in his customer service and knowledge of his job. We had a wonderful time and my 83-year-old mother will be here next month and I assure you we will travel and come back to St. Augustine and use your services once again. Fantastic time… Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my family’s “quick getaway” a time to remember. Please give a special thank you to Rif and Mr. Ungrie.”\nV.A., Jacksonville, FL\n“I wanted to pass on my thanks for a job well done by one of your employees. My sister was visiting me from Texas and she wanted to ride the Old Town Trolley to see St. Augustine but due to her handicap she could not step up and board the Trolley. We were at the old gateways to the city where the trolley stops. The attendant for your company by the name of William was very sensitive to our plight. He contacted someone and they came and picked us up and took us to another station where there was a trolley that would accommodate her handicap. The trolley ride was the highlight of her trip thanks to William and how wonderfully he handled our situation. He thinks about his customers and went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful experience. Also, Ms. Florida our guide was very good. She was so knowledgeable about the city. I learned so much and I have been coming to St. Augustine for years. I will forever use Old Town when I have out of town guests come to visit. Thanks again for employing such wonder caring people.”\nV.K., Wesley Chapel, FL\n“It is rare that I take the time to write a comment. However, your staff and service was so outstanding it warrants the effort. After being left standing in the rain by your competitor at the Old Jail, your employees did everything in their power to help us and to get us on the next trolley. There were 14 of us, and it was pouring down rain, so this was no small feat.Then, we originally were just going to ride to the next “indoor” activity, but your driver Jeff made it so much fun to be on the trolley that we figured, “Oh, well, we’re already wet!” and we stayed on for the whole tour of St. Augustine. With us was a fourth grade class with parents, from a small, Christian school in Tampa, and when I asked the students to name their favorite part of the trip, they said, in unison, “Jeff!” and the trolley. Thank you for turning what could have otherwise been a drab, disastrous day into a “last hurrah” before going back to Tampa. They say that attitude reflects leadership, and I must say the attitudes of your employees should make you proud!”\nK. & L. P., Port St. Lucie, FL\n“Jerry is the best driver and most amazing addition that we have met on your team! He genuinely cares about the people that he transports and makes the time to ask about where they are from, etc, but also cares enough to remember them. Jerry felt like family by the time we were finished with our vacation. Having a team that is as amazing and customer friendly is a blessing, but having a member of that team like Jerry is a true blessing. No matter where we visit in St. Augustine, we will make our way back to the Old Jail parking lot or call and request Jerry to pick us up. Thank you for sharing him with everyone. He is truly an asset.”\nK.G., Maryville, TN\n“We visited St. Augustine and rode your trolley there many times. Your guides were very knowledgeable, entertaining and helpful. On the last day, we got off the trolley in downtown St. Augustine to see a site and soon realized that it was probably the last one of the day. My wife has knee problems and walking back to our car would have been difficult for her. One of your employees called your dispatcher, and about 20 minutes later a shuttle appeared to take us back to our car. We were really impressed by your service. Thank you so much.”\nB.T., Naples, FL\n“Our family visited St. Augustine over the weekend. Your tour guides and our ticket agent (at stop 19 I think – next to Ripleys) are definitely to be commended. One great vacation and your company associates were fantastic. I have forgotten the ladies name at the ticket office but our drivers were Mack and Juan. A mark of satisfaction is referrals and repeat business. You got it!”\nJ.F., Sarasota, FL\n“We had the pleasure of visiting St. Augustine and Old Town Trolley Tours was a highlight of our trip. The conductors are wonderful, and their expert narration was a delight. Truly educational AND entertaining. We’d like to give a special shout out to John, our Beach Bus conductor, who is a sweetheart! Thank you OTT …you will see us, again!”\nJ.C., Hilton head, SC\n“Just wanted to thank your courteous staff for making our trip of Saint Augustine memorable. We arrived late on Sunday afternoon and was told by our ticket seller Kevin that we could make the last tour. We were disappointed to find that we had actually missed the last tour when we arrived at the Old Jail. Your nice employee Steve saw to it that we received a private ride and our guide Michael stayed on after his regular shift to give us our tour. We got to see more than the regular tour and enjoyed our question and answer session with your knowledgeable guide Michael. Thank you Michael for staying after hours to make sure we had a good time! We will recommend your company to others and will return. I look forward to taking the paranormal tour that Michael told us about. Thank you for giving us that little extra!”\nC.K., Bradenton, FL\n“We so enjoyed our visit to your city last week. The fireworks were wonderful and the way we were treated there by your staff was so nice. Of all the places we have visited this summer, the treatment that we received there in St. Augustine was the best. Your staff there made us feel at home. I want to especially thank the following: Gerry for giving us a friendly hello each day when picking us up at our hotel, Steve who made sure we were greeted when we arrived and Michael who gave us a great tour each day and recognized us by waving every time he saw us walking down the sidewalk. These small things may seem small but they made our trip memorable. All there at your company made this memory for us possible. Thank you again for all the special touches!!”\nI.H., Sebastian, FL\n“Just returned from a weekend in St. Augustine and wanted to thank Old Town Trolley Tours for making our trip such a memorable one. First of all, buying the tickets ahead online was great. The discounts you offer are wonderful. But, it’s the trolley tours staff that will keep us coming back again and again. Everyone we had the pleasure to deal with were knowledgeable, enthusiastic and kind. In particular, we got to have one-on-one time with Pat and Steve. Pat drove our shuttle from our hotel to the Old Jail and back again. He welcomed us to town and answered all our questions. He set the tone for the entire trip. We were also able to have some one-on-one time with Steve, who took us to the beach side on the bus. Not only was he helpful and friendly with us, but with everybody who boarded the bus. Last, but certainly not least was Mitch. We were lucky enough to catch his trolley several times. He is knowledgeable, kind and FUNNY. We really enjoyed being on his route. He has a way of making everyone feel welcome and “part of the experience” (part of the “show”). When you work in customer service, especially in the tourist trade, and you have to answer the same questions over and over again, I’m sure it can get tedious; however, no one on your staff ever makes you feel that way. Everyone is kind, patient and helpful. You feel like you’re the most important person or the only person who ever asked that question. We’ll be back in St. Augustine in December and we will be sure to use Old Town Trolley Tours once again. Thank you for making our experience a pleasurable one and congratulations on a job well done.”\nC. & J.B., Roswell, GA\n“Michael was very entertaining with stories of Henry Flagler and his wives. He knew many details and was obviously very well read. Comfortable ride with him and he stood out from the rest! We loved his unique touring style!”\nK.M., Beaufort, SC\n“We were so delighted to be given such nice treatment from your company during our stay. We arrived in the pouring rain last week and we were not in the best of moods. Your conductor Michael changed that very quickly for us. He told us that days like this are always remembered and it was! I do not know how he has learned all of the history that he knows but we were very impressed. We have ridden with your company in Washington, Savannah and in Key West. This guide was exceptional! He even allowed some of your competitor’s riders to ride because he felt sorry for them waiting for their train in the heavy rain. What a gentleman!! I have never experienced southern hospitality as I did in St. Augustine last week. The tropical rain did little to dampen our spirits after riding with Michael and the other guides in St. Augustine. It was a completely wonderful trip, in spite of the driving rain, due to your staff in St. Augustine!”\nS.S., Bordentown, NJ\n“My mom and I enjoyed our trolley experience tremendously! It went off without a hitch! The guides were all very informative and really added to the sightseeing experience. We were able to see and do so much more because of the trolley. We were also pleased to see that you have wheelchair accessible options, as next time we will be traveling with a wheelchair user. We have already recommended you to several people. Old Town Trolley Tours really made our whole trip!”\nD.K., Miami Lakes, FL\n“I have never enjoyed myself so much. The Guides were not only very entertaining, but extremely educated on the area. Each one had a little more to add. I left some pictures with the old jail booth from our first trip. Love It. B Back Soon, Thank You.”\nS.J. DeBary, FL\n“We have ridden the trolleys many times and Gaines was definitely one of the best. He was extremely knowledgeable, easy to understand, humorous, very polite and totally enthusiastic about the positive aspects of the city. His pride of St. Augustine was obvious.”\nJ & C.C Waterloo, Ontario\n“Roni was the best guide we had all day. Polite, very easy to understand, good pronunciation … she knows her stuff. Give her a raise.”\nV.R. Inverness, FL\n“The historical information that Lt. Donn gave us was great. He was also very friendly and funny. We will be back.”\nA.B.\n“We visited St. Augustine in early September and thoroughly enjoyed the tour, especially the ability to hop on and off throughout the day. The knowledge of the guides (we had Bob, Angel and Jay) was better than some other places we have visited … I recommend it if you either have kids with you, or are still a big kid at heart.”\nI.P. Indiantown, FL\n“Bob was an excellent tour guide. He was clear speaking and very informative. We truly enjoyed our time on the trolley.”\nJ & L.H. Florence, SC\n“Friar Bob was exceptional. We’ve used your tour before and we’ve always enjoyed it. This guide was especially good.”\nD.H. Benicia, CA\n“Charlie is a wonderful guide. He is very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a delight to ride with him.”\nM.M. Palm Springs, FL\n“David from Maine was our guide. This man was wonderful. I wish we had employees like him. Don’t ever let him go!!!”\nE.C., Charleston, SC\n“I never knew that there were so many connections between my city and St. Augustine. This humble guide of yours descends from two of our most distinguished families here in Charleston: the Savages and the Pickneys. You have a real jewel on your staff! We would love to have him back here in Charleston when you are finished! He has become a wonderful ambassador to your city, as he was for ours! We completely enjoyed our three days riding with Michael and learning not only about St. Augustine, but also our own city Charleston.”\n“Just want to say how impressed we were with everyone. We were there last week for 3 days. From the moment you arrive at the Old Jail you sense the enthusiasm and love for their job. We had about 6 of your trolley drivers and they were all excellent. It made the trip really special. Great teamwork. God bless them all! ”\nM.G., Jamison, PA\n“You have one of the Best websites we have encountered. It is easy to navigate and is not “clogged” with non-related information.”\nJ.J., Mt. Washington, KY\n“John A. was the driver of the bus that picked us up at the Hampton Hotel on the beach and he was a great driver; enjoyed him so much; we went on the tours for 3 days… just want you to know he is a very good driver and sure made us glad we took your tours.”\nC.W., Sarasota, FL\n“Michael is a real GEM! I enjoyed every minute of his tour. I rode the trolley all over town for three days and he was the best guide. Now I want to return to St. Augustine and bring all my friends to ride the trolley.”\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

He joined the cast then as a Ghost Actor/MOD. He fell in love with the character he developed within that role; that love quickly grew to the Boston operation as he moved into several different roles over the following years, ‘and the rest is history.’ Tim is ecstatic to be in his current role of always being “on stage” and is excited to help Boston operate at its fullest potential of being Boston’s ‘Storyteller.’ Tim lives in Arlington, MA with his wife and loves to spend time with her hiking in Vermont or walking the beaches of Maine.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAgnes\nGhosts & Gravestones Gravedigger\nWhen “Agnes” turned 30 in 1898, she knew the only way she could attain a marriage proposal was with academic achievements. Though her intelligence was lacking, she made up for it with bludgeoned professors and plagiarized papers. And it worked! A little too well… Now in death, Agnes is cursed to work in the least prestigious industry possible…ghost tourism. But hey, at least she is doing what she was so good at in life – taking other people’s stories and presenting them as her own!\nconductor\nconductor info\nAlanna\nAdministrative Assistant\nAlanna grew up in Lawrence, MA, and joined OTT as an administrative assistant in 2024. Alanna’s husband JD has driven for OTT since 2011, so she joined to see what all the fuss was about! Alanna is a dilettante in the silly arts: paint-by-numbers, standup comedy, and software development.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAldwin\nDetailer\nBorn and raised in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. I enjoy reading, watching sports, movies and I love classical music. I love apples, bananas, blueberries, potatoes, plantains, and yucca to name a few. My all-time favorite song is “We are the World” by USA for Africa.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAllison\nSales Representative\nOriginally from Connecticut, Allison has lived in Salem Massachusetts, and moved to Boston in 2020. She has been at Old Town Trolley Boston since April 2023 and is currently a Sales Rep. She has worked in Salem as a walking tour guide and managed a museum and an aquarium gift shop.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAmy “Mary”\nActor\nBorn and raised in Sonoma County, California, where I became a part of the chipping under the oakwood, the Northern California, Renaissance Faire. Then I moved to Alaska for four years before choosing New England as my home. My man and I live on a small farm where we raise silkie chickens. Our two goofball Roodles (half Rottweiler, half poodle) keep us safe from the encroaching hordes of squirrels.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAndrew\nSales Representative\nAndrew arrived on Old Town Trolley’s Doorstep in 2001! He had quit his boring job at Blockbuster Video to work as a Colonial Actor on The Boston Tea Party Ship. He eventually transferred to Sales at OTT, the job he has today. Andrew loves working with our CAST while selling our attractions to guests from around the world.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAnesti\nDetailer\nAnesti came to Boston in 1996 with his family from Albania. He has two incredible children and a beautiful granddaughter named Paris. Anesti has been with HTA since 2001, working in our Maintenance Department – ensuring our trolleys are sparkling clean every day.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAriel\nSales Representative\nAriel is a creative person who likes to improvise and have fun. They have a very chipper personality and likes to greet others with a smile, willing to lend a hand to someone, if needed. A modern artist with colorful views and a fan of history as well as science. As they grow to become greater in their field of vision, they wish to one day get to see more of the world, other countries in which they meet people that come around on a daily basis. Someday, that dream will come true for them.\nconductor\nconductor info\nArthur\nGhosts & Gravestones Gravedigger\n“Arthur Preston” was the dashing ringmaster of a stupendous traveling circus. But his career came to an untimely end when the cast of the Freak Show—performers who he’d personally mutilated and disfigured—broke free from their cages and took their revenge. Step right up, and maybe he will let you join the show.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAspen\nLead Actor\nAspen is a current resident of Gloucester, and has called nearly 5 different states home – but Massachusetts is truly where the heart is. Aspen has a beautiful wife, a wonderful daughter, and too many animals to count. (The cat, Spooky, is the favorite. Don’t tell the others.) When Aspen is not haunting the streets of Boston (or the local Taco Bell), you can find her occasionally hosting a karaoke night, attending a drag brunch, or as a practicing LMT. “Today I define success by the fluidity with which I transcend emotional land mines and choose joy and gratitude instead.” – RuPaul\nconductor\nconductor info\nAtticus\nGhosts & Gravestones Gravedigger\n“Doctor Atticus Nobody” was a prodigiously renowned physician and alchemical scholar, who became infamous for his morally dubious research. His quest for immortality ended with tragic results, trapping him in a flawed immortal body plagued by hellish visions upon each consecutive demise. This perpetual cycle has come at the cost of both sanity and surname, rendering him both mad and predisposed to work in tourism.\nconductor\nconductor info\nAttucks\nSales Representative\nHi, my name is Attucks. I am from Lisbon, Portugal. I moved to Boston years ago. I love our amazing city and spend a lot a time navigating and discovering more about it. I am currently concentrating on finally going back to college and finishing my Psychology degree. I have worked as a Dunkin Donuts Store Manager, an Interpreter, and I am loving working for Old Town Trolley Tours. I love sports and love learning new things. Something fun about me is that I can enjoy Eros Ramazzotti the same way I would enjoy Drake. I just love music.\nconductor\nconductor info\nBalthazar\nFleet Mechanic\nBorn and raised in Boston. I always have my cell phone and a chapStick in my pocket. I enjoy a great picnic by the water where I envision the author Robert Greene would write my life story. What is Boston’s best-kept secret? Most don’t know that Fenway grows its own vegetables. That is an innovative way to use 1800 sq. feet of dead space. Fenway Farms supplies produce for EMC level.\nconductor\nconductor info\nBeth\nVendor Sales Representative\nBeth started at Old Town Trolley Tours of Boston as a conductor in 2004. Later that year, she moved into the Vendor Sales Representative position. She is proud to work for a company that is so well respected and represented in the tour industry. In her free time, she enjoys watching her kids’ soccer matches and taking long walks with her husband and their dog.\nconductor\nconductor info\nBob\nCommercial Fleet Manager\nBob has been an ASE Master Technician since the age of 18. He worked most of his life as a flat-rate mechanic for Oldsmobile & Chevrolet dealerships. He came to OTT in 2005 and heads up our maintenance and mechanical departments.\nconductor\nconductor info\nCharlize\nActor\nHey I’m Charlize! I use they/them pronouns and am from Ipswich, Massachusetts, though now residing in the Boston area for school! I’m a musical theater major at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee and am currently in my junior year. I’m currently trying to become a puppeteer because I grew up watching so many tv shows as a kid that were FILLED with puppets (i.e., Between the Lions, Bear in the Big Blue House, The Muppets, Sesame Street, etc.). And a fun fact is that I have hidden multiple cardboard cut outs throughout my apartment for people to find; my favorite is the large Tinky Winky head 🙂\nconductor\nconductor info\nChris\nLead Detailer\nMusic lover, I work as a radio DJ & also as a mobile DJ for various events. Huge sports fan and animal lover. Love football, baseball or going to a good metal or rock concert. I also enjoy relaxing with some video games or playing my guitar.\nconductor\nconductor info\nChris C\nSales Representative\nFrom Charlestown, MA. An OTT sales rep, hired in 2010 and again in 2019. Studied Car Design in San Francisco and in Los Angeles, California. Chris is currently pursuing music, specifically percussion.\nconductor\nconductor info\nDarren\nSales Representative\nDarren has lived in Cambridge, MA for the past 4 years. Originally from Virginia Beach, VA. Boston’s Best Kept Secret: Samuel Adams Brewery and the Seaport District, lived there for a year. The Brightest Smile of Boston, former Multimedia Journalist for various news outlets across the country.\nconductor\nconductor info\nDavid J\nManager Trainee\nDavid moved to Massachusetts back in 2022 so he could spend more time with his family and friends. This led him to finding the perfect fit with Old Town Trolley Tours in January of 2024. Although David is not a Boston native, he always enjoyed stopping here each summer on the way up to his family’s Lake House in Sebago, Maine. Every year he would learn something new about the city and believes that Boston is one of the most unique cities in America. David is proud to be part of the OTT CAST here in Boston and is excited about what the future holds here at Historic Tours of America.\nconductor\nconductor info\nDerek\nSales Representative\nAs an Old Town Trolley Sales Representative, I enjoy connecting with our valued customers on a personal level. In this way I am helping to create lasting and positive vacation memories. Boston as a city has been on my radar, so to speak, since the age of ten when I became an avid hockey, specifically Bruins, fan. I am grateful to be part of a dynamic company living in the city of my hockey dreams!\nconductor\nconductor info\nDottie\nGhosts & Gravestones Gravedigger\n“Dottie Mayhem” (1800-1826) was a cautionary tale for giving people in high offices the benefit of the doubt. She was very unlike a beach ball, in that when you push a beach ball out a window, it will just bounce, instead of die. Also, very unlike a beach ball, she returned from the grave a murderous revenant with a penchant for all things eerie, unsettling, and absurd.\nconductor\nconductor info\nEvelyn\nGhosts & Gravestones Gravedigger\nEvelyn Row is a talented stage actress and serial killer from the late 1800s, but she does not look a day over 148. She loves entertaining and horrifying audiences so much, she sold her soul to the devil so she could perform forever. Her hobbies include collecting dead body parts, dancing with skeletons, and hypnotizing people with songs.\nconductor\nconductor info\nGordon “Gordie”\nMaintenance Manager\nRaised in the Jersey fens to the strains of Tom Lehrer and Belafonte, and nurtured among the dewy, firefly-strewn suburban lawns of the American south, Gordie has been a resident of New England for nearly half his life. He lives in Allston, the “City of Kings,” with his delightful partner and pal, Colette… and Shorpy, the cat. Gordie will be forever grateful to Old Town Trolley for releasing his inner tour guide, an entity whose existence he never suspected. Like a mastodon bellowing across primeval swamps, he hopes to share his love of this corner of America with our visitors to Boston.\nconductor\nconductor info\nGreaves Hermosa\nActor\nBeing a graveyard-bound pirate wasn’t what I had in mind when I was in school for graphic design and marketing, and while working as a waitress in Hampton, NH. I love learning. I’m getting good at stuff without worldly appreciation, trying things that scare me – and learning to be a good person. From pro wrestling to piracy, I’ve always done one thing well, diving in head first and doing my best!\nconductor\nconductor info\nGrogan\nMarketing Coordinator\nGrogan has worked for Old Town Trolley since 2021, beginning their career humbly as the undead pirate captain “Greaves Hermosa” with Ghosts & Gravestones. After setting sail back to the land of the living, Grogan moved into the role of Marketing Coordinator in 2023, creating graphics and handling media.\nconductor\nconductor info\nHarlan\nGhosts & Gravestones Gravedigger\n“Harlan Hayvrast” was condemned to a life of tourism in 1797. His actor, Derek, has fulfilled the role for OTT since 2019. Always on the stage to elevate the guest’s experience. Stay vertical.\nconductor\nconductor info\nJeff\nI have lived in Hyde Park, MA since 1995. I’m a huge Boston sports fan. In fact, I have a Red Sox tattoo on my right arm.

When not working, Jewels enjoys sailing, kayaking, hiking, traveling, and trying all sorts of new experiences and adventures with family and friends.\nconductor\nconductor info\nJim\nFleet Mechanic\nBorn during the Brinks robbery, married 51 years, and have 3 children (unfortunately no grandchildren yet).

While he specializes in the haunting industry, his range into more mainstream comedy and dramatic roles is equally impressive.

Ruben is known for trying new things and playing chess.\nconductor\nconductor info\nStephen\nConcierge\nStephen grew up in Boston, just beyond the North End. When he was a kid, one of his favorites, almost daily excursions, was to hop on the “T” after school and go on explorations all over the city with his friends. With a life-long knowledge of the city and its history, when the Concierge position opened-up at Old Town Trolley to serve at the Marriott Long Wharf Hotel, he was eager to sign on. Sharing knowledge of the city, informing guests of tours and cultural attractions, while guiding them to some of Boston’s finest restaurants, is enjoyable and fun. Stephen most likes the diversity of guests who visit the city from across the country and from every nation around the world. When people ask him what he does for a living, he jokingly replies, “I get to tell people where to go and what to do, which pretty much sums up this role, which I enjoy very much.”\nconductor\nconductor info\nSteven\nTour Entertainment Manager\nSteven currently oversees The Sons and Daughters of Liberty Educational Tour and his one-true-love – Ghosts & Gravestones of Boston.

Come and let her show you around Boston.\nconductor\nconductor info\nTracey\nHR Manager\nI was born and brought-up in Boston. Some of my best childhood memories were in the North End, visiting family, enjoying gravy on our macaroni on Sundays, getting a single purple balloon at the weekly Summer Feasts, and eating entirely too much of the original East Coast favorite, Ritchie’s Slush.\nI have worked in several industries over my 30 or so years of experience. Corporate America was no longer challenging (or fun) for me. In researching other job opportunities, I came across the HR Manager position ad for Old Town Trolley Tours of Boston. After reading all the wonderful write-ups and bios, I knew it would be a positive change if I was able to work here. I applied for the position, and the rest is history!\nAbout Us\nMeet Our Cast\nScroll\nOur Cast\nconductor\nTim\nconductor\nAgnes\nconductor\nAlanna\nconductor\nAldwin\nconductor\nAllison\nconductor\nAmy “Mary”\nconductor\nAndrew\nconductor\nAnesti\nconductor\nAriel\nconductor\nArthur\nconductor\nAspen\nconductor\nAtticus\nconductor\nAttucks\nconductor\nBalthazar\nconductor\nBeth\nconductor\nBob\nconductor\nCharlize\nconductor\nChris\nconductor\nChris C\nconductor\nDarren\nconductor\nDavid J\nconductor\nDerek\nconductor\nDottie\nconductor\nEvelyn\nconductor\nGordon “Gordie”\nconductor\nGreaves Hermosa\nconductor\nGrogan\nconductor\nHarlan\nconductor\nJeff\nconductor\nJennifer\nconductor\nJewels\nconductor\nJim\nconductor\nJohn\nconductor\nJonathan\nconductor\nKarolyn\nconductor\nKayla\nconductor\nKimberly\nconductor\nKristen\nconductor\nLauren\nconductor\nLeo “Bernard Kingsly”\nconductor\nLisa M.\nconductor\nLisa Y.\nconductor\nLiz\nconductor\nLyle\nconductor\nMalachi\nconductor\nMercy\nconductor\nMerry\nconductor\nMichele\nconductor\nMike “Foxtrot”\nconductor\nMoriah\nconductor\nNamik\nconductor\nNicholas\nconductor\nPetunia\nconductor\nRuben\nconductor\nStephen\nconductor\nSteven\nconductor\nSue\nconductor\nTracey\nScroll Down\nconductors text\nBack to Top",

For sure we will do this again.”\npost options\npost content\nH.G.\n“I went on my first trolley tour with my husband, 3 kids and parents who have grown up in the Boston area as well as my sister, her husband and her two kids from Scotland. The first tour guide we had, Quack, was AMAZING!!! He kicked our day off with great enthusiasm, excitement and energy packed with information I never knew. Before we left the starting point he offered to take group pictures of us and other guests and really made it feel family focused and fun. The rest of the day we tried finding him again just because he had all of the kids’ attention and made the experience way better!! Please thank him for us!”\nC.K., Arlington Heights, IL\n“We just returned from a visit to Boston where we took a wonderful ride on the Old Town Trolley. We need to let you know about the remarkable and entertaining guide we had – KING KNIGHT. First and most important, he was a safe driver and very knowledgeable about the history of Boston. But what made him special was his sense of humor. We all laughed throughout the trip… No one wanted to “hop off”… BEST EXCURSION of our eleven-day cruise and we owe it all to KING KNIGHT!”\nG.A.\n“Our guide, Maureen, was really brilliant. She combined extensive knowledge with humor and had unbelievable get up and go. Nothing was too much trouble. You have a unique advantage over the competition.”\nM.L., Madison, NC\n“I have been on many other sightseeing tours but none compare to Old Town Trolley Tours in Boston! The guides were so informative and entertaining, plus we saw so much of the city and that really helped us get oriented on our first day. The guides’ recommendations were spot-on and they had answers to every question thrown at them! After spending all day sightseeing on the trolley, we ended up on Crafty’s last tour of the day, and instead of rushing through the highlights so he could get home, he took the time to add anecdotes and initiate discussions with us. I will definitely look for Old Town Trolley Tours when I visit their other cities!”\nR.R.\n“The tour guide King Knight in Boston was fantastic! He provided a fascinating and funny tour and went the extra mile to make sure everyone got to where they needed to be in the end. He said he had only been on the job for 48 days, but he seemed like a seasoned vet! We truly appreciated him!”\nD.B., London, England\n“We are two French tourists and got to do your trolley in Boston with La La. She was exceptional and made this tour so lively and interesting and fun. Such a great storyteller! Thank you.”\nY.R.\n“We started out our trolley tour with Devilin with whom we went around the whole route, and then had the pleasure of riding with FoxTrot and Papa Jim when we re-boarded after more closely visiting some of Boston’s most iconic sites.\nWe were 6 and all of our group really loved the narrated historic tour of Boston; the humor and knowledge of your driver guides was much appreciated. Also, their responsible driving in Boston’s not always wide streets was paramount in our feeling safe during the tour. Hats off to FoxTrot who firmly but gently made sure a noisy lot out back refrained from loud conversations preventing us from hearing clearly his commentaries. As all of our group’s mother tongue is French, we needed all our attention to be focused on the narrator…\nHoping to ride with you guys in one of your other locations; we wish your whole team all the best.”\nK.L., Lynn, MA\n“I just wanted to let you know that, while we enjoyed our tour yesterday, we were especially impressed with two of your guides: Marilyn on the shuttle loop, and Regan. Both were pleasant, personable and went above and beyond.”\nP.K.\n“My wife and I are in Boston and had North as our Tour Guide. We stayed on the bus from Stop 1 through to the end, arriving back at Stop 1. He was fantastic – we think driving a large, wide bus on Boston’s narrow, congested streets would be an incredible skill alone, but to also have the ability to continuously provide relevant and interesting historic information while driving is another major skill unto itself. North also did this while speaking loudly, clearly, and by keeping the passengers engaged – it was obvious he was also a lover of history and shared the information with excited passion. His personality and demeanor truly made the tour memorable.”\nD.R., Elmwood Park, NJ\n“As always, we had a great time doing your tour! I would like to point out something about our first guide… We had Miss Jackson! She was fantastic – that doesn’t even give her justice. She gave a great history of the city and sites, made some jokes and made the time we were on her trolley so enjoyable! She had a great personality and was just a bright star on our trip! Thank you for the opportunity to get to meet her and to take the tour!”\nK.Z., Heath, OH\n“My family and I visited Boston this past week and scheduled a tour to see the city. While all of your drivers were knowledgeable and polite there was one that truly made the experience. Ms. Beantown was not only super entertaining, she went out of her way to help my family with wheelchair assistance with her trolley AND onto another Old Town Trolley at a different stop later in the day. Her kindness was one of the best parts of our trip.”\nC.G., Blackfalds, AB\n“I wanted to reach out about the absolutely fantastic tour we had of Boston. We were picked up from the Cheers stop by your driver, Twin, who got us through downtown rush hour safely and with the most humorous commentary that was one of the highlights of the trip. Not only did he keep up on discussing the points of interest, but also gave us good information on what not to miss when we got out on foot. Thanks for having such a great Boston team.”\nS.V., Coon Rapids, MN\n“We rode with two drivers today, Miss Jackson and Crafty. They are both PHENOMENAL. They made our trips around town outstanding and informative. Thank you so much for hiring the best! Make sure to compensate them above and beyond so that they continue to rep your company and the city of Boston so spectacularly!”\nR.A., Toronto, Ontario\nLast week I was in Boston with my family visiting the city for a number of events. While there, we took your tour and had a fabulous time learning more about the great historical spots. What made the tour memorable was our conductor, ‘Townie’. Townie made the tour one of the highlights of our trip, and having been on many other operators in various cities, I must applaud him, as they’re the exact type of tour conductor you want on an introduction to the city. I was on with my wife and 2 kids (aged 8 and 12), and Townie not only managed to enlighten with facts about the city, but his sense of humor was on point and fitting for those of all ages. A week later, our family is still citing lines from Townie on our trip. He is a true gem for you to have in your fleet… He may be the reason we again return to Boston!\nD.D., Mansfield, MA\n“We were fortunate enough to get Miss Jackson as our Tour guide on a departure from “Stop 1″ at noon on Saturday. Miss Jackson is terrific. She is entertaining, knowledgeable about Boston, friendly, well spoken and a great driver. Miss Jackson had us laughing and singing and I can’t imagine a more entertaining and informative Tour Guide. We’ve taken many tours over the years and Miss Jackson is at the top of the list. Thank you Miss Jackson, Drew & Elizabeth.”\nF.C.\n“My friend & I traveled on one of your tours in Boston on 12 June and found it informative & a very pleasing experience. We particularly would like to commend our guide, North, for his professionalism, his knowledge of the area, both in regards to its history and culture. He was easy to understand and was extremely warm & polite. We stayed on the bus for the entire trip because we felt we may risk not getting as good a guide on other buses. We subsequently visited the points of interest that appealed to us the most, following The freedom Trail a lot of the way. A fabulous day in Boston, initiated particularly from our wonderful experience on your bus tour & our Guide, North.”\nV.R.\n“My very first visit to The Cradle of Liberty was greatly enhanced by our fun and informative Old Town Trolley guide. From the moment we arrived at the first stop we were personally greeted by our driver and guide making us feel welcome and personally cared about. Our driver, Papa Jim, was courteous, professional, and great fun! When I noticed his name tag it made me feel right at home because that is what we call my husband! I told him that and he told me the fun story of how his grandsons helped him come up with the name. After everyone was seated he came to my seat, carrying his Papa Jim sign and asked if I wanted a picture of it to share with my husband. I was so happy because I knew my husband would really love this and as I had been gone for a week, he was really missing me. But we did even better than that, we took a picture together! Such a nice man to go above and beyond in customer service! Papa Jim was full of historical facts and little known whimsical tidbits that kept us all throughly entertained throughout the whole trip! Thank you, Old Town Trolley and Papa Jim for a memorable experience learning about Boston and The Freedom Trail.”\nM.F.M.\n“I REALLY hope this review makes it back to our tour guide, Magoo. We stepped on his trolley after visiting the USS Constitution, and I couldn’t even get off at any other stops because of his enthusiasm and knowledge of the city. There is no better way to learn about such a historic city than from a local. I have never been a history buff, but he kept my attention span!! This man loves his job and his city and is truly passionate about teaching it to others. I’m honored to have had him as my Boston tour guide. Mr. Magoo, again, I hope this review makes it back to you. Thank you and keep smiling.”\nM.V., Erie, PA:\n“Reagan, our guide in Boston was amazing. He was definitely from the area and was so knowledgeable. We had a wonderful time on his trolley. We actually were going to get off but decided to ride the whole trip around with him because he knew so much. A couple times we got stuck in some traffic so he took shortcuts to get us around and we got to see some extra things. It was a great experience on our first trip to Boston.”\nL.H.\n“We spent the past two days on the Boston Trolley tour and of the several tour guides we encountered, Gonzo was the best guide. We really appreciated all the enthusiastic commentary and entertaining demeanor. We rode the same path several times on our trip. Gonzo hit all the key information, but also added additional facts which kept it interesting. He was a great tour guide and we would have loved to ride the entire route with him, but kept getting on at a later stop and had to change at 1. Thanks for a great tour of Boston.”\nG.R., Paducah, KY:\n“We enjoyed greatly our tour today. Our tour guide, Phoenix, was very knowledgeable, had a good wit, and shared many, many nuggets of information that made the trip interesting and full of energy. Even when we asked about other points of interest we thought he might know about he was able provide name and an interesting nugget about it. He met children’s interests as well as adults. Will definitely tell others about your service and have them look for Phoenix. Thank you all.”\nT.O., Torrance, CA:\n“We were very happy to have two fantastic tour guides while using your service in Boston. Our first was Misklin, who was not only informative and funny but also helped us figure out our somewhat complicated return trip on a tight schedule. Also kudos to Uncle Steve, who in addition to sharing some very interesting stories about Boston history, went out of his way to help part of our party get back to their hotel after hours. These guys were great! I hope to see them again next time we are in Boston. You should hire more like them!”\nS.G., Erie, PA:\n“Yesterday was my\nfirst time in Boston\n, and first time using any Hop On Hop Off service. Your driver, Maureen, was by far the most memorable part of our trip. Her enthusiasm and energy lit up the entire trolley. She’s is passionate about her home town, packed full of tons and tons of information, and lovely to make the entire experience a GREAT one. My friends and I cannot wait to visit Boston again soon, and are hoping to have Maureen as our trolley driver. Thank you for a great traveling experience; tell Maureen thank you for us! She is a PERFECT representative for your company. Yay Maureen!!!”\nR.H., Dalton, OH:\n“I was in Boston 6/21-22 to see U2. I hurt my knee before going & figured it would be easier riding the trolley to see Boston than hobbling. I had a BLAST riding with the trolley! I used a 2-day pass and it also helped me get to the\nTD Garden\n, avoiding traffic and high taxi fares, just hopping off on that trolley stop, last of the day. In all, I had 4 trolley drivers/guides. Each was funny, gave interesting and different presentations and WORTH every penny of my ticket and every tip. Gonzo, Captain Matty, Bunker & I think, Mike were excellent. You couldn’t pay me enough to drive in that crazy traffic. I’m a fan & will look forward to doing that again. I hope you can share my comments with them. Thanks.”\nS.E., Crete, IL:\n“I wish to commend John W. Very long last name. What an amazing asset you have there. A man that never stopped talking the entire trip. Such a wealth of information. You can tell that he has been in Boston all of his life and loves it. Truly made the trip worth while.”\nA.H., Oregon, WI:\n“My 82-year-old mother, with a walker, and I, used your trolley service the last 2 days to enable us to enjoy Boston. Yesterday we had New York three different times, he was always so careful to hop out with a foot stool and assist my mom up the steps and stow the walker underneath. He was respectful, kind and patient. Today we had Bret for our longest ride. He too was patient, helpful and kind. Additionally, his humor and expert professional presentation was noteworthy. My husband and I used your trolley on our first trip to Boston and were very impressed with the guides. Your service helped us at that point as he had recently broken his ankle. I would recommend your trolley to anyone coming to Boston for the first time, or trying to visit with a mobility limitation. I wanted to recognize Bret as a stand out guide, as his presentation is exceptional. Thank you for a fantastic service.”\nJ.S., Glen Burnie, MD:\n“Today, we did the last tour of the day with Scribe as our tour guide and he was phenomenal! He was knowledgeable, extremely affable and made us feel like family. My husband said it was money well spent and made our trip! Such an asset to your company! Thanks for your service today, Scribe.”\nE.L., Glendale, AZ:\n“Micheal Angelo was fantastic. He’s very entertaining and knowledgeable. Micheal told us history about Boston we would have never known reading a book. I’d love to take your tour again as long as Micheal Angelo is giving it. Very good.”\nM.F., Gilberts, IL:\n“Just did a Tour with JD last weekend. He was awesome…… the tour was the best part of our trip to Boston. Not sure if you have a survey….. just wanted you to know he got an A+++ Thank you!!!!”\nV.W.,\nGloucester, MA:\n“\nHi. My friends and I used your services, Friday, June 23. We had the overwhelming pleasure of having Capt. Matty as one of our guides. He was singlehandedly, the most entertaining and interactive guide we had for the day. He truly made our trip into Boston quite a memorable one! I look forward to looking out for him next time in town.”\nF.G.,\nThe Woodlands, TX:\n“\nMy husband and I were in Boston after 25 years. We decided last minute to take one of your trolley tours. We had such a wonderful time! I learned more about Boston on that tour than in the seven years I lived there. Our guide Hugo was the BEST! He kept us laughing the whole time. Thank you for making our last day in Boston a happy and memorable one!”\nC.W., Dallas, TX:\n“Good morning! I wanted to write to say how much we enjoyed our 2 days on the Trolley in Boston last week. You took us everywhere we needed to go to get a full Boston experience. All the drivers were great but our favorite driver by far was Sonny! We laughed so much with him. We loved being able to have a mobile ticket and not fumbling for paper ones all day. Your MIT stop was right by our hotel. Your service was a highlight of our trip. If our travels ever take us from Dallas to Boston again, we will be joining a Trolley Tour. Thank you!”\nJ.L.,\nNorfolk, VA\n“Recently my wife and I enjoyed a two-day tour of Boston on the Hop On and Off Trolley Tours. Our tour guide Greg was absolutely fantastic. His acting background provided for a very enjoyable and whimsical performance that was magnificent. The tour experience was filled with tidbits of information, unusually anecdotes woven with personal experiences from past tour participants and local’s stories relating to the\nhistoric sites\naround town, the people associated with the sites and the town itself.\nGreg’s pride in his profession and ability to relate to the tour group are rare commodities that should be rewarded.”\nL.H., Burlington, ON:\n“We were in Boston and booked a tour with your company on\nOctober\n11. Your tour driver, Hambone, was truly amazing. He provided excellent service and volumes of historical information. We were very impressed and enjoyed the experience and visiting your beautiful city.”\nJ. W.\n“I just wanted to let you know that we enjoyed Hugo immensely! He was hilarious, and he conveyed a great deal of warmth as though your best friend was driving you around the city. I especially loved when he said his grandmother said that something was “Gah-geous! I want to let you know that your “1.5 story trolleys” are wonderful. They are very roomy, and you can see a lot more of the sights as the tour guides point them out to you… Thank you for a wonderful experience!”\nK.F., Miami, FL:\n“I just wanted to say thank you to all the guides we had during our trip the last couple of days. We had the pleasure of touring with Scribe, Captain Matty (twice), Boston Bob, Ron, Papa, Sonny, Michelangelo and Little Dave. Each one did an amazing job of representing Boston and were very knowledgeable, as well as, helpful with getting around the city at each stop. Our two favorites were Michelangelo & Captain Matty, but we truly enjoyed our time with each person! Thank you for making our first Boston trip so special and entertaining! We can’t wait to come back for another visit and tour!”\nK.T., NYC:\n“I’m grateful for the hop on/off tours; without them my aging parents would have struggled to see Boston; and they loved hearing the history. Perfect segue: We had several different guides… Book was far/away our favorite. Good storyteller, quick wit, quite helpful. Interesting guy… But seriously, really enjoyed his tour. Cheers.”\nA.J., Katy, Texas:\n“Giovanni was fantastic! We came to Boston on an impromptu trip! He definitely made it special! He had a great personality and high energy! We tried to get him as many times as possible! Giovanni really knew his stuff!”\nD.O.:\n“I would like to thank everyone at Old Town Trolley for providing such a wonderful trip to Boston for myself and my family. I cannot thank you enough for giving us such wonderful family memories. I would especially like to thank the greatest tour guides we had: Gianni and Miles. Their friendly disposition, and knowledgeable commentary helped make Boston feel like home… They were both very informative and personable. We hope to have them again as tour guides in the future.”\nC.P.:\n“My wife, son & I took advantage of the Old Town Trolley tour of Boston. Our second tour guide, Animal, made the tour. His vast knowledge of the city, coupled with his down-to-earth approach of relating the city’s history, made the entire experience phenomenal. As a former teacher, I applaud Animal for his unique ability to engage my eleven-year-old who couldn’t stop talking about how much he learned and how much he loved the tour. Animal is an asset to your organization and you should strive for more employees like him.”\nJ.B., Newburgh, IN:\n“I just wanted to tell you how much I thoroughly enjoyed my tour over the past several days. I bought my first ticket for Mon-Tues, and I purchased another ticket for Th-Friday. I had the pleasure of listening to several of drivers/guides. They were all good. However, I must tell you that both Clark Kent and J were just fantastic! Clark Kent was courteous, entertaining (loved his impersonations), and had loads of information… He made everyone feel welcome, asking where we were from… J was sooo funny. I actually sat through almost all the stops because I wanted to hear everything she had to say. She delivered a lot of information & made us laugh throughout the tour. Your tour (along with J and Clark Kent) really made my visit to Boston thoroughly enjoyable. Thank you!”\nL.Y., Naples, FL:\n“Had the pleasure of taking a tour in\nBoston this July 4th\nweekend. My tour was exceptional with the narration of your professional Bostonian Giovanni. I boarded the tour with the intention of exiting the next stop. He was so captivating we stayed riding around the city and departed once his tour was complete. I’m retired Navy and have been in the customer service side of the Navy. Giovanni is OUTSTANDING; thank you very much for hiring such a great tour guide and making my Boston experience one I will never forget.”\nJ.R.:\n“My family recently visited Boston on vacation. It was our first time traveling to Boston. We bought tickets for Trolley Tours and a Ghost Tour. The Ghost Tour was lots of fun, even our children thought so. We rode the trolley through town the next 2 days and our drivers Papa and Gonzo were wonderful! They are both funny and very knowledgeable about Boston. Thank you so much! We highly recommend your company for travelers especially families.”\nA.B.:\n“I just returned from a trip to Boston with my family. Marcie at OTT in Savannah had told me about the tour in Boston (I take student groups to Savannah and use OTT). I just wanted to let you know that Patti at the OTT location at the Marriott\nCopley Square\nwas wonderful! She was so helpful – she gave us trolley advice and advice on navigating a city that we were not familiar with. Then we got on our first trolley to begin our tour – Warden from South Carolina was our driver. He was fabulous!! Knowledgeable with a personality. Two traits that are a must in the tourism business. I just wanted to say thanks to all that helped make our trip to Boston enjoyable!”\nT.D., MO:\n“I wanted to compliment two tour guides in Boston. Bubba and Mr. Christmas were absolutely wonderful! Their personalities were bigger than life and the information they shared along the route was outstanding. As a first time visitor to Boston, the trolley tour and these two guys made my experience memorable. Thanks!”\nK.N., Scarborough:\n“Not knowing what to do in Boston other than taking a tour of\nFenway Park\n, I searched the web and found Old Town Trolley of Boston. Again, not knowing what I was getting myself into, I ordered tickets from their website before going on our trip hoping for the best. To say the very least, my husband and I were very impressed on how everyone connected with Old Town Trolley were professional, accommodating, friendly and well informed of their tours. We would like to pat Kyle on the back for being on his first tour and presenting as being a veteran conductor and special thanks to Bubba for taking us back to our hotel, out of his way. Great Job, the Fenway Couple from Toronto.”\nB.F., Los Angeles, CA:\n“Hi there, I just wanted to say that I had such a wonderful time during my Old Town Trolley Tour of Boston today. “The Duke” was absolutely delightful as my tour conductor for stops 1-9, which set a very positive tone for the rest of the tour. “Bubba” did a good job from stops 9-13 as well, and so did Mr. ? (I don’t remember his last name, but his first might be John) from stops 13-16. Anyway, thanks for the great tour. I am so glad I took the tour and had “The Duke” for the majority of it. 🙂 Best regards”\nM. & L. S., Kingston, ON:\n“My wife and I were trying to find some of the best ways to experience the culture and history of the city and we came across your tours. It gave us a perfect blend of experiencing the city and offering transportation as we didn’t want to drive in a city we are unfamiliar with. Your tour operators were fantastic and we found that everyone of them had their own unique personality and delivery. We used the service very often in our time there and found each operator had something new to tell us and put their own spin on the facts. Our drivers over the weekend were: Animal, Cannon, J, Giovanni, Boston Bob, The Duke and Peppermint Patty… We plan to recommend your service to anyone heading to Boston or the other cities you have these tours at. You should be very proud of the people you have at your company! A couple of very grateful Canadians.”\nJ.C.:\n“Recently rode the trolley in Boston and had a fantastic tour guide, Dick. He was incredibly polite, knowledgeable, funny, and just all-around great. He even took extra time to help us return to our hotel in the seaport district at the end of his run. We truly enjoyed being on his tour!”\nS.A., New Jersey:\n“My girlfriend and I wanted to say how great Billy Ketch was. Not only was he extremely knowledgeable about your great city, his sense of humor and personality made this an unforgettable experience.”\nN.R.:\n“I wanted to say thank you – particularly to The Duke who looked after me at both ends of my journey and made sure I got the best experience possible in the only 5 hours of daylight I had spare in Boston. He fully advised me what to do and where to go and I really feel I got to see Boston, learned about the history and enjoyed myself. Thanks also to Irish and Miles for being great – but my prince was The Duke for his suggestions, helpfulness and all-round enthusiasm.”\nW.B., Moncton New-Brunswick:\n“We are tourists from Canada and arrived in Boston on December 27… Our first conductor was Mission Hill Mitch; we were very impressed with his professional but yet pleasant personality; we had him for most of the stops rite to\nQuincy Market; a very big thanks to him; then we had Bubba; he was also very good; thank you Bubba; the third fella we only had for one stop and did not get his name, but also friendly\n. The reason for being in Boston mainly was for the Boston Bruins Game that night; but we purchased our Trolley tour tickets online, and I had never been on a trolley tour ever; and this ended up being the highlight of our stay in Boston… a very big THANKS!!!! and will be recommending your tour to anyone I hear that is going to Boston.”\nJ.S., Napa, CA:\n“At first, I was skeptical when my wife bought\ntickets to the Boston Trolley tour\n. It was the most fun we had in Boston. The versatility of getting on and off the trolley made our day. We enjoyed walking through the parks and seeing things we would have normally missed. All of the drivers provided an abundance of Boston history and interesting facts. We visited the Boston Tea Party Museum as part of our tour; it was put together very well! If you are considering this tour, start early. There is a lot to see in Boston. Take advantage of getting on and off at different stops and explore! If we return to Boston or other cities where Historic Tours of America operates, we will definitely book with you. Thanks for the great time!”\nB.S., Litchfield, NH:\n“VINNIE WAS THE BEST!!! Thank you for having him on the staff. My three girls talked about him the whole ride home and then tried to tell some of the jokes he told the next morning! He made a sightseeing tour the best time for all of us. GIVE THAT MAN A RAISE! Thank you Vinnie!”\nR.P.:\n“Four of us toured Boston using your company today. We were extremely pleased with everything. The guides are knowledgeable, entertaining and the trolleys arrived at the meeting places in a timely routine. We were especially impressed with our guide Giovanni. He was so funny and kept us very interested with some great stories while relating history. He helped make the whole experience more enjoyable & ended our tour on a great note!”\nR.C., New Hartford, NY:\n“Mata Jones was AMAZING!! We bring our 5th grade class from Marcy NY to Boston each year. We were there last Friday. I was fortunate that my class was escorted by Mata Jones. She made the trolley portion of our very rainy tour of Boston incredibly enjoyable!! I’ve been doing this trip for 17 years and she is, by far, the best Old Town Trolley Guide I’ve ever had!! The parents, students, and I had a ball! Thank you Mata!!!! She was engaging and energetic. We had a great time singing along with her. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I hope I get her again next year.”\nL.R., Surrey, BC, CAN:\n“This was our first visit to Boston from Canada and The Old Town Trolley was an excellent way to see the city and learn more about its history. I especially liked the fact that we could hop on and off as we wanted. I’ve done this kind of tour in the UK and I highly recommend it as an outstanding way to see any city! On our third bus, Cole was our conductor and he was fabulous! Informative, funny and helpful. By the time our tour was finished it was the end of the line time-wise and our connecting trolley bus was done for the day. Cole took us very close to our hotel so that we didn’t have to try and find our way back. Would certainly try the trolley ride again when I visit another US city!”\nS.G., Round Rock, TX:\n“Just wanted to drop you guys a quick note of “THANKS !!”. My husband and I spent last week in Boston, MA and purchased a 2-day trolley tour online. WOW !! Best money I have ever spent on any guided tour anywhere EVER ! Your conductors are not only impressive in their knowledge of the various sites along the route but also are extremely well versed on other interesting information all along the route and, most importantly, incredibly patient in their maneuvering through traffic throughout the city. They are also incredibly funny ! Riding on one of these trolleys is like riding a rolling infotainment mobile. It’s awesome !! Over the\n2 days in Boston\nwe rode the trolley we had the pleasure of being hauled around town and entertained by 3 conductors – – Wicker, Lil Bean and another gentleman who’s name I can’t remember but he was a broad built man who liked to wear his ball cap backwards… Again, thanks so much for educating and entertaining us. We could not have asked for a better experience!”\nA.S, Tremonton, UT:\n“I just wanted to say that our tour guide “J” was great! We were not the only ones that enjoyed her. There was another family that didn’t want to get off when we got back to stop one. We were all going to wait for J until we found out it was her break. I enjoyed the tour overall. It was nice to get on and off when we wanted. Over 2 days we rode a few sections more than once. We heard something new each time. Each conductOr gave it their own twist which was nice. Thanks for a great time!”\nB.G.:\n“I am a International Tour Director from Britain. I have just gotten my schedule and will be giving the heads up for the Old Town Trolley Tours which I hope all my pax will be taking while on their stay in Boston. I was given passes to go onto the other trolleys and NO COMPARISON to yours. Everyone is great and I have gotten to know most of the drivers from years past. They are the best and have the best tour. Looking forward in seeing everyone again this year. Cheers.”\nM.N., Chicago, IL:\n“I was in Boston last weekend with my husband for our first trip without kids in 10 years. Our hotel recommended the Old Town Trolley & purchased tickets for us. The trolley operator Mr. Kelley was fantastic. He had us laughing, singing, and had bits of info that really made the tour special. The ability to get on & off the trolley was great. We got off & had lunch and were able to meet trolley operator “the viking” and “sugar” who were both equally entertaining. Boston is so full of great stuff to do and I will recommend the trolley to anyone who goes to Boston!! Thanks for a great weekend!”\nB., Sparta, NJ:\n“I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you how much my wife and I enjoyed our trip to boston and our ride with you. It was very informative and because of how nice and good the service and drivers where in Boston, I will be looking for your service in all other cities I go to. Two of the drivers I really liked was Buck and Friday. Thank you again for a very nice service.”\nH.M.:\n“I was in the Boston area. I researched the different trolley tours before I arrived and I had absolutely no hesitation with choosing Old Town Trolley. While there, I had the pleasure of riding the trolley Saturday and Sunday. Saturday – Nick was our tour guide, and he was excellent!… Nick made the ride VERY worth while. I completely enjoyed it! On Sunday – we started out with Peppermint Patty and she was just as great. She is very knowledgeable of the history of Boston. We ended our ride with her at the\nBoston Public Garden\nand later got back on at the original Cheers with Sean. Sean, too, was great! We rode with him back to stop one. I love the fact that all the tour guides have different facts they share with us that we maybe didn’t hear the first time around. I learned so much about the historic and present things going on in the city. There was not enough time to stop and see everything – which means there will have to be a next time! No doubt in my mind I would choose Old Town Trolley again! I will definitely recommend everyone visiting the area to do this tour! Thank you for an excellent time!!”\nK.L, Chicago, IL:\n“I was skeptical and have never done the hop on and off trolley stuff when I visit various cities but I am a convert. It was the best value in Boston and my mother and I loved our guides (Brownie, who took us from our hotel to the wharf, Scout and her wooden nickels she kept passing out as prizes, and Whit who was new but had his shtick down well). I went to yelp and gave you 5 stars and will recommend to anyone I know going to Boston. I tipped these drivers well and I don’t know if they get bonuses for doing a great job, but they should. They were a real highlight for my mom and since she loved the trip so much, that made it all the more special for me… never had to wait more than a few minutes for a trolley… whew!”\nA.B.:\n“I have used your services before, and have always been pleased. But this time I have been “awed”… My conductor was “J”, she is funny, energetic, and very informative. I liked it so much, I am buying tickets again tomorrow. Thank you for a great experience!”\nR.V., South Amboy, NJ:\n“…my girlfriend and I spent the day last week on the trolley. We were very happy with the service. Especially Dick. His guidance through the city and his knowledge, personality and his overall performance as a tour guide made the day extra special. We even stuck around with him to get the whole tour again from Dick. Please extend a huge thank you for us.”\nC.L., Waxahachie, TX:\n“My friends, husband and I were on the Trolley with Billy last week and had the BEST tour! Having been an American History teacher for 30 years, I was truly fascinated with Billy’s knowledge and experience with the tour! Even my friends who are not especially interested in History, thought that Billy was the greatest tour guide they had ever had.”\nJ.J., Tampa, FL:\n“We have just taken a trolley\ntour of Boston with a group\nof 7 people. I just wanted to let you know that your service is excellent and very professional as well as informative and fun. I am very impressed with your company and want to compliment you for this service. Our favorite conductor was Marc; although we only were fortunate to have him for a short ride before changing trolleys. He was just great! Go Marc! Also, I would like to thank Jean for her communication with me as I planned this trip. Jean, you were very helpful. I am a graduate of Boston University, so one would think I know the city! Well… I saw many sites that I had not ventured into when I was a student. It was nostalgic and a lot of fun!”\nD.E.:\n“I have just arrived back in England after spending a wonderful week in Boston. One of the many highlights was the trolley tour we took on the first day. The sights were made even more special by the entertaining, informative and humorous commentary from our guide,’Paffy’. Please thank him, and I will look forward to visiting Boston again and taking a trolley tour.”\nR.T., Mason, OH:\n“Having had a very good time on your tour in Boston 3 weeks ago, we decided to try out one of your Savannah GA Tours. Once, again, a good time was had by our family. Drivers all were fun in some way. Singing a rousing rendition of the “Bohemian Rhapsody” in Boston was a LOT of fun!”\nD.M., Michigan:\n“My husband and I spent a day on the Boston trolley. All of the conductors were knowledgeable but Peppermint Patty really did a wonderful job. In fact, we had such a great time listening to her that we didn’t get off at the stops we had planned on. Just wanted to let you know that you made our Boston trip more enjoyable. Thank you. This was the second time we took an Old Town Trolley and if there is one in the next city we vacation, we will be on it!”\nS.R., Goleta, CA:\n“We took the Old Town Trolley Tour with Paul from Pennsylvania. It was one of the best tours I have ever taken. Paul was hilarious, entertaining, informative, and very welcoming to everyone aboard. He had us all laughing. I work for the Visitor Center in Santa Barbara, CA, so I have high expectations of tours. Your tour and tour guide greatly exceeded them! Thanks for a wonderful memory of Boston!”\nT.Z., Mission Viejo, CA:\n“Your tour of the city is everything you promise. All your drivers and staff are very well trained and versed in the system. They are very helpful which makes it easy for us out of towners. The tour was extremely well done. It allowed us to take the Harbor Cruise and walk a considerable amount of the Freedom Trail in the limited day we had in Boston. We will recommend you to anyone who we know that is heading your way. Thanks again.”\nJ.M., Peabody, MA:\n“My mother, grandfather, and I went on one of your Boston tours … I thought I would take a minute to comment here. We had an absolutely wonderful tour. Even though we live in Massachusetts, we learned so much about the history of Boston, thanks to our guide. His extensive knowledge of local history, as well as his enthusiasm for it, made the tour both exciting and interesting. Thanks for an amazing experience!”\nS.S., Bordentown, NJ:\n“My mom and I enjoyed our trolley experience tremendously! It went off without a hitch! The guides were all very informative and really added to the sightseeing experience. We were able to see and do so much more because of the trolley. We were also pleased to see that you have wheelchair accessible options, as next time we will be traveling with a wheelchair user. We have already recommended you to several people. Old Town Trolley Tours really made our whole trip!”\nL.D. Cedar Hill, TX:\n“What a great and memorable method of seeing the entire city when you only have a day to devote to it! A true capsulated version of everything Boston has to offer wrapped up in a rollicking trolley ride narrated by a funny, entertaining tour guide! You literally feel as though you’ve stepped inside a giant history book and re-lived it, sound effects and all!!! One excellent advantage is the ability to hop on-hop off throughout the day!!!”\nJ.V. Fredericksburg, VA:\n“Our driver was extremely knowledgeable on the sites and history of the city and pointed out interests that I, personally, didn’t see in the other brochures. The information he passed on during our ride has sparked a real interest in returning to your beautiful city to take in the sights. I will definitely repeat the trolley tour!!”\nG.P. Downers Grove, IL:\n“Finally had the opportunity to experience your product!! I was extremely impressed with the ease of ticket purchase on the web. We took the train into Boston and upon arrival – there you were!! Excellent way to tour Boston for the first time visitor!! Both drivers were very well versed and had tons of information about the best\nBoston attractions\n. Both had an excellent sense of humor and combined with their historic knowledge – it was the icing on the cake! Old Town Trolley is the only way to experience the city when time is short and destination knowledge is nil!!!”\nS.B. Jamaica Plain, MA:\n“I recently moved to Boston and had the family visiting from out of town. They ranged from 20 to 79 years old and EVERYONE enjoyed the tour. We especially liked The Professor.”\nW.K. Alton, ME:\n“The Old Town Trolley was an excellent way to see the city of Boston and learn more about its history. I especially liked the fact that we could hop on and off as we wanted. I highly recommend it as an outstanding way to see the city!”\nV.K. Houston, TX:\n“This was a great way to see the city. The two tour guides were both friendly and EXTREMELY knowledgeable. I would recommend this tour to anybody visiting Boston. I even dazzled my friends later in the week with all that I knew of the city. Thanks for an awesome visit!!!”\nL.S. Somerville, MA:\n“I was able to see a lot of places in Boston I didn’t know about and thanks for making my tour of Boston a great one! Russ was very funny and added extra spice to the tour! Ron was very knowledgeable as well and did a great job!”\nR.K. Colbert, WA:\n“This worked very well, especially for my husband who has difficulty walking at times. We were able to get a great overview and be selective about where to disembark so we could walk to points of interest.”\nD.L. Casco, ME:\n“My husband and I truly loved the Trolley…very, very interesting, very informative. All the trolley drivers were very nice, smart and once again, informative. We are so glad we had your tickets, for without them I don’t see how we could have learned so much. The ride was so convenient to our hotel and took us around the whole city. Everyplace I wanted to see was part of the tour. For sure we will do this again…Thank you so much for a great weekend getaway, and 1st anniversary for me and my husband.”\nN & R Trumm, UK:\n“We would like to thank lil bean for a wonderful tour\naround Boston\n. She made the day very enjoyable and we will not forget her smiley face and bubbly personality; trolley buses should be proud to have her working for them. thanks again!”\nJ.L., Palmdale, CA:\n“I wanted to take a moment to commend one of your trolley drivers. My wife and I have taken your San Diego tours in the past and that positive experience led us to take the Boston Trolley tour when we were in town. Though we hopped on and off the trolley many times throughout the day, the hands down highlight of the on-trolley experience was having Nate for a guide. Nate took us from the U.S.S. Constitution stop until we got off a few stops down the way. He was hysterical and informative at the same time. Every time we got back on the trolley the rest of the day we were hoping it would be him again. We would have like to take the entire loop with him first, then do our hopping thereafter. Do whatever it takes to hold on to Nate, he is an asset and serves your company well.”\nL.S., Orlando, FL:\n“I just wanted to thank you for an amazing tour! I had lived in the area for 21 years and moved to Florida 5 years ago. We just recently brought my 7 year old step-daughter for a visit and we only had one day in the city. This tour had everything on it! She learned so much stuff it was wonderful. I even learned things I had no clue about! So thank you for an amazing day that will not soon be forgotten!”\nG.C., Virginia Beach, VA:\n“My husband and I were in Boston on a Royal Caribbean Cruise and booked a trolley tour in Boston. Much to our dismay we were there on June 19th the day of the duck parade for the Celtics. I thought we wouldn’t get to see very much but thanks to our tour operator Mr. Ballgame and our shuttle trolley operator “Sue”, we got a wonderful tour and it was amazing how they maneuvered around the traffic. I’m telling every one I know what a wonderful tour this is and look forward to doing it again when we revisit Boston. The operators were amazing! Nice, knowledgeable, and full of personality. They are certainly an asset to Boston and your organization.”\nM.G., Jamison, PA:\n“You have one of the Best websites we have encountered. It is easy to navigate and is not “clogged” with non-related information.”\nL.W.:\n“I was recently in Boston and took a trolley tour; all the tour guides were awesome but I am writing to you to say that scout was the most outstanding tour guide I have ever had; she was very funny and knowledgeable… great fun. Will definitely recommend this tour to a friend.”\nM.L., Lake Oswego, OR:\n“We bought the Salem package yesterday and went to Salem. I did not get the names of the guides, but there were only 2 trolleys running and we had interaction with both. I cannot say enough about how helpful they all were. We were stuck in a storm and the ferry was not running when we wanted to come back. They called to see if it was… they took us as close to the train station as they could get us and were in general VERY helpful. Thank you so much for your crew and their willingness to help out in unusual situations. My granddaughter goes to Harvard so I will be back in your fair city from time to time and will definitely try some of your other packages. I will also recommend you to anyone I know is coming to Boston You are the best!!!! Thank you.”\nS.G.:\n“Recently visited Boston and used Old Town Trolley Tours while there. One of the most positive experiences we’ve ever had while traveling. Each tour guide was excellent, very helpful and the narration was great! Enjoyed every moment, and the cost was reasonable! Will be recommending your company to our family and friends! Thanks for making our first trip to Boston so memorable!”\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",

However, an Old Town Trolley Tour is more than just a narration, it’s an experience! You’ll hear sound effects and much more.\nCan I get on and off wherever I want?\nYes! This is one of the most unique and enjoyable aspects of an Old Town Trolley Tour. You can hop off and hop back on at any of our stops around the city, sightseeing at your own pace.\nAre food and drinks allowed while on the tour?\nFood and drinks are welcome. However alcoholic beverages are not allowed under any circumstance for the safety and comfort of all of our guests.\nCan I use my credit card to purchase a ticket?\nWe accept all major credit cards at our sales depots in Nashville. You may also buy a ticket online.

In addition, most Nashville hotels have tickets available at their concierge desk or you may\npurchase tickets online\n.\nAre baby carriages allowed on your trolleys?\nYes, children are always welcome on Old Town Trolleys. We do ask that carriages be collapsed; the tour conductor will store the collapsed carriage in a safe place on the trolley until you’re ready to step down at a departure point.\nAre dogs allowed on your trolleys?\nService animals are the only animals that are allowed on board the trolleys. A service animal means a dog, regardless of breed or type, that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Animal species other than dogs, emotional support animals, comfort animals, companionship animals, and service animals in training are not service animals.\nAre the trolleys handicap-accessible?\nA certain number of our trolleys are equipped with hydraulic wheelchair lifts. We do ask that you call ahead to arrange use of these vehicles. For more information, go to\naccessibility services\n.\nAre your trolleys enclosed?\nThe trolleys are open-air vehicles but have plastic “isinglass” windows that can roll up or roll down depending on the weather conditions\nHow much does a trolley pass cost?\nPlease go to\nRates & Reservations\n.\nDo you rent trolleys for group tours, weddings, special events, and transportation charters?\nAbsolutely! In fact, we proudly operate Nashville’s largest fleet of sightseeing vehicles, which allows us to accommodate groups both large and small. For more information or to book please call our Groups & Charters Department at (629) 208-1773, Option #4.\nDo you run tours in inclement weather?\nYes, we operate our tours rain or shine, hot or cold, year-round. However, bear in mind that some winter conditions can prohibit safe operation. Occasionally, we are forced to close operations for safety.\nAre the trolleys heated?\nYes. During the wintertime, we use heated trolleys that are glass-enclosed specifically for the colder weather.\nAre the trolleys air-conditioned?\nThe trolleys are open-air vehicles which allow for optimal sightseeing and picture-taking.\nHow many stops do you make?\nThere are 13 stops on the tour, which are conveniently located at or near all the major points of interest. Click on\nNashville Map and Stops\nto see a list of our stops and for information about the attractions and points of interest available at each stop.\nHow many times can I go through the loop?\nYou may ride the Old Town Trolley Tour around as many times as you wish. However, we recommend that you get off and on as you go and take advantage of the sights. Many of the attractions will get increasingly busy as the day wears on; so it’s often best to take advantage of the stops as you go. In addition, you will hear essentially the same information presented each time you go around on the tour, although presented by each driver with his or her own style and flair.\nHow often does the trolley pass each stop?\nOld Town Trolley Tours of Nashville operates the city’s largest fleet of sightseeing vehicles and this allows us to pick up and drop off more frequently than any other trolley company. The frequency of the trolleys depends on the time of the year, and traffic and weather conditions. In addition, the trolleys tend to run more frequently on weekends than on the weekdays.\nIf I get off and go to a museum or attraction, do you wait outside?\nThe trolleys go around the city in a continuous loop, allowing guests to hop off and hop on at the designated stops. When you hop off a trolley to see the sights at a particular stop, that trolley will continue with the tour, and another trolley will arrive shortly to make another pick up.\nWhat are your hours of operation?\nGo to\ntrolley tour schedule\n.\nWhat is a hometown pass?\nThe Hometown Pass program was designed so that residents within our nine cities, Boston, Charleston, Savannah, Key West, Washington DC, St. Augustine, Nashville, San Antonio, and San Diego, can take advantage of our tours and attractions for FREE when accompanied by an adult paid guest.* It is free to join and easy to use. For more information, please call us at 1-800-844-7601 or\nvisit us online\n. *Restrictions apply.\nCan I bring my luggage on board?\nSpace on the trolleys is limited; but in some cases it may be acceptable to bring a small suitcase on board. Bear in mind that our trolleys are designed specifically for sightseeing and therefore contain limited storage space (as compared to motor coaches.)\nCan I bring my stroller on board the trolley?\nYes, we can accommodate strollers but they must be collapsible and will be stored up front with the conductor. Strollers in the aisle ways would constitute a safety hazard.\nDo you run tours in any other cities?\nOld Town Trolley Tours operates sightseeing tours and historically themed tourist attractions in 9 different cities around the country. Go to\nSightseeing Tours\nto learn more about our other cities.\nfacts\nfacts\ntoolbar\nShare:\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\"></span>\nEmail\nPrint\n<a class=\"btn-save\" href=\"#\"> <i class=\"icon\"></i></a>\nrelated articles\nrelated articles\nUp\nUp",
