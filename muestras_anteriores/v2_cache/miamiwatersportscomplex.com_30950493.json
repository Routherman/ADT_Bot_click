Totally affordable TOO !!\nSarah Crisp\nIt’s amazing. I’ve been going for three years already and every year I go to the summer camp. The staff are very helpful with gear, learning how to ride, and tricks. I’ve improved very much since three years ago. They would give me confidence that I can do anything and I’ve gotten better year by year. It is also a fun place to go on a hot summer day and go relax and cool down in the water or the shade in the big tiki hut. When I go, my parents and I all enjoy it because I get to do something I love while they get to relax in the shade and watch me have fun time.\nMichael Rivera\nProfessionally Done. This cable-park offers the cleanest, clearest water (not a swamp), 3 distinct cable experiences, enthusiastic staff & instructors, pro shop with all the gear, food and beverages, massive outdoor covered tiki hut styled pavilion, seating, padded couches, showers, bathrooms, and everything a world-class watersports professional rider needs to train for competitions. Sporting three cables leaves the line to get sent — minimal – so you’re on the water – not waiting in lines. Say you’re just starting or wishing to cross train – the beginner cable has pros hucking air tricks – yet it’s just the right speed and set up to earn the ride time one needs to catch-on to the skills as a beginner. It just FEELS SAFE for beginners and it works! Miami Watersports Complex is a WIN every time I ride there.\nGet’cha Sum!\nJacob Bunch\nI visited MWCC in Januuary and loved it! The guys that run it are really nice, relaxed and enthusiastic about the sport; their boat is absolutely top of the line and the cable system is currently being built in Germany. I look forward to seeing that in action next time I am in Miami. If you are looking to wakeboard in Miami these are the guys to call.\nChris Nias\n305-476-9253\n401 E 65 Street\nHialeah, FL 33013\nFIRST TIME\nACTIVITIES\nCAREERS\nCOMMUNITY\nMEMBERSHIP\nGIFT CARDS\nOnline Waiver\nNotary Waiver",
