      "text": "What is Round1?\nRound1 Bowling & Arcade prides itself on offering guests ALL the fun under 1 roof. Guests can look forward to safe family fun or friendly competition with activities ranging from bowling, arcade games (Including exclusive Japan imports), 100+ crane machines, professional-grade billiards, Karaoke, and more. Additionally, Round1 also offers a variety of favorite snack foods - such as pizza, wings, ice cream - a new menu with Japanese food classics, and a bar with beer and other selections. Come on in and enjoy new ways to play and hang out. There’s enough room for everyone, so bring your friends, family, and kids.\nThe Origin of Round One Japan\nIn December of 1980, owner Masahiko Sugino established a company named Sugino Kosan and created a roller skate facility with arcade games. As popularity of the store increased, the facility expanded to include a bowling alley which made it become even more popular. Ultimately, this location became the first Round One store in 1993. Since then, the company quickly expanded all across Japan.\nRound One successfully established its national brand and currently has 100 stores as of 2021 in Japan.\nRound One always strives to be on the cutting edge of entertainment activities. As a result, Round One innovated a Sports Challenge complex called “Spo-cha” where customers can experience a variety of sports and entertainment like activities for a single fixed price for a single day. There was nothing like Spo-cha available in the market, and this kind of innovation is what truly separates Round One from its competitors.\nRound One U.S.A. Growth and Expansion\nIn 2008, Round One Entertainment Japan began looking overseas to the United States for more growth and expansion. In 2010, the company opened its first U.S. location in the Los Angeles suburb of City of Industry, California. The biggest challenge for the company at that time was that “Round One Entertainment” was an unknown entity in the U.S. But within a few years, Round One quickly opened up its second, third, and fourth locations in California and now has over 50 locations across the U.S. opened or planning to open.\nRound One USA, the U.S. branch of Round One Entertainment, has been continuing to grow rapidly nationwide since 2014. We position ourselves differently from our competitors by offering a wide variety of activities including our Kids Play Zone (an indoor playground area for the kids) and Spo-cha concept. Targeting a wide range of customers from young children to the elderly, Round One continues to grow rapidly in the U.S. market.\nAs the number of Round One stores increase, sales and revenue have been quickly increasing as well. Through our new store expansions, Round One quickly building a solid brand awareness throughout the U.S. This type of approach to spread awareness of Round One is vital in becoming a national brand in the entertainment and amusement industry.\nVision & Values\nEveryday Fun for Everyone, Everywhere\nWe provide quality service with faces full of smiles!\nWe aim to provide endless entertainment to everyone, everywhere, in everyday life. To achieve this goal, we’re serious about FUN and creating a space where families, friends, coworkers, and couples alike can have a great, memorable time.\nWe believe our\ncore values\nwill continue to bring success and further growth to Round One.\nEntertainment:\nWe love to see smiles on all our guests and strive to entertain everyone.\nSincerity:\nWe work hard to maintain a fun and safe environment for all our guests and staff.\nPassion\n: We have the spirit and enthusiasm to challenge ourselves, pursue new and innovative technology and activities, and the will to continually create even more fun experiences!\nCompany Profile\nCompany Name\n- Round One Entertainment Inc.\nManagement Representative\n- President / Chief Executive Officer Hirotoshi Takahashi\nHead Office\n- 3070 Saturn Street, Suite 200, Brea, CA 92821\nDate of Establishment\n- April 2009\nPaid-In Capital\n- $165 million (As of March 31, 2023)\nShare Holder\n- Company Outline of Round One Corporation (Parent Company) Company History Round One Corporation (Parent Company)\nBusiness Description\n- Operates multi-amusement complexes with Bowling, Arcade Games, Karaoke, Billiards, Darts, Ping Pong, and Spo-cha (at select locations)\nNumber of Employees\n- 3,148 (As of December 2024)\nBusiness Year\n- 1 year commencing from April 1 of each year to March 31 of the following year\nWhat is Round1?\nRound1 Bowling & Arcade prides itself on offering guests ALL the fun under 1 roof.
