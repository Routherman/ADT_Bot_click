Brody helped us plan everything every step of the way and made the entire experience stress free, fun, and easy. From day one the communication was consistent and he answered each and every question I had along the way. The food was absolutely incredible, from the cocktail hour bites, to the buffet, to the prime rib carving station, huge sushi selection, and miniature dessert variety selection. The chef did such an amazing job and also made sure he adhered to the dietary restrictions of myself and my guests. Brody also coordinated a DJ for our reception and a Steel Drummer for our ceremony and cocktail hour. It was such a weight off my shoulders to not have to worry about coordinating with additional vendors.\nFor the wedding day, the staff was so helpful and friendly and put up all of our decorations for us. The venue is already so gorgeous and they elevated it to the next level for our big day. Sarah was instrumental in making sure all of the decor was laid out exactly how we wanted it and she added extra touches that made it look even better. The entire staff was so professional, kind, and fun. All 130 of my guests were served quickly throughout the night. I received so many compliments the next day from my friends and family saying how great the food, staff, and atmosphere were.\nOverall, I would highly recommend hosting any event at Hudson’s on the River. The food and view cannot be beat, and the staff is just exceptional. Working with Brody and Sarah was like having two professional wedding planners coordinate our big day. We had a perfect day at the perfect place\n​\nDanielle M\n/$\n$\nAlexa Young, CA\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nPlan your next event with us!\n/$\n$\n351 South West Flagler Ave, Stuart, FL 34994\n​\n772-266-8061 or Email Info@mlmfoodgroup.com\n/$\n$\nBoutique Weddings | Baby Showers | Birthday Parties | Business Functions | Healthcare Functions | Training Sessions & Seminars | Graduation Parties | Bridal Showers | Anniversary Celebrations | Holiday Events | Networking Luncheons | Fundraisers | Bar & Bat Mitzvahs | Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Parties\n/$\n$\nFirst Name\n/$\n$\nLast Name\n/$\n$\nPhone\n/$\n$\nEmail\n/$\n$\nSubject\n/$\n$\nTell Us About Your Event\n/$\n$\nSubmit\n/$\n$\nThanks for submitting!\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nPlan your next event with us!\n/$\n$\n351 South West Flagler Ave, Stuart, FL 34994\n​\n772-266-8061 or Email Info@mlmfoodgroup.com\n/$\n$\nBoutique Weddings | Baby Showers | Birthday Parties | Business Functions | Healthcare Functions | Training Sessions & Seminars | Graduation Parties | Bridal Showers | Anniversary Celebrations | Holiday Events | Networking Luncheons | Fundraisers | Bar & Bat Mitzvahs | Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Parties\n/$\n$\nFirst Name\n/$\n$\nLast Name\n/$\n$\nPhone\n/$\n$\nEmail\n/$\n$\nSubject\n/$\n$\nTell Us About Your Event\n/$\n$\nSubmit\n/$\n$\nThanks for submitting!\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\nWe hosted our wedding at Hudson’s on the River and everything was amazing.
