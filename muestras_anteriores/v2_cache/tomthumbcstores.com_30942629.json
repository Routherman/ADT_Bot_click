Jones established Walton Grocery Company with the goal of selling quality products and providing excellent convenient service. His first supermarket opened in De Funiak Springs, Florida. After that, W.C. began to experiment with the convenience store concept and soon opened his first convenience store in Crestview, Florida. Rapid growth followed as the company moved into the beach areas along the Florida Gulf coast and into small rural towns. Gasoline arrived on the convenience store scene and developed rapidly, becoming an integral part of the stores. In 1979, W.C. merged his company with two other family-owned companies to form Tom Thumb Food Stores – naming his son Rodney Jones President of the combined companies. The successful family business, which now comprised 84 stores, caught the eye of Dillon Companies, a subsidiary of The Kroger Company, and they acquired the Tom Thumb Food Stores in 1984. In 2018, EG Group acquired Kroger's convenience store business, thus adding the Tom Thumb stores to its portfolio of brands as part of its US operations.\nOur Parent Company\nWith more than 1,500 retail locations and 18,000 team members across the U.S., EG America is one of the fastest-growing convenience store retailers in the country. As the operator of Certified Oil, Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Kwik Shop, Loaf N’ Jug, Minit Mart, Sprint Food Stores, Tom Thumb, Turkey Hill, and Quik Stop stores, we are committed to becoming America’s preferred ‘one-stop’ destination by focusing on superior guest experience, high-quality grocery and fuel products, and supporting the communities we live and work in.\nEG America is owned by EG Group, a UK-based fuel station and convenience store retailer, with locations across the UK, Europe, Australia, and the U.S.\nDoing Good\nWe value our partnerships with DAV, American Cancer Society and the American Red Cross and with the generosity of our guests have helped raise millions of dollars over the last several years.\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nFind Us\nFood & Beverage\nNews\nSmartRewards\nNutrition\nBusiness Fuel Cards\nABOUT US\nTom Thumb is one of EG America’s convenience and retail brands with more than 115 store locations across Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.\nOur History\nIn the early 1950’s, W.C.
