Our group golf lessons and clinics are a great way for participants to either learn the game of golf, or simply hone their golf skills.\nWe can customize anything from a 2-hour short game clinic for 12 people that includes breakfast or lunch, to a half-day of short game and driver instruction for 50 followed by a dinner. We can also arrange an inter-office golf tournament followed by a lunch or dinner.\nOur pros deliver an excellent experience, no matter the event, and our restaurant staff will prepare and serve a wonderful meal when requested.

      "text": "About Us\nAbout Us\nCove Cay Golf Club is a top golf course in Tampa Bay. We’re known for challenging golf, gorgeous views, and incredible wildlife. We are a semi-public course with full practice facility and on property you’ll find a Clubhouse with men’s and women’s locker rooms, bar and restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, and a Golf Shop with a wide variety of men’s and women’s golf apparel, golf gear, and more.\nTogether, Bill and Pat Shriver have tackled the enormous task of returning the Cove Cay Golf Course and the Bayview Restaurant to the gem it once was decades ago. Many golfers as well as Club Members have enjoyed the upgrades to the course and Clubhouse,\nGolf Shop\nand\nBayview Grill\nover the years- and the improvements are ongoing. If you haven’t played at Cove Cay Golf Club in a while we hope you’ll stop by soon to play, dine, or meet the owners.\nPat Shriver is a PGA Pro and Cove Cay Golf Club Co-owner as well as Shriver Golf Academy Instructor. Pat has been a PGA Class A Golf Professional since 1995 and has been named Teacher Of The Year by the\nPGA North Florida\nand the North Florida West Central Chapter on numerous occasions.  She’s also competed in golf her entire life including junior golf, high school and college golf, then Futures Tour Golf and currently the North Florida PGA Section tournament golf.  Yet with all of her accomplishments, Pat is most proud of the successes her students have had playing golf over the years.  She’s coached many junior golfers to college golf, and one all the way to the LPGA tour. Because she has a lifetime relationship with her students she’s now coaching second generations of families and says, “It’s the consistency that wins golf tournaments.  It’s been so rewarding to see families play golf together and enjoy the game, and just as rewarding to see my students grow up playing golf and winning tournaments.\nBill Shriver is aPGA Pro, Cove Cay Golf Club Co-owner, as well as Shriver Golf Academy Instructor. Bill has been a PGA member since 1994.  He started playing golf with his father when he was a child, then he went on to play golf for West Virginia University before graduating and becoming a golf professional.  He worked in West Virginia as an Assistant Golf Professional for 6 years, then as a Head Golf Professional for 8 years.  Bill wore many hats, during his time there, doing everything from cart maintenance to shoe shining to merchandising to tournaments, so it’s fair to say he’s a pro at all aspects of golf, the game as well as the business.  Bill left his home state to move to Florida to work for the Wally Armstrong Golf Academy.  From there he worked at the Diamondback Golf Club, and the Ken Venturi Golf Academy before becoming the Director of Instruction at the Shriver Golf Academy, which he owns and operates with his partner in life and business, Pat McClanan- Shriver.\nCove Cay Golf Club is a family owned and operated golf course welcoming golfers of all skill levels and is open to the public.
