Together, they help foster a vibrant and thriving downtown for residents and visitors alike.\nMeet the staff and board members who are behind your favorite downtown elements.\nMeet Our\nStaff\nNatalie Kahler\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\nEmail:\ndirector@clermontdowntown.com\nNatalie began working with Clermont as a State consultant in October 2023 and immediately fell in love with the exceptional downtown.  One of her first jobs was to photograph every building in the downtown, so she spent weeks walking and exploring all Clermont had to offer. “From the beautiful lakes and rolling hills, to pristine historic buildings and well-manicured parks, downtown Clermont makes every place perfect for a photograph. Add to that the wide array of retail and restaurants and you have the recipe for a perfect Main Street community.”  In her new role as Executive Director, Natalie is glad to bring her years of experience in Main Street to help Clermont become an even better version of itself. Her favorite Clermont Main Street program is the art exhibit that will combine greater awareness of Clermont’s fascinating history with the talent of local artists.\nContact\nJennifer Christy\nEVENT COORDINATOR\nEmail:\njennchristy@clermontdowntown.com\nJenn has lived in Clermont since 1995 and has always been involved in the community. Her first job in the area was with the South Lake YMCA and since then she has volunteered with several community organizations.  Her favorite things about Clermont is how people show up to take care of each other - from fundraisers to physical labor, Clermont people get the job done!  She also loves all the lakes and the opportunities they provide. Of all the events she curates for Clermont Main Street, the weekly Farmers Market is her favorite. It’s wonderful “bringing in vendors that have worked really hard on their craft or their recipes and listening to the stories behind their small businesses. My favorite thing to hear at the end of the day is ‘it was a great day at the market.’” She loves that her job gives the community so many things to enjoy - an array of vendors, great brick and mortar businesses, and our beautiful downtown.\nContact\nFrankie Saunders\nSOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER & EVENT ASSISTANT\nEmail:\nrizman289@gmail.com\nA proud member of the Clermont community since 2020, Frankie is deeply passionate about the people, the local businesses, and the strong sense of connection that makes Clermont feel like home. Known for his energy, creativity, and community spirit, “The Rizman” has become a familiar face downtown—especially at the weekly Farmers Market, his favorite Clermont Main Street project. Whether supporting small businesses, highlighting local eats, or helping bring events to life, Frankie’s heart is always in building up the town he proudly calls home.  “There’s something special about the way everyone supports one another - it feels genuine.”\nContact\nMeet Our\nBoard\nMeghan Brummert\nSECRETARY & ORGANIZATION CHAIR\nMeghan Brummert moved to Clermont around 2015.  She especially loves Waterfront Park and all of the lakes Clermont has to offer.  When Clermont Main Street successfully wrote a grant to pay for an Historic Structure Survey, Meghan found the information in the almost 1000 page document fascinating.  Learning about the architecture and the stories of Clermont helped her feel even more connected to the community.  “I feel like the role of Clermont Main Street in the preservation and celebration of Clermont’s rich history is incredibly important.”\nBeth Merrick\nBOARD MEMBER\nBeth Merrick has lived in Clermont since 2003 and she loves the connections!  “Everywhere you turn, someone knows someone. I always know who to call, who to ask, who to reach out to. People are willing to jump into action, share, show up, and lend support and care. It’s all about the relationships.” Her favorite Clermont Main Street event is the monthly wine stroll because she has gotten to know the regular participants and volunteers that make it happen.  Beth said feedback is always positive and it’s fun to see people enjoying our beautiful downtown.\nKeith Mullins\nTREASURER\nKeith Mullins has been a resident in Clermont since 1988 and has served on Clermont City Council.  He opened his shop, Bacchus Vino Etcetera, in 2004 and it has become a downtown staple.  He appreciates the people of Clermont and the spirit they bring to their life - individually and collectively. He believes Clermont Main Street  can work as a bridge between government, the merchants, and the residents.  Keith says downtown “can be a powerful agent for positive change.”\nAmanda Nethero\nBOARD MEMBER\nAmanda Nethero has lived in Clermont since 2005. She loves Clermont’s small town feel and charm and all the memories those help her create. Some of her favorite memories include bringing her kiddos downtown during the holidays for the festivals and Christmas parade.  Amanda is passionate about Clermont Main Street’s events.  “I have a special place in my heart for our events.

Add to that the wide array of retail and restaurants and you have the recipe for a perfect Main Street community.”  In her new role as Executive Director, Natalie is glad to bring her years of experience in Main Street to help Clermont become an even better version of itself. Her favorite Clermont Main Street program is the art exhibit that will combine greater awareness of Clermont’s fascinating history with the talent of local artists.\nContact\nJennifer Christy\nEVENT COORDINATOR\nEmail:\njennchristy@clermontdowntown.com\nJenn has lived in Clermont since 1995 and has always been involved in the community.

Of all the events she curates for Clermont Main Street, the weekly Farmers Market is her favorite. It’s wonderful “bringing in vendors that have worked really hard on their craft or their recipes and listening to the stories behind their small businesses. My favorite thing to hear at the end of the day is ‘it was a great day at the market.’” She loves that her job gives the community so many things to enjoy - an array of vendors, great brick and mortar businesses, and our beautiful downtown.\nContact\nFrankie Saunders\nSOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER & EVENT ASSISTANT\nEmail:\nrizman289@gmail.com\nA proud member of the Clermont community since 2020, Frankie is deeply passionate about the people, the local businesses, and the strong sense of connection that makes Clermont feel like home.

This approach is made up of four committees with the following goals:\nOrganization\n: Creating a strong foundation for sustainable revitalization through partnerships, community involvement, and resource development.\nPromotion\n: Positioning downtown as the center of community life and economic activity, while promoting a positive image and unique identity.\nDesign\n: Enhancing the physical and visual character of downtown through thoughtful design and preservation.\nEconomic Vitality\n: Strengthening and growing the district’s economy through market-based business development strategies.\nFlorida Main Street\nFlorida Main Street\nis a technical assistance program aimed at revitalizing historic downtowns and encouraging economic development while preserving historic character.\nEstablished in 1985, the program supports over 40 communities across Florida through a network affiliated with the\nNational Main Street Center\n.\nFlorida Main Street is administered by the Division of Historical Resources under the Florida Department of State and follows the Main Street Four-Point Approach®.\nDiscover Downtown Clermont\nDowntown Clermont is a Florida Main Street district and part of a network of 1,200 Main Street America communities. And while the city will continue to be the energetic and inclusive Choice of Champions, Downtown Clermont is now unveiling its own unique brand and identity within the city.\nWe’re excited to introduce the new Downtown Clermont brand which brings back “Gem of the Hills” and unites it with Downtown’s other intrinsic feature, “Lure of the Lake.” It’s symbolic of old versus new…and authentic to the history that makes this destination within Clermont so special. But don’t take our word for it…come on Downtown and see for yourself.\nAwards & Recognition\nSecretary of State names Clermont Florida Main Street Program of the Month, August 2022\nWorld Atlas Best Downtowns in Florida\n25 Years of Tree City USA\nDEP Designated Outstanding Florida Waters\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nTerms + Conditions\n|\nCookies Policy\n|\nAccessibility Statement\nContact\n|\nAbout\n|\nDonate\n|\nVolunteer\n© 2025 Clermont Main Street.
