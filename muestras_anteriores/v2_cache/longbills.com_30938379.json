We rely on the freshest Gulf of Mexico seafood for our flavor-filled menu. And we know you’ll love what we have to offer.\nThe story of Longbills can’t be told without Toucan’s on the Beach. When Hurricane Michael devastated Mexico Beach in 2018, our beloved Toucan’s was destroyed. But the outpouring of love, including shared memories, and a sense of community lives on LongBills.\nSo, with the return of Toucan’s on hold decided to bring that Toucan’s spirit to Cape San Blas. Renovations began on a little blue house, and the anticipation started to build. And now here we are, bringing you the best place for seafood on the Forgotten Coast.\nNew restaurant and new location. Same great food and the same great vibes.\n/$\n$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\nSunday breakfast was great. Pancakes were huge, coffee was hot and my cup was never empty. Service was super quick. We wish more people knew about the weekend breakfast, as a property owner in this area we need to fight to keep places like this on the cape.\n/$\n$\n- Katie S.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\nIf you are ever in the Cape San Blas area, this is the place to eat. Food and service is unbeatable.\n/$\n$\nPhil G.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\nThank goodness for LongBill's! We spent a week on Cape San Blas and they were the only restaurant consistently open all week. We ended up eating there multiple times so we were able to try pizzas, seafood, appetizers, burgers, and more. The food was all good quality and tasted great. The atmosphere is low key and good for families.\n/$\n$\nRachel P.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\nAbsolutely amazing!!! Service was excellent! Food was terrific! The catch of the day was Flounder, and it was mouth-watering. We are here on vacation, and will be back again!! Highly recommend.\n/$\n$\nJay S.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\nBest seafood I've had in a long time.\n/$\n$\nRandal T.\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\n/$\n$\nWe ordered a few appetizers, and they did not disappoint! The drunken shrimp was amazing, and they have a good beer selection.
