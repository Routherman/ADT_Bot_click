In the past we have hosted dance classes, music concerts, theatrical events, business and organization meetings and private parties - even hosting a few weddings right on our main-stage!  If you are interested in renting a space at\nMarathon Community Theatre or Marathon Community Cinema\n, please contact our General Manager at\ngm@marathontheater.org\nfor our pricing and rental information.\nMarathon Community Theatre's Mission Statement\nOur aim is to produce engaging, inspiring, high quality theatrical productions that entertain our diverse community of local citizens, seasonal residents and large tourist population; train and support the next generation of theatre artists; provide arts education programs that promote life-long learning to our local community; and celebrate the essential power of the arts to illuminate our common humanity.\nMCT BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n2025/2026 SEASON\nLINDA SCHAEFER - President\nALEX RICKERT - Vice President of Production\nPAIGE KURTZ- Executive Vice President\nJENNIFER DAVIS - Treasurer\nDALE COBURN - Secretary\nABBI COLELLA\nJOHN HUNT\nGEORGE LANCASTER\nKIM MOMALY\nJOSH MOTHNER\nSEAN SAYER\nPHIL VACHON\nACCOLADES & AWARDS\nLearn more\nCopyright © 2021 Marathon Community Theatre - All Rights Reserved.\nMarathon Community Theatre is a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization.\nCINEMA\nSEASON  MEMBERSHIP\nBECOME A VOLUNTEER\nDANCE DEPARTMENT\nABOUT US\nDONATE HERE!\nMCT SUPPORTERS\nPowered by",
