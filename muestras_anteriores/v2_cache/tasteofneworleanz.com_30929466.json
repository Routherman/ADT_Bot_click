It is left here only so we don't break old sites. Don't copy it to new layouts\nAbout Us\nMy husband and I were born and raised in small towns in Louisiana. We grew up knowing the importance of family, community, and Louisianan pride in creating great food! When people visit Louisiana, everyone wants to feed them. This is simply how we show love down there. We put so much into our food, and sacred recipes are passed down from generation to generation. My husband worked as an Assistant Chef in New Orleans and really learned the secrets to good, authentic Cajun Seafood. We would search for our beloved authentic Louisiana cuisine from state to state and have found it's really hard to find a taste of home anywhere else.\n​\nOne day we just decided we wanted to share some of our memories of great quality food with our new Florida Community. From there we created \"Taste of New Orleanz\". We live in a great community and the love and support we have experienced is priceless!! We put our all into our food, and we are so happy and excited to be able to share it with our New Community!!\nHere's Our Menu\nOrder Now!\nCall 678-522-5924\nF\no\nl\nl\no\nw\nUs\nStay in touch with us on social media and find out more about what we do.\nCall Us\nCall us: +1 352-593-4779\nMonday\nClosed\nTue - Thu\n11:00 am\n-\n7:00 pm\nFri - Sat\n11:00 am\n-\n8:00 pm\nSunday\n12:00 pm\n-\n5:00 pm\nWhere to Find Us\nWhere to find us: 809 South Broad Street Brooksville FL 34601, United States\nFind us\nAdd full CSS and Javascript before the close tag of the body if needed\n========= JS Section =========\nLoad jQuery\nEnd Load jQuery\nInjecting site-wide before scripts\nEnd Injecting site-wide to the head\nHEAD RT JS Include\nEnd of HEAD RT JS Include\nphotoswipe markup\nRoot element of PhotoSwipe.
