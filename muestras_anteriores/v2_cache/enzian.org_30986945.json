Enzian exists to entertain, inspire, educate, and connect the community through film. It is a member supported, non-profit cultural organization and all proceeds from membership fees, ticket sales, and food and beverage go toward supporting its mission.\nEnzian is a single-screen cinema café offering mostly independent & foreign films with two unique dining options and a variety of special programming. At Enzian, you will experience a fusion of food and film.\nOur History\nSurrounded by weeping oaks, a bubbling fountain, and a beautiful courtyard, Enzian is a unique movie-going experience. As Central Florida’s only full-time, not-for-profit alternative cinema, Enzian exists to entertain, inspire, educate, and connect the community through film. For more than 30 years, Enzian has championed the belief that “Film Is Art.” Along with first-run independent features, Enzian offers a variety of special events, such the nationally-recognized Florida Film Festival.\nFounded by Tina Tiedtke and the Tiedtke family in 1985, Enzian began as a repertory house offering six to 12 classic films each week as well as the occasional live show (musician Philip Glass was one of the most notable bookings on Enzian’s stage). By 1989 Enzian had refocused and moved into the then-risky field of showing first-run independent features. Enzian was alone in the community in booking such films, but this bold transformation was a success. With strong support from regional film-lovers, Enzian now often reports the highest grosses in Florida for many art house releases. Adventurous programming, and a willingness to book self-distributed films, has garnered Enzian a national reputation as a trendsetting venue. Time and time again, Enzian has proven that even in a community as mainstream as Orlando, there is an audience hungry for new voices in independent film.\n/#content\n/#wrap\nTICKETS START AT\nRegular $12.50\nStudent/Senior/Military (with ID) $11.00\nMatinees $11.00\nFilm Society Members $10.00\nCONTACT\n1300 South Orlando Avenue\nMaitland, FL 32751\nInfo Line: (407) 629-0054\nTheater Offices: (407) 629-1088\nAbout\n|\nCOVID-19 Safety\n|\nFAQ\n|\nMission + Leadership\n|\nTheater Rental\n|\nVolunteer\n|\nPress\n|\nJobs\n|\nPrivacy\n|\nContact\n|\nHome\nCalendar\nDonate\nFood\nInclude plugins.js - Bootstrap and Modernizr",
