Currently, we have 204 beers on tap and over 1000 different bottle varieties in multiple vintages. Our draft list is changed and updated daily and it features beer, cider and mead from many different breweries, styles and vintage offerings from around our city, state, country and world, including 24 beers from Belgium on tap in our basement.  With 204 offerings on tap, there is certainly something for everyone. Check out our current draft list to see what we have on tap today. We have been the cornerstone of King street in historic Riverside/Avondale since 2005.\nKickbacks Gastropub\nKickbacks Gastropub\nis the name of our original dining space that served us (sort of) well since 2005.  For many years, due to popular demand, our tiny little kitchen was not able to serve food in a timely manner to our loyal guests.  But somehow, many of our customers have stuck with us through the years and we have finally rewarded them with a new dining space which we call “Goozlepipe & Guttyworks”.  We built a new kitchen, 6 times the size of our old kitchen, in our new building and converted our old kitchen into a private dining room called “the dugout”, nestled between the two main dining spaces with a great view of Goozlepipe & Guttyworks.  Kickbacks has 20 TV’s for your viewing pleasure.\nGoozlepipe & Guttyworks\nAttached to our original, 100 year old building, is our new, 3 level addition.  The new building includes our expanded bar, new kitchen, a main dining room with mezzanine seating and a stage, a Belgian inspired basement and a covered outdoor patio.   The main dining room has the feel of a steampunk museum featuring sculptures from Jim Smith, paintings and murals by Grant Thornton and blacksmithing from David Ponsler…all friends and local artists.  1.1 million pennies provide the backdrop for the artwork, all hand glued, installed in just over 8,000 labor hours over a 10 month period.\nThe Belguim Basement\nOur basement beneath\nGoozlepipe & Guttyworks\nfeatures a Belgian inspired bar and dining space, private dining room, private beer lockers and a network of refrigerated beer “catacombs” where we store over 100,000 vintage bottles and kegs of beer\nCopyright © 2025 Kickbacks Gastropub/Goozlepipe & Guttyworks - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by\nHome\nDraft Beer List\nOrder Online\nEvent Booking\nVintage Beer",
