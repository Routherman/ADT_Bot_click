After all, getting everyone at your office together shouldn't be so difficult!\nWhat do you bring to a painting party?\nPlanning a painting party for your next team outing is easy. We provide you with all things painting, such as brushes, paint, canvases, and even an instructor! All you have to do is bring your team, a can-do attitude, and some of your favorite beverages and snacks. Our BYOB* paint studios let you choose what beverage your team will enjoy. Whether it's wine, beer, coffee, or cocktails, your team can paint and sip to their hearts' content. Group bonding has never been more fun!\n*Call your local studio to learn about their alcohol policy.\nWhat if not everyone is an artist?\nSo, maybe not everyone on your team is the next Picasso. At Painting with a Twist, that doesn't matter! Your painting party is about making\nfun\nart, not\nfine\nart. Our casual atmosphere and guided painting sessions leave plenty of room for you and your team to bond.\nCan any team sign up for a painting party?\nTeam building events aren't reserved for work functions and office events! Any team can partake in the joys of painting and drinking. Give you and your sports team a break from practicing. Your dance team can step up to the canvas. The debate team can argue whose self-portrait is better. The neighborhood watch club can observe and report on each other's paintings. The list goes on! No matter what you and your team do, you've got a place at one of our studios.\nCan I host a painting team building event at our office?\nYes! Let us bring the team building to you. Painting is one of the best on-site team building activities and many of our studios offer on-site painting events. You provide the space and we'll provide all the materials, just like we would in our own studio!\nContact your local studio\nfor more details for hosting an on-site team building event at the office or the venue of your choice.\nHow do I book a painting party team building event?\nStop browsing online for creative team building ideas that are all played out. Turn your team into Twisters for a fresh experience that will have everyone bonding in no time! Scroll down and pick a studio. Contact us and we'll work with you to select the perfect piece of art or type of mural for your private painting party. Trust us. It'll be a game changer.\nBook your event now!",
