Three ghostly brides surface from bathtubs full of water, to gather evidence against their womanizing, murderous, husband by reliving the shocking events leading up to their deaths. As they make their case, they discover how they have been victimized not only by George Joseph Smith, but also by society at large. Full of rich images, a myriad of characters, a quirky sense of humour and lyrical language, The Drowning Girls is both breathtaking fantasia and social critique.\nJulius Caesar\nShowing February 20 - March 15, 2026\nAuditions: December 7-8, 2025\n-\nBy William Shakespeare\nDirected by Early Whitaker\n-\nA would-be emperor.

Gurney\nDirected by Ian Hales\n-\nGreg and Kate have moved to Manhattan after twenty-two years of child-raising in the suburbs. Greg brings home a dog he found in the park—or that has found him—bearing only the name “Sylvia” on her name tag. A street-smart mixture of Lab and poodle, Sylvia becomes a major bone of contention between husband and wife. She offers Greg an escape from the frustrations of his job and the unknowns of middle age. To Kate, Sylvia becomes a rival for affection. And Sylvia thinks Kate just doesn’t understand the relationship between man and dog. The marriage is put in serious jeopardy and the audience is put in serious stitches. Will Greg and Kate (and Sylvia) survive this mess?\nfor colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf\nShowing May 15 - 31, 2026\nAuditions: February 22-23, 2026\n-\nBy Ntozake Shange\nDirected by Jay Nixon\n-\nA series of poetic monologues accompanied by dance and music, for colored girls weaves interconnected stories of love, empowerment, struggle and loss into a complex representation of sisterhood.

They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple.\nCompany\nShowing  June 19 - July 12, 2026\nAuditions: April 12-13, 2026\n-\nMusic and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Book by George Furth\nDirected by Brandon Hall\n-\nOn the night of his 35th birthday, confirmed bachelor, Robert, contemplates his unmarried state. Over the course of a series of dinners, drinks and even a wedding, his friends – \"those good and crazy people [his] married friends\" – explain the pros and cons of taking on a spouse. The habitually single Robert is forced to question his adamant retention of bachelorhood during a hilarious array of interactions.\nFrom musical theatre's most renowned composer, Company is largely regarded as a trailblazer of the dark-comedy, modern-musical genre and the winner of six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Score, Best Lyrics and Best Book.\nInterested in getting a deal on tickets?\nYou can buy a season ticket at any time.
