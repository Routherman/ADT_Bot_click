The history of the association is explain in details below.\nHistory\nIn the early 1970’s black golfers were having problems playing organized golf in the state of Florida. In 1972, Robert Saffold of Sebring, Florida talked with several black golfers during the “Sephia Open (Pro-Am) Golf Tournament” being held in Sebring at the Harder Hall Golf Course. During this meeting, the golfers discussed the formation of a statewide organization that all black golfers could join and participate in friendly tournament competition. Included among this pioneering group of black golfers were Ed Henry, Ernest King, James Hastie, Danny Sutton, Eddie Postell, Leonard Wilson and Robert Saffold. This notable list of golfers noted that several cities in Florida at that time had established tournaments such as Tampa (Rogers Park), Jacksonville (Moncreif), Ocala (Compton #2), and Miami (North/South @ Miami Springs). They started the dialogue which led to this concept becoming a reality.\nSunshine State Amateur Golf Association (SSAGA)\nThe SSAGA is the only principally African-American statewide association of male and female golfers in United States. It is now comprised of thirteen (13) clubs and involves approximately 1,000 golfers of all ethnicities from Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Orlando, Naples/Ft. Myers, St. Petersburg, Sarasota, Ft. Pierce/Vero Beach, Titusville, Sebring, Lakeland, and St. Augustine. Through regularly scheduled tournaments, members, and associate members display camaraderie with those who love the game. The SSAGA contributes more than $800,000 annually to Florida’s economy through the hosting of local and state tournaments and other golf related activities.\nDONATIONS\nTo make a monetary/financial donation to\nPar 5 Golf Club of the Treasure Coast, Inc.\nPlease click the link below, print and mail today.
