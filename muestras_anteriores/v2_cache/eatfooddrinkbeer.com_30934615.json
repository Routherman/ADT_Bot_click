Everything here is made from scratch with top-notch, locally-sourced ingredients, because frozen food belongs in sad office lunches, not on your plate. We cook like we mean it—with love, a little magic, and a serious commitment to flavor. Come taste the difference… your taste buds (and your Instagram feed) will thank you.\nCasey and Mike’s story starts back in the early 2000s, when they first crossed paths at a restaurant—Mike was a hungry server, and Casey was holding it down as the kitchen manager. What started as a solid working relationship turned into a real friendship, and before long, they were helping launch restaurants up and down Florida’s West Coast.\nBy 2017, they were ready to bring their own vision to life. They landed in Gulf Gate, a laid-back Sarasota neighborhood that felt like the perfect home for what they had in mind.\nTheir goal? Keep it simple: serve up seriously good, scratch-made food that everyone can enjoy—whether you're vegetarian, health-focused, or just plain hungry. The menu is a la carte, affordable, and built for mixing, matching, and trying something new. And because they’ve both lived the hospitality life, they stay open late so folks getting off a shift can grab a bite to eat or a drink after work.\nSCRATCH KITCHEN\nSCRATCH KITCHEN\nSCRATCH KITCHEN\nAt Food + Beer, we don’t mess with shortcuts—unless we’re talking about the kind that get you to a cold beer faster.
