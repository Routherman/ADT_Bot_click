I brought my granddaughter and we walked the Junk in the trunk section, and then went on to pick strawberries, which turned out to be soooo sweet and delicious. My granddaughter also got to play on the playground. We love how all the equipment was made with 'farm' equipment. Last we rode the tractor ride to the country store. I had the best time and so did my granddaughter. Hopefully this will not be the last time I can visit Brown & Brown Farms. I look forward to the next time I can bring my granddaughter.\nM.
