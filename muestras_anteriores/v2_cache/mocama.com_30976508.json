      "text": "Our Beer\nCosmico India Pale Ale\nAvailable Year-Round\n7.0% ABV    69 IBUs\nCosmico was designed for those seeking refreshment and balance in a modern American IPA. Over the course of 14 months as we built Mocama, extensive R&D on our pilot brewing system drove us towards this IPA that combines fruit forward flavors and aroma with a crisp, thirst quenching drinkability. This beer starts with an agreeable, slightly toasty malt backbone that tones down the bitterness you may recall from the IPAs of yesteryear. The unique ester profile of the “Conan” yeast strain is reminiscent of peaches and serves as a perfect complement to the bright citrus and juicy tropical fruit aromas of Sultana and Citra hops. For bittering, we chose the dual-purpose El Dorado hop varietal to impart a balanced bitterness along with flavors of pear and watermelon.\nAvailable in a 6 pack of 12 oz. cans.\nGrains:\nTwo Row Malt, Flaked Oats, Flaked Wheat\nHops:\nCitra, El Dorado, Sultana\nYeast:\nDIPA Ale\nDune Garden American Lager\nAvailable Year-Round\n5.0% ABV   25 IBUs\nThe statement may be too simplistic to say that an American lager is simply a refreshing, thirst-quenching delivery vehicle in a glass. Craft lager has provided nuance and finesse to the American drinker, and emerging from a sea of lagers in the market is dune garden. Pilsner malt on the nose mingled with noble hop aromatics meld seamlessly with notes of citrus and herbal spice to deliver the new world craft lager drinking experience.\nAvailable in a 6 pack of 12 oz. cans.\nGrains:\nPilsner, Vienna, Flaked Maize\nHops:\nSouthern Cross, Hallertau Mandarina, Hallertau Calista\nYeast:\nGerman Lager\nProsím Pilsner\nAvailable Year-Round\n5% ABV       38 IBUs\nInspired by exceedingly drinkable Czech pilsners we all know and love, Prosim is unfiltered and delicately dry hopped. Our goal was to strike a balance between the familiar bitterness of Saaz and the florality and fruitiness of Grungeist, a relatively new German aroma hop that in this recipe imparts the smallest amount of peach, lemon, and passion fruit. The Saaz in this case is Michigan grown Zuper Saazer.\nAvailable in a 6 pack of 12 oz. cans.\nGrains:\nPilsen Malt, Vienna Malt, and Caramel Malt\nHops:\nMagnum, Zuper Saazer, and Grungiest\nYeast:\nGerman Lager\nModer\nAvailable Year-Round\n5.3%ABV   55 IBUs\nOur Vienna-style lager pours a brilliant light amber and boasts complex notes of toasted bread with hints of caramelized honey and pretzel. Low malt sweetness supports a clean, crisp bitterness.\nAvailable in a 6 pack of 12 oz. cans.\nMalt:\nSuperior Pilsen, Vienna, Biscuit, Caramel Munich, And Chocolate\nHops:\nHallertau Magnum, Hallertau Blanc, Saaz\nYeast:\nGerman Lager\nRare Cargo\nAvailable Seasonally\n8-10%ABV   85 IBUs\nRare Cargo is our rotating Double IPA series highlighting different hops with each iteration. Each version is Double Dry-hopped heavily with a totally different hop bill. This monster typically delivers big hits of tropical fruits, fresh-squeezed citrus, notes of white grapes, tangelos and passionfruit all while staying within its sturdy malt frame. Bold but balanced.\nAvailable in a 4 pack of 16 oz. cans.\nMalts:\n2-Row, Malted Oats, Flaked Oats, Flaked Wheat\nHops:\nVol 9 (Amarillo, Centennial, Chinook)\nYeast:\nCosmic Punch\nWhat We Do\nWe aim to create exceptional batch beer that is equal parts technical precision and creative art.
