Team Sanibel has raised over $10,000 thanks to your support and is ranked 10th overall, to date, in funds raised by\nTower Climb teams.\nAs you know, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation has held the Tower Climb at One World Trade Center in New York City since 2015. About one thousand participants climb 104 stories each year, symbolizing strength, hope, and the resiliency of the American spirit. The event celebrates the life and sacrifice of all 9/11 heroes, including FDNY firefighter Stephen Siller and FDNY Captain Billy Burke.\nWhile we have not reached our goal or raised as much as last year yet, we each beat our times from last year. We started the climb at One World Trade Center at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and finished less than 30 minutes later. Jeff reached the top after 28.28 minutes, and John reached the top in 29.29 minutes.\nAfter the climb, Team Sanibel was invited to breakfast at O’Hara’s Restaurant and Pub, the pub known as the place to remember 9/11. The pub is located two blocks from the World Trade Center and next door to Firehouse, Engine Company 10, and Ladder Company 10, which was the first FDNY station to respond to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It was an honor to be at O’Hara’s and among so many heroes and their supporters, remembering those who have given their all to preserve our safety, freedoms, and way of life.\nThanks again for your support! We are very honored to be a part of this event and support the Tunnel to Towers Foundation’s mission to provide mortgage-free homes to fallen first responders and Gold Star families with children and the ultimate eradication of veteran homelessness.

In this key role, Baker supports the Executive Director and works collaboratively with leadership, staff, and volunteers to advance the mission of FISH.\nBaker brings extensive professional experience in human resources and administration to the organization. Most recently, she served as Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer at Family Health Centers of Southwest Florida, where she oversaw HR operations for over 675 employees.\nOver her decade-long career at Family Health Centers, Baker held various HR roles, leading strategic initiatives that included professional development programs and community partnerships to support employee growth and engagement.\n“Kim’s steady presence, strong organizational skills, and warm personality are already making a difference,” says Maria Espinoza, FISH Executive Director. “She’s the kind of person who gets things done—and does it with heart. We’re lucky to have her on board.”\nWhen asked what drew her to FISH, Baker said, “I’m honored to be part of an organization that embodies the true spirit of ‘neighbors helping neighbors.'”\n“Having witnessed FISH’s compassionate care through my grandmother’s experience with their delivery services and medical equipment loan program, I know firsthand the incredible difference this organization makes in people’s lives,” she said. “Any opportunity to support our island community while using my skills to help others is deeply meaningful to me.”\nOutside of work, Baker enjoys biking, gardening, staying active through health and fitness, and exploring local restaurants across Sanibel and Captiva. Baker is also a member of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, and a graduate of the Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce Leadership Program.

In this key role, Baker supports the Executive Director and works collaboratively with leadership, staff, and volunteers to advance the mission of FISH.\nBaker brings extensive professional experience in human resources and administration to the organization. Most recently, she served as Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer at Family Health Centers of Southwest Florida, where she oversaw HR operations for over 675 employees.\nOver her decade-long career at Family Health Centers, Baker held various HR roles, leading strategic initiatives that included professional development programs and community partnerships to support employee growth and engagement.\n“Kim’s steady presence, strong organizational skills, and warm personality are already making a difference,” says Maria Espinoza, FISH Executive Director. “She’s the kind of person who gets things done—and does it with heart. We’re lucky to have her on board.”\nWhen asked what drew her to FISH, Baker said, “I’m honored to be part of an organization that embodies the true spirit of ‘neighbors helping neighbors.'”\n“Having witnessed FISH’s compassionate care through my grandmother’s experience with their delivery services and medical equipment loan program, I know firsthand the incredible difference this organization makes in people’s lives,” she said. “Any opportunity to support our island community while using my skills to help others is deeply meaningful to me.”\nOutside of work, Baker enjoys biking, gardening, staying active through health and fitness, and exploring local restaurants across Sanibel and Captiva.
