C.A.P. volunteers patrol the unincorporated areas of the county using specially marked golf carts and patrol cars acting as extra eyes and ears for law enforcement. C.A.P. volunteers are provided with uniforms. Volunteers do not carry weapons and have no law enforcement powers. All C.A.P. volunteers are subjected to background checks and must participate in training. There are 67 C.A.P. communities throughout the county.\nNot only are they in the unincorporated areas of the county, but also in the cities of Lakeland, Winter Haven, Haines City, Lake Wales, and Dundee. This extremely successful program assists the Sheriff ’s Office in deterring crime by providing highly visible patrols who report suspicious activities to the Emergency Communications Center and district supervisors.\nFor more information on volunteer opportunities or the C.A.P. program, ask any volunteer wearing the CAP T-Shirt or driving a CAP vehicle.  In addition, you can call Volunteer Services at 863-298-6681 to obtain an application, then send it to: PCSO Volunteer Services Unit, 1891 Jim Keene Blvd, Winter Haven, FL, 33880.\nPages\nHome\nAmenities\nContact Us\nHighland Fairways Location\nHomes for Sale\nLife in Highland Fairways\nLocal Points of Interest\nBok Tower\nCircle B Bar Reserve\nDetroit Tigers - 03/10/19\nBlue Spring State Natural Feature\nLake Parker Park\nCommunity Renovations\nActivities & Resources\nCitizens Assisted Patrol (CAP)\nMore about the CAP Program\nCAP Forms\nCAP Articles & Videos of Interest\nLPD Community Newsletters\nCommunity Governance\nDeclaration of Restrictions\nDOR Amended-Restated 4.20.22\nHistorical DOR by Phase\nPhase Map\nPhase I\nPhase II\nPhase II-A\nPhase III-A\nPhase III-B\nPhase III-C\nFinance\nGoverning Documents\nApplication For Residency\nArticles of Incorporation\nBy-laws\nPet Registration\nCommunity Photos\nHurricane Milton 10-9-24\nDances\nHearts on Fire Dance 02/15/25\nNew Year’s Eve 2024\nGroovin' around the Christmas Tree\nHaunted Happenings 10/26/24\nDisco Party and Dance\nGolf\nChip & Putt - 02/27/23\nShowcase of Champions 04/07/2024\nLadies Golf and Social Banquet 2024\nLadies' Invitational - 02/12/19\nBoys & Girls Club Golf Scramble\nCancer Awareness 02/07/2023\nLadies Golf Lunch\nSpecial Events\n4th of July Golf Cart Parade 7/4/25\nNeil Diamond Show 02/14/25\nCommunity Dinner and Show 1/19/2025\nSanta's Village 12-07-24\nGirls Night Out 11/02/2024\nPool Party 7.27.24\nGlamorous Illusions 02/10/2024\nFamily Feud - 01/27/2024\nAll That Glitters 12-02-23\nLight Up the Night 11/25/2022\nThanksgiving Dinner 11/24/2022\nHalloween Parade - 10/31/2023\nSpring Concert - 03/25/2023\nVolunteer Pizza Party 03/14/2022\nState Parties\nMidwest States 02/22/2025\nMichigan - 02/01/2025\nNew York - 03/23/2025\nVeterans Activities\nMemorial Day 2025\nVeterans Day Ceremony - 11/11/2021\nPulled Pork Dinner - 11/14/2019\nHF Ladies Golf League\nLadies Golf Board\nLadies Golf Governing Documents\nHandicaps\nYear End Awards\nTuesday 18 Hole Golf\nPAR-Tee Ladies\nRule of the Week\nTournaments\nSpecial Events\nLuncheons\nGolf\nCouples Golf\nSaturday Golf\nMen's Golf Association\nSaturday Golf\nScrambles\nTravel Adventures\nPhoto's of Past Trips\nVeterans\nrow content\ncontainer-fluid\nCopyright © 2025.
