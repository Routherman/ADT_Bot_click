We offer breathtaking settings around the world, from beachfront to mountaintop to city center, with venues to accommodate a guest list of any size. Guided by our event specialists, you’ll curate a personalized menu with a local touch and experiences that will leave guests with lasting memories.\nimagebreaker (fullwidth) or imagebreaker (fullwidth) + caption\nimagebreaker (leftaligned) + caption or collage breaker + caption\nother than full width image\nimagebreaker (leftaligned) + caption\nSense of Taste\nBuilding on personal preferences and seasonal offerings, catering is an opportunity to tell a story through original culinary and mixology experiences. Each meal — whether it’s a coffee break, a lunch buffet or a plated dinner — is a sensory experience intended to create a lasting memory for your guests.\nImmersive Experiences\nBonds are reinforced when experiences are shared together. Create connections among guests with master classes, interactive breaks and local excursions that take guests outside of the boardroom or ballroom and immerse them in the authenticity of the destination.\nAttention to Detail\nEvents are our passion and purpose, inspiring us to both anticipate needs and introduce elements of surprise to delight you and your guests. Our goal is to weave together an experience that becomes a part of your guests’ journey — one rooted in the destination and brought to life by unique, personalized details.\nBeyond the Boardroom\nBringing people together can be as simple as gathering around a table or as ambitious as filling ballroom. At The Ritz-Carlton, events weave together exceptional service and immersive, sensory experiences to create meetings and retreats that engage emotions and inspire personal stories.\nPlan Your Gathering\nA Day to Remember\nA wedding is both a singular day and a lifelong memory. At The Ritz-Carlton, every celebration is distinctive and personal, reflecting your journey through each carefully orchestrated detail. Whether your vision is to exchange vows surrounded by snow-capped mountains, where the ocean meets the sand or beneath the sparkle of a majestic chandelier, we offer locations around the world or close to home.\nBegin Your Love Story\nJourney Into\nInspiring Venues\n01\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Pune\n02\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Aruba\n03\nThe Ritz-Carlton Hotel de la Paix, Geneva\n04\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Doha\n05\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Georgetown\n06\nDorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve\n07\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong\nPrevious\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNext\n1\n7\nCareers\nThe Ritz-Carlton Club\nShops\nThe Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center\nMarriott Bonvoy\nContact\nMedia Contact\nPrivacy Center\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYoutube\nEnglish\nRITZ® is a Registered Service Mark of The Ritz Hotel, Limited, and is used by The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company under License.\n© 2025 The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C.
