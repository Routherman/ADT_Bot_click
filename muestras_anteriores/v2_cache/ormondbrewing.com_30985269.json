After many successful brew trials and errors, he recognized that Ormond Beach, a city rich in history, lacked a craft beer culture. He embarked on the Journey to start Ormond Brewing Company in November 2012. After countless hours of hard work, Ormond Brewing Company became Volusia County’s first brewery in September 2013. Since then the tasting room has tripled in size and we have added our own Ormond Craft Kitchen. We now have 18 house brewed craft beers on tap along with a selection of wines and homemade root beer. Our expanded area is available for private events and we have a catering menu.\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nCONTACT US\normondbrewingevents@gmail.com\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nSuccess!
