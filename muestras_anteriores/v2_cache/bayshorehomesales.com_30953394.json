I'm so impressed with the management as well as the vibe of the place. Quiet, clean and well equipped and managed homes.\nRose C. - Country Club Estates, UT\nI have been a resident of Thornton Estates for over ten years, and could not be happier. The park is kept clean, the staff is friendly and responsive, and have gone above and beyond to make sure the residents are taken care of. During the pandemic, they made sure to update us on the latest news, they found places to bring food in to those residents that were trying to navigate not going anywhere and trying to stay safe. They also helped those of us that were having trouble with rent, making sure we had access to organizations that would help. I've never lived somewhere where the resident's needs were first and foremost. The manager at Thornton Estates has become someone I could count on while I suffered through a major health crisis. Without her help and intervention, I don't know what I would have done. If you're considering moving in, don't hesitate. You won't regret it.\nLaura H. - Thornton, CO\nVery peaceful and clean .
