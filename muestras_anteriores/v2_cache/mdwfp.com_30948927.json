      "text": "Our Mission\nThe mission of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks is to conserve and enhance Mississippi’s wildlife, fisheries, and parks, provide quality outdoor recreation, and engage the public in natural resource conservation.\nHistory\nMississippi's legislative leadership recognized the need for wildlife conservation in our state and founded the Mississippi Game and Fish Commission in 1932. Since then, the Agency has been the state's premier conservation organization.\nIn 1989, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation merged with the Mississippi Department of Wildlife Conservation to form the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP). The MDWFP is a large state agency charged by state statute to conserve, develop, and protect Mississippi's natural resources and provide continuing outdoor recreation opportunities.\nOrganization and Funding\nThe Agency is organized into six bureaus: Law Enforcement, Freshwater Fisheries, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (MMNS), State Parks, Support Services, and Wildlife. The MDWFP manages state fishing lakes, fish hatcheries, state parks, wildlife management areas (some owned by other entities but managed by MDWFP), three regional offices, and one museum.\nThe MDWFP's annual budget is unlike that of many state agencies: Approximately 90% of our budget is derived from user-generated funds rather than state tax funds. Primary funding sources include hunting and fishing license sales, permit and registration fees, and federal excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment.\nProjects and Achievements\nOver the decades, the MDWFP has:\nAcquired and managed lands, waters, and parks to procure, in perpetuity, public areas for nature-based recreation and to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.\nProvided technical guidance and information to private and public landowners on how to manage their land and water to benefit fish and wildlife.\nEducated the public on the values and importance of Mississippi's natural resources.\nConducted research and population surveys to ensure the sustainability of native species.\nRestored populations of white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, wood ducks, walleye, and striped bass.\nStocked millions of fish in public lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams statewide.\nConstructed boat ramps to access to lakes, rivers, and streams statewide.\nEducated the public on safe and ethical uses of Mississippi's natural resources through hunter and boater education.\nProtected fish and wildlife populations through establishment and enforcement of laws and regulations.\nProvided emergency response to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, and floods.\nAssisted other agencies in ensuring public safety.\nAdministration\nExecutive Director\nLynn Posey, Executive Director\nUnion Church resident Lynn Posey was announced on September 24, 2022 as Tate Reeves' appointee for Executive Director of MDWFP. Posey is a former Mississippi Public Service Commissioner (2008-2016) and Mississippi State Senator (1988-2007).\n“As a life-long outdoorsman, I relish the opportunity to move our state forward and turn the page to the next chapter of wildlife conservation and promoting outdoor recreation in our state,” Posey said. “The men and women of MDWFP do great work protecting and enhancing our lands and waters. I look forward to working with them.”\nDuring his time as a legislator, Posey served for 16 years as chairman of the state Senate Committee on Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, and was instrumental in key legislation geared toward helping the state’s sportsmen. He spent a career serving the public and ensuring natural resources will be available for future generations. He played an important role in creating the Mississippi Sportman’s Caucus, establishing youth hunting seasons, and other legislation.\n“I am extremely proud of the legislation that we passed, such as youth hunting weekends, the statutory protection of our right to hunt, fish, and trap, and scenic stream protection legislation,” said Posey after ending his time as chairman, “and I was especially proud to be a co-founder and chairman of the Mississippi Sportsmen's Caucus.”\nPosey earned his bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a Master’s in Public Administration from Mississippi State University.\nExecutive Staff\nCurtis Thornhill\nDeputy Executive Director\nBrian Ferguson\nChief of Staff\nMore Information\nThe Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks\nAnnual Reports\nMDWFP Career Opportunities\nAccessibility\nMDWFP Social Media Policy\nSupport Us\nOur Mission\nThe mission of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks is to conserve and enhance Mississippi’s wildlife, fisheries, and parks, provide quality outdoor recreation, and engage the public in natural resource conservation.\nHistory\nMississippi's legislative leadership recognized the need for wildlife conservation in our state and founded the Mississippi Game and Fish Commission in 1932.

The MDWFP manages state fishing lakes, fish hatcheries, state parks, wildlife management areas (some owned by other entities but managed by MDWFP), three regional offices, and one museum.\nThe MDWFP's annual budget is unlike that of many state agencies: Approximately 90% of our budget is derived from user-generated funds rather than state tax funds. Primary funding sources include hunting and fishing license sales, permit and registration fees, and federal excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment.\nProjects and Achievements\nOver the decades, the MDWFP has:\nAcquired and managed lands, waters, and parks to procure, in perpetuity, public areas for nature-based recreation and to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.\nProvided technical guidance and information to private and public landowners on how to manage their land and water to benefit fish and wildlife.\nEducated the public on the values and importance of Mississippi's natural resources.\nConducted research and population surveys to ensure the sustainability of native species.\nRestored populations of white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, wood ducks, walleye, and striped bass.\nStocked millions of fish in public lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams statewide.\nConstructed boat ramps to access to lakes, rivers, and streams statewide.\nEducated the public on safe and ethical uses of Mississippi's natural resources through hunter and boater education.\nProtected fish and wildlife populations through establishment and enforcement of laws and regulations.\nProvided emergency response to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, and floods.\nAssisted other agencies in ensuring public safety.\nAdministration\nExecutive Director\nLynn Posey, Executive Director\nUnion Church resident Lynn Posey was announced on September 24, 2022 as Tate Reeves' appointee for Executive Director of MDWFP. Posey is a former Mississippi Public Service Commissioner (2008-2016) and Mississippi State Senator (1988-2007).\n“As a life-long outdoorsman, I relish the opportunity to move our state forward and turn the page to the next chapter of wildlife conservation and promoting outdoor recreation in our state,” Posey said. “The men and women of MDWFP do great work protecting and enhancing our lands and waters. I look forward to working with them.”\nDuring his time as a legislator, Posey served for 16 years as chairman of the state Senate Committee on Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, and was instrumental in key legislation geared toward helping the state’s sportsmen. He spent a career serving the public and ensuring natural resources will be available for future generations. He played an important role in creating the Mississippi Sportman’s Caucus, establishing youth hunting seasons, and other legislation.\n“I am extremely proud of the legislation that we passed, such as youth hunting weekends, the statutory protection of our right to hunt, fish, and trap, and scenic stream protection legislation,” said Posey after ending his time as chairman, “and I was especially proud to be a co-founder and chairman of the Mississippi Sportsmen's Caucus.”\nPosey earned his bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a Master’s in Public Administration from Mississippi State University.\nExecutive Staff\nCurtis Thornhill\nDeputy Executive Director\nBrian Ferguson\nChief of Staff\nMore Information\nThe Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks\nAnnual Reports\nMDWFP Career Opportunities\nAccessibility\nMDWFP Social Media Policy\nSupport Us",
