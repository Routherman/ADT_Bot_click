      "text": "About our course\nPalm Beach Par 3\nCourse History\nPalm Beach Par 3 Golf Course\nDesigned by world-renowned golf course architect Dick Wilson and his apprentice Joe Lee, the Palm Beach Par 3 Golf Course was built by Michael Phipps and opened for play in 1961. It was privately owned until 1973, when the Town of Palm Beach purchased it for $5 million. The course was recently renovated and redesigned in 2009 by Hall of Fame golfer Raymond Floyd.\nPalm Beach Par 3 Golf Course Designer Raymond Floyd, accompanied by the quote, ‘My philosophy is to work within the land to create a golf course that looks natural, that flows and fits into the overall landscape.\nThe course has been touted twice by Golf Digest as “The Best Par 3 in the U.S.,” and it was ranked No. 1 by Golf Magazine (second-place award given to the short course at Augusta National). It has also been listed among Golf Range Magazine’s Top 25 Short Courses in America for the two years there has been a poll.\nProfessionals love it, too. In its early days, it was popular with the founders of the LPGA. Contemporary LPGA members liked it so much they chose the Par 3 as the location for the annual LPGA Pro-Am event for 20 pros, from 1983 until 2000.\nAdditionally, it’s been the location of the LPGA Pro-Am 50th Anniversary celebration and tournament. Many PGA Tour members have also enjoyed the Par 3 over the years.\nThe Town is proud of the Par 3’s historical worldwide recognition and elite status as one of the best. Celebrating its 50th birthday, the beautifully restored Par 3 is well on its way to regaining its glory, when it was ranked No. 1 in the country.\nRaymond Floyd\nChampion Raymond Floyd and his award-winning Design Team are responsible for the new Palm Beach Par 3 Golf Course layout and renovation. The following was borrowed from RayFloyd.com, and we urge everyone to visit and learn more about this remarkable man, his achievements and his vision. It’s his personal touch that makes the Par 3 the best golf course in Florida.\nThe personal commitment of Raymond Floyd to his design projects is from start to finish. He is personally involved in every aspect of the design and construction process, and places a high priority on the architect – client relationship. Mr. Floyd likes to work with the land as the project evolves, and that requires a hand-on approach in the design and construction phases.\nThroughout his playing career, Raymond Floyd has studied the great golf courses of the world. His extensive travels, masterful shot-making and superior strategic skills provide Raymond with a vast and voluminous knowledge of the qualities that make great golf courses. Raymond draws on these experiences to create golf courses with all the benefits of modern golf course architecture but with a focus on traditional philosophies.\nThe result of this design philosophy, are golf courses that appeal to all who play them. Whether one prefers older, more traditional golf courses or newer, more innovative designs, a Raymond Floyd designed golf course uses elements of both philosophies in crafting truly unique and original designs. Further, Raymond believes that the ultimate goal is not just to create quality golf courses, but also to create value for the client. Raymond’s image is one of integrity, intensity and excellence.\nMany Thanks to the Par 3 Foundation\nRenovation of the Palm Beach Par 3 Golf Course and clubhouse would not have been successful if not for the dedication and hard work of the members of the Par 3 Foundation. The foundation continues to promote Raymond Floyd’s dedication to junior golf programs and growing the game.\nPar 3 Foundation Members: James Clark, Howard Cox, Jackie Desmarais, Marjorie Fisher, Maria Floyd (in Memorium), Raymond Floyd, Gerry Goldsmith, Stephen Hall, Ira Harris, Michele Kessler, Terry Allen Kramer, Karin Luter, Daniel McDonnell, Danielle Hickox Moore, Pauline Pitt, Thomas Quick, Robert Simses, Lesly Smith, Scott Snyder, Floyd Wideman\n“The Best Par-3 in the U.S.!” – Golf Digest Magazine\nThe Palm Beach Par 3 Golf Course is a full-service, 18-hole course sitting on 39 acres of ocean-front and intracoastal property in South Florida.
