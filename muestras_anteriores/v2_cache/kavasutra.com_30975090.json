It has been used traditionally for over 3,000 years for celebration, conflict resolution, and for recreational fun. At\nKavasutra Kava Bar\n, the root of the kava plant is mixed with water and strained out using an ancient, yet effective method. We only use the highest grade of kava root, creating the most desirable and smooth kava In the world. We make the kava every day fresh in-house. Instead of a glass or a drink or kava, you would order a shell of kava—as kava is served in half coconut shells in the South Pacific. Kava is served in liquid form and, in tradition, nobody shells alone.\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nABOUT KAVASUTRA\n/$\n$\nABOUT KAVASUTRA\n/$\n$\n/$\n$\nKavasutra Kava Bar\nis America's finest kava bar serving only the most premium kava.
