We reclaim lumber from barns and old houses and recycle it into new creations. The lumber from these barns and houses are from Florida’s early lumber heydays, so most of it is over 100 years old. Primarily we make birdhouses and potting benches, but we have made gardening totes and pallet signs. Each item is unique because we build with the materials we have collected not purchased. We feel that we are doing a small part to preserve our rich heritage as native Floridians and to educate others about it as well.\nSee these and More Artists at the Weekly Farmers Market\nLafayette County Farmers Market\nJoin the Facebook Group for Updates\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/173399029957056/\nA weekly market located in the Town Park featuring local farmer’s produce, jams, jellies, canned goods, baked goods and now handcrafted items as well\nFridays 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm (hours and days may change during the summer months)\nCheryl Folsom\nSadie Ruth’s Cookie\n4243 SW CR 534\nMayo, Florida 32066\nPhone: (386) 688-2656\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sadieruthscookiejar/\nHomemade with love, fresh seasonal favorites just like granny made.
