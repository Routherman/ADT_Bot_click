His family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan when he was in middle school. Michael grew up in a bilingual household, so when his new friends heard him speaking French with his mom, they started calling him “Frenchy”…and it stuck.\nShortly after high school, Frenchy and some friends took a vacation to Clearwater Beach, Florida. He loved it so much that he decided to stay and get a job at a local restaurant. Frenchy worked hard learning every job as he progressed from dishwasher to manager. After eight years in the industry, he was ready to make his dream a reality – opening his own restaurant.\nFrenchy’s goal was simple: to have a friendly, laid-back place where people could come to enjoy a cold drink and fresh seafood. So in 1981, Frenchy’s Original Café, the quaint restaurant on a tiny side street, opened its doors to the beach community (see images below). The Café became an instant success, with lines of people stretching out the door on a daily basis. To ensure a constant source of fresh fish to the Café, Frenchy purchased a fleet of fishing boats and eventually opened Frenchy’s Seafood Company. With these resources in place, Frenchy’s became “famous” for its fresh Super Grouper sandwich, spawning the opening of four more restaurants: Frenchy’s Saltwater Café in 1989, Frenchy’s Rockaway Grill in 1991, Frenchy’s South Beach Cafe in 2003, and Frenchy’s Outpost Bar & Grill in 2013. Four decades running, the Frenchy’s restaurants are still regarded as a staple for delicious, fresh-from-the-Gulf seafood at reasonable prices in a fun and casual beach atmosphere.\nIn 2010, Frenchy continued building his mini empire on Clearwater Beach with the purchase of the former Olympia Motel, located on East Shore Drive. After months of extensive renovations, Frenchy’s Oasis Motel opened, boasting a 15 unit waterfront property, classically designed in retro 60’s, offering fantastic modern accommodations.\ncell_inner\ncell\nport\nAbout Frenchy's Restaurants\nThere’s no place we’d rather be than on Clearwater Beach, serving up our famous super grouper sandwich and other fresh-from-the-Gulf seafood at our 5 slightly different but equally awesome restaurants. Thanks for checking us out online. We look forward to seeing you beachside!\nMore Stuff Here!\n• Web Content Accessibility\n• Terms of Use + Privacy\n• Shipping + Return Policy\n• Employment Opportunities\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• In the Community\n• Check Gift Card Balance\nJoin the fun on Facebook\nCopyright Frenchy’s Corporate 2025 – All rights reserved –\nWeb Accessibility\ncell_inner\ncell\nport",
