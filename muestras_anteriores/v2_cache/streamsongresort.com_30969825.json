Thick forests and grassy plains provided refuge for shovel-tusked mastodons, hornless rhinos, humpless camels and 30-foot crocodiles. Warm waters surrounding the area were filled with a rich variety of prehistoric marine life, including the notorious and now extinct giant shark, Megalodon like the one displayed in the Resort’s Lobby.\nGlacial activity caused the oceans to rise and fall again and again over a 50 million year period. At times, Florida was twice its current width. At other times it was less than 100 miles long and 10 miles wide.\nMan’s activities here trace to early Indian tribes living in native villages throughout the region. Hernando DeSoto and his army camped on this property in 1539. Early settlers endured incredible hardships to tame Central Florida’s vast, wild lands for ranching and farming. Their story is chronicled in the award-winning novel, A Land Remembered, which is found in every guest room of\nStreamsong Lodge\n.\nIt’s in our Bones\nIn the late 1800s came the discovery of massive phosphate rock deposits that had formed 10 to 15 million years earlier when the oceans receded and the remains of sea life settled into the deep sediment layers that were left behind. An industry was thus born that would become the economic backbone of Central Florida for more than a century.\nFossils discovered in the phosphate mines of Florida have revealed much about the history of the land. They tell us that many species of mammals came to tropical and sub-tropical Florida forests from other parts of the world to escape the advancing glaciers of the great “Ice Ages.” Thanks to the unique geological characteristics of this phosphate-rich region, most of the fossils are beautifully preserved, with amazing detail and color. To this day, the land surrounding Streamsong is known as the Bone Valley region of Florida.\nStreamsong Today\nThe Mosaic Company, founders of Streamsong, sought ways to further enhance the land it reclaimed after mining and to support the communities where it operated.  In 2012 Mosaic embarked on an innovative development opportunity called Streamsong as a prototype for post‐mining economic and environmental sustainability. Moving from one land use to another, Streamsong showcases how reclaimed land can be commercially developed in an environmentally responsible manner, while also becoming an economic driver for rural areas.\nSince opening experienced biologists, botanists, environmental engineers and committed hospitality professionals have done more than just reclaim this formally mined land; they have improved it. A bold vision that started just over a decade ago now helps support the local economy creating over 450 hospitality-related jobs, and protecting the land, water and wildlife – all paramount to the resort’s ongoing operation, now owned and operated by KemperSports. Streamsong is a place where individuals and organizations can accomplish things of value and return renewed.\nThe transformation of this unique landscape gave rise to a\none-of-a-kind golf destination\nnow known around the world as a place so aptly named – Streamsong. No highways, no houses or condos, no obstructed sunrises or sunsets. Just the sights and sounds, the flora and fauna, the water and wind of natural Florida.\n</div>\nLOCATION\nFinding your way to Streamsong® is easier and closer than you think.

We think it's going to be a great amenity and people will enjoy it too.\n- Ben Crenshaw, Course Architect, The Chain and Streamsong Red\nStreamsong’s fourth course, The Chain, is now open for play on all 19 holes. Be sure to experience The Chain when you book your upcoming trip to Streamsong\nView The Chain Flyover\nView The Chain Scorecard\nThe Chain is designed to dial up the fun factor for Streamsong guests, with match play and walking at the heart of the experience.  Each hole has teeing areas (instead of tee markers) with dragline chains (the course namesake) in the ground to mark the beginning and end of each teeing area.  Guests choose where they’d like to play each hole in a match play format with the winner of each hole choosing the tee location on the following hole.  The scorecard has no reference to par although most of the holes are one shot holes with a range of yardages from 109 – 293 from the farthest teeing area.  The course includes a six hole loop that plays around a grove of Oaks with holes that vary in length from 110 – 153 yards from the farthest teeing areas or as short as 50 – 88 yards from the most forward teeing area.  From the six hole loop, guests venture into the 13 hole loop where holes measure up to 293 yards with more forced carries in play depending on the tee you choose.\nThe team from Coore and Crenshaw Design have created another masterpiece on the roughly 36 acre site taking advantage of every opportunity to showcase the unexpected elevation changes and live oak groves, water features, and sandscapes throughout to create a compelling layout. The legendary duo also designed\nStreamsong Red\n, which opened in 2012 with “Best New U.S. Course” honors and is perennially ranked among the top 30 courses in the U.S. by Golf Digest, Golf Magazine and Golfweek.\nThe Bucket\n, a two and a half acre putting course that is part of the new concept also steps from the Lodge entrance, is open for resort guest play daily at noon.\nTee times for 19 holes only; 6 and 13 hole loops are on a walk up basis.\nLarge dragline chain links similar to those used in the mining process on the Streamsong site mark the beginning and end of each tee box, however specified tee markers and a score relative to par are thoughtfully and purposefully absent from the concept. Marking the middle of the site (and The Bucket putting course) is a 22,000 pound dragline bucket as a constant reminder of the history of its location.\nThe Chain Hole in One Hall of Fame\nGolf.com\n–\nWhy you won’t want to miss Streamsong’s new 19-hole short course\n<div class=\"page_copy_nav_box\">\nMENU\nGolf\nStreamsong Blue\nStreamsong Red\nStreamsong Black\nThe Chain\nOur Clubhouses\nGolf Fees\nPublic Golf\nMaintenance\nBuddy Golf\nCaddie Services\nGauntlet Putting Course\nPractice Facilities\nWalking Golf Philosophy\n</div>\n“Although diminutive in size, we believe The Chain, when combined with the anything-but-diminutive Bucket putting course, has the potential to complement, perhaps even enhance, Streamsong's reputation for must-be-experienced golf .”\n- Bill Coore, Course Architect, The Chain and Streamsong Red\n\"There are all sorts of holes that are very unusual of shorter length, and the really good players will really enjoy it and say this is not like a pitch and putt, there's some real golf there. We think it's going to be a great amenity and people will enjoy it too.\n- Ben Crenshaw, Course Architect, The Chain and Streamsong Red\nStreamsong’s fourth course, The Chain, is now open for play on all 19 holes.
