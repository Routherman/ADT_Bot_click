Jan was a full-time mortgage broker in Texas, while Mark was a construction manager for Centex Homes in Denver before becoming the National Director of Safety in Dallas. In 2008, they were both starting from scratch after the economic crisis, so they sold everything and moved to Florida with their pets, including TAZ the\nCoati Mundi\n, who became their mascot and logo for Harry's Grill. After two years living in the Florida countryside, they found their way to Anna Maria, where they were only three blocks away from Harry's Grill, which was up for sale 10 months later. Taking a leap of faith they and following the Lord they jumped in head first into the restaurant business. After almost a decade, Jan and Mark have continued to improve the restaurant's ambience, service, and menu choices.\nWhat’s the story behind ‘Harry’s?’\nThe building that now houses Harry's Grill has been home to various local businesses over the years, including a barber shop, florist, video store, real estate office, and ice cream shop. In 2008, it was turned into a bar called Feeling Swell before being sold in 2013. The new owners renamed it Harry's but quickly realized they were not cut out for the restaurant business and sold it to Mark and Jan, who have owned and operated Harry's Grill since November 2014.
