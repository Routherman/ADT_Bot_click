      "text": "Boards and Commissions\nBoards and commissions play a vital role in the governance of the City of Tampa, ensuring public participation, oversight, and informed decision-making across various policy areas. These entities are established to advise on specialized topics such as historic preservation, budget and finance, law enforcement oversight, and code enforcement. Depending on their focus, boards and commissions may be managed by individual city departments—like the Architectural Review Commission under Development & Growth Management—or by the Office of the City Clerk, which oversees administrative and quasi-judicial boards such as the Civil Service Board and Code Enforcement Board. Through their work, these boards help shape city policies, resolve disputes, and enhance government transparency and accountability.\nTop Links\n¶\nAgendas\nApplications for Appointment\nCTTV Live\nCalendar\nBoard Information\nActive Board Members\nSoon to Expire Terms\nOpen Positions\nApply for an Initial Board Position or Reappointment Using Online Form\nExplore Boards and Commissions\n¶\nHousing and Community Development\nAffordable Housing Advisory Committee\nThe Affordable Housing Advisory Committee (AHAC) shall serve as the advisory review board to periodically evaluate established policies, procedures, ordinances, land development regulations, and the local government comprehensive plan, and reports its finding to the Mayor and City Council with recommended changes.\nAffordable Housing Advisory Committee\nArchitectural Review & Historic Preservation\nArchitectural Review Commission\nThe Historic Preservation Commission's mission is to recommend designations, conservation districts, and historic districts.  The HPC is eager to access Tampa's historic resources and has incorporated into its work plan the goal to systematically survey and hopefully, protect previously unsurveyed areas of the city.\nArchitectural Review Commission\nArchitectural Review & Historic Preservation\nBarrio Latino Commission\nThe Barrio Latino Commission has the responsibility of preserving the historic fabric of the District and maintaining its architectural integrity.  The Ybor City Historic District has many character-defining features: pedestrian scale, mixed-use main streets, as well as its unique structures such as the Social Clubs and Cigar Factory buildings.

This partnership has created a year-round program for any child that has a desire to play\nBasketball\n,\nRowing\n, and\nSoftball\n.\nBasketball\nOur basketball program is designed for boys and girls ages 5 through 17 years old. The team curriculum offers weekly training, summer camps, recreational leagues, and competitive tournaments.\nWhen and Where We Play:\nwe have eight basketball gyms located throughout the City of Tampa where we conduct clinics, leagues, tournaments, and camps.\nCompetitive Leagues:\noffer players of any skill level the opportunity to put their basketball skills to work. The leagues operate from December through February and July through August. These leagues develop athletes' confidence and teach the importance of teamwork.\nTravel Teams:\nwe offer highly competitive travel teams that participate in\nAAU\n,\nUSSSA\n, and\nYBOA\nsanctioned games. Our travel teams typically consist of players developed through the Team Tampa Basketball training programs. There is an additional cost to participate in the travel teams' tournaments and scrimmages.\nTryouts:\nall tryout participants have to pre-register online at\nTeam Tampa Sports\nbefore they will be allowed to tryout. For more information about the basketball program, please\nemail us\n.\nRowing\nOpen to all Middle and High School students who want to try a new sport, get a great workout, and have fun on the water! We offer the\nfirst week of practice free\nso that participants can try rowing without a long term commitment.\nWhen and Where We Play:\nour season runs from August through April. We operate out of the Tampa River Center Boathouse located at\nJulian B Lane Riverfront Park\n. Our practice schedule is flexible so athletes can still participate in other clubs and activities.\nConsider joining our\nTeam Tampa Rowing\nfamily. For more information about the rowing program, please\nemail us\n.\nSoftball\nOur softball program will help young girls not only develop their athletic abilities but also great life skills useful on and off the field of play. The program includes experienced coaches and volunteers, a strong sense of sportsmanship, and the expectation that all players will have fun. We offer tournaments, conditioning, summer camps, small group instruction, and coaching support.\nWhen and Where We Play:\noperates out of the two softball complexes located at\nDick Greco Softball Complex\nand the\nNew Tampa Community Park\n.\nDuring the summer months, we offer summer camps staffed with coaches from area high schools and colleges, and college athletes.
