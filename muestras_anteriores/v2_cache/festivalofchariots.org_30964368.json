Every year three 45-foot tall carts are lovingly crafted and prepared for the celebration. Their Lordships Jagannath, Baladeva and Subhadra are paraded on grand chariots through the streets to bestow divine blessings upon everyone.\nThree Rathayatra carts with worshippers massed in the courtyard outside the Jagannath Temple in Jagannath, Puri, Orissa, India\nHis Divine Grace A.C.
