      "text": "The world famous Freedom Factory located in Bradenton, Florida is owned by well known YouTuber and car enthusiast Cleetus McFarland. The track was constructed in the early 1970’s as Desoto Speedway. The 3/8 mile asphalt oval, with 12 degree banking through the turns, quickly became known as the fastest 3/8 mile speedway in the south. Being one of the most popular race tracks in the state, it has seen many NASCAR and circle track icons compete here. After many decades of success, the track unfortunately closed down.\nTurning a Vision into Reality\nAbandoned for several years, and with Mother Nature beginning to take her toll on the facility, Cleetus McFarland decided he would purchase the property and take on the monumental task of bringing back to life the once thriving race track.\n​\nWhile renovations began, several PPV events such as the Freedom 500 and LeMullets were held before the track was ready to accommodate spectators. These two annual races have become a staple of the Freedom Factory and have seen drivers from all over the automotive industry participating in them. After a year of extensive renovations to the facility’s infrastructure, the Freedom Factory held its first public event in February of 2021.\nSince its transformation, the track has once again become a hub for car enthusiasts. Various events are held throughout the year like burnout competitions, drift events, circle track races, truck tugs, and more. Facility improvements are constant and new events are always being created, making it a top destination for motorsport fans. A second life has been given to a well loved track enriched with racing history and we are very proud to share it with everyone. We hope to see you all at an event.\nThe world famous Freedom Factory located in Bradenton, Florida is owned by well known YouTuber and car enthusiast Cleetus McFarland.
