The front nine offers a secluded escape, surrounded by moss-covered oaks and gently rolling fairways, devoid of any residential distractions.\nTransitioning to the back nine, water hazards come into play, challenging golfers with demanding tee shots that demand both distance and precision. Prepare to bring your best game, as each hole has been meticulously crafted to test players of all skill levels. Despite its modest length of 6,500 yards from the tips, the narrow fairways create an illusion of greater length.\nThe Wentworth golf experience is enhanced by the elegant English Manor Clubhouse, evoking the ambiance of an upscale private facility. It’s worth noting that Wentworth is open to the public and warmly welcomes golfers of all levels.\nBook Online\nThe Course Tour\nAs someone said, “It’s one of the longest short courses you’ll ever play.” Once you play the course you’ll know what they were talking about.\nThe front nine winds through a typical Florida woodlands with nary a home to be seen. You’ll find Number 2 especially challenging, but the rest of the front side will test all aspects of your game, with both short and long par 3’s and par 4’s. And there’s plenty of water and sand to keep you honest and staying in the short grass.\nThe back side is just as challenging with one of the most challenging par 3’s you’ll find anywhere in Hole 14. Again a mixture of short and long, and easy and difficult make your round interesting.\nAnd don’t think that once you get on the green the hard work is over. Every green is undulating and challenging. The greens average between 10 and 11 on the stimpmeter, so you better be able to roll your rock if you want to make your par.\nPractice Facilities\nExperience golf improvement at its finest at Wentworth Golf Club’s exceptional practice facility in Tarpon Springs. Our meticulously designed practice area offers an array of amenities tailored to elevate your game.\nTake your swings to new heights on our expansive driving range, where you can fine-tune your long shots, working on distance and accuracy. Aspiring putters can perfect their touch on our spacious practice putting green, while those looking to master the art of the short game will find our dedicated short game area, complete with a challenging sand bunker, indispensable for honing their skills.\nWhether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting your golf journey, our practice facility welcomes golfers of all levels to enhance their abilities and gain the confidence they need to conquer the course.\nBook Online\nThe Pro Shop\nWe've got what you need to hit the course!\nStop by and grab the latest in golf gear or just pick up some golf balls and tees before your next round of golf! Our pro shop is always freshly stocked with what you need to hit the course running!\nGolf Balls\nApparel\nAccessories\nGolf Shoes\nRental Clubs\nGolf Hats\nGolf Balls\nApparel\nAccessories\nGolf Shoes\nRental Clubs\nGolf Hats\nScorecard\nOUR LOWEST PRICES ARE ALWAYS ON\nOUR WEBSITE\nBOOK ONLINE TODAY\nCopyright © 2025 Wentworth Golf Club\nWebsite by\nGolfBack",
