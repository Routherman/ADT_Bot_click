Don, Lonnie, Jim and Charlie Hunt got their start on a long journey in the food business at a young age working for their father at Austin’s Drive-In. In 1991, the brothers combined each of their decades of experience and knowledge in the pizza and convenience store industries, founding the company now known as Hunt Brothers Pizza.  Today, the company remains family owned with the next generation of the Hunt family ensuring the brothers’ core mission of being a blessing remains the same.\nRow Backgrounds\nOur Guiding\nPrinciples\nPlace God first in all we do,\nBe a blessing to people,\nTrust God to meet our needs,\nStrive for excellence.\nRow Backgrounds\nRow Backgrounds\nWe Love Pizza.\nHunt Brothers Pizza represents a legacy of pizza in the convenience store industry. Each and every day, our team of pizza professionals come together to support our store partners in providing the best pizza in their town. We stay committed to offering top quality ingredients and exceptional flavor that far exceed your expectations. We are able to offer the best pizza value in town at over 10,000 locations across 33 states – ensuring you’re never far from one of our store partners, whether at home or on the road.\nOur end goal is always to be a blessing to our store partners and team members, and to support them in doing the same for the customers and communities they serve.\nOur\nJourney\nA real family – with real family values.\nA real family – with real family values. This is how four brothers from Indiana came together to build America’s #1 convenience store pizza brand. It’s an inspirational journey that proves the American dream is alive and well for those who work hard, stick together, have faith, and support each other. At Hunt Brothers Pizza, we’re proud of where we come from. We invite you to take a tour of our company timeline.\nToday\n2004\n1995\n1991\n1981\n1962\nToday, with 50 years of pizza experience, Hunt Brothers® Pizza still serves restaurant quality pizza in over 7,800 convenience stores in 28 states.\nIn 2004, the company name changes to Hunt Brothers® Pizza with new branding to emphasize the family values behind the company. New support offices and distribution warehouses are opened in Nashville, Tennessee and Paris, Kentucky. In the last 13 years, the company has grown and now serves pizza in over 5,600 locations. Hunt Brothers Pizza adds Thin Crust Pizza and Chicken Wings to the menu.\nBuffet Style Pizza is born from the unique concept of All Toppings, No Extra Charge®. The new business model sees great success as partnerships and neighborhood territories are built with c-stores. The faster cooking Lincoln Conveyor Oven and new products like Breakfast Pizza are introduced.\nIn 1991, the brothers reunited with a goal of helping underserved rural convenience stores be successful. They developed a restaurant quality pizza with self-rising dough that fits perfectly into a c-store operation. Built under the mission of helping others be successful and putting God first, the brothers began Pizza House Pizza.\nIn the 1980s the brothers venture apart to found their separate companies, emulating the success of Pepe’s Pizza.\nThe four Hunt brothers—Lonnie, Jim, Charlie and Don—grew up running their father’s restaurant, Austin’s Drive-In in Evansville, Indiana. In 1962, Don Hunt uses his restaurant experience and begins selling pizza crusts and toppings out of his Rambler station wagon. Eventually, the other brothers join him at the company called Pepe’s Pizza.\n[icon_timeline timeline_line_color=”#d1d1d1″ time_sep_color=”#ffffff” time_sep_bg_color=”#dd3333″][icon_timeline_sep time_sep_title=”TODAY”][icon_timeline_item]\nToday, with 50 years of pizza experience, Hunt Brothers® Pizza still serves restaurant quality pizza in over 7,800 convenience stores in 28 states.\n[/icon_timeline_item][icon_timeline_sep time_sep_title=”2004″][icon_timeline_item]\nIn 2004, the company name changes to Hunt Brothers® Pizza with new branding to emphasize the family values behind the company.
