A big thanks to our wonderful team and our guests. We couldn’t have done it without you! Thank you Holmes County Chamber of Commerce!\nA Little Piece of Country with all the Benefits of Town\nWe reckon that our town is the closest Florida has to an Australian outback village.  We treasure the laid back atmosphere among the trees, friendly southern folk, far away from the traffic and the pressures of city life.\nAlthough we are in a country environment we are, in fact, within the Bonifay city limits.\n​\nSo if you don't wish to cook after a day on the road there are lots of options nearby.\n​\nIf breakfast is on your menu take a stroll to the Waffle house for coffee and their great brekky menu. Try the famous Castaway Seafood & Oyster Bar for some great treats from the sea, served with a large dose of southern hospitality. Also nearby are two excellent Mexican restaurants including the Cancun Mexican Grill.\nIf fast food is your thing you will be spoiled for choice between Hardee's, Pizza Hut, Burger King, MacDonalds, Hungry Howie's and Subway. For your grocery needs we have a Piggly Wiggly and Grocery Outlet (try their steaks!) just up the road.\nM&W Smokehouse Barbecue\nWe are pleased to announce that the M & W Barbeque restaurant has opened. This is so close to our park we suggested they call it \"Outback Restaurant\" but apparently the name was already taken!\nSeriously though, Garrett and his team have operated a legendary smoke-house restaurant in town for a number of years. They specialize in great Southern meals including ribs, pulled pork, smoked chicken and the list goes on. With their move closer to I-10 their secret will be out!\nTheir hours are Tuesday - Friday 10.30 AM to 9 PM. No alcohol is served, so have one before y'all go! No need to unhook the car - we have a gate down by our dog park.\nBOOK NOW\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nKeep up with the happenings around Outback Springs RV Resort\nby subscribing to\nthe Occasional Newsletter from Pete and Julie!\nEnter your email address\nSubscribe\nThanks for subscribing!\nLike Us and Share On Facebook!\nOutback Springs RV Park\nCheck out our page on the\nVISIT FLORIDA\nwebsite!\n​\nOur July 4th Holiday Highlights\nWe always have a good time during our holiday sizzles (cookouts).
