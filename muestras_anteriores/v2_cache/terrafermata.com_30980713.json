But encompassing the sense of place and purpose long associated with Sublime's music, Badfish, a Tribute to Sublime continues to channel the spirit of Sublime with a fury not felt for some time. What separates Badfish from other tribute bands is that they have replicated Sublime's essence, developing a scene and dedicated following most commonly reserved for label-\ndriven, mainstream acts. Badfish make their mark on the audience by playing with the spirit of Sublime. They perform not as Sublime would have, or did, but as Badfish does!\nJOE SAMBA\nGuitar slung low, microphone turned up, and emotion overflowing, Joe Samba taps into rock 'n' roll spirit and reggae soul all at once. The Massachusetts-born singer, songwriter, and guitarist sonically teeters on an axis of island-inflected grooves and gritty guitar-craft balanced by his dynamic vocals. He finds the sweet spot between smoked-out Caribbean bliss and sweat-soaked punkified energy. It's why he's quietly emerged as a phenomenon, toppling charts at #1 and performing alongside everyone from The Dirty Heads to Pepper.\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.

By the time he’d reached his late teens, he’d moved to Los Angeles and quickly landed his dream job: serving as frontman for a revived iteration of iconic ska-punk act Sublime, his all-time favorite band. Since co-founding Sublime with Rome in 2009, Ramirez has released three albums with the trio and toured with the likes of Cypress Hill and Incubus, all while continuing to craft his own deeply confessional songs. For the latest turn in a career that’s also included lending his songwriting talents to tracks from superstars like Selena Gomez and Enrique Iglesias, the Nashville-based artist is now gearing up to make his solo debut with a body of work spotlighting his soul-soothing voice and straight-from-the-heart storytelling like never before. As he gears up to share his solo work with the world, Ramirez hopes that his songs might leave listeners with the same joy and solace he finds in creating music. “Especially during lockdown, the feeling of connection I got from playing songs for people on livestreams gave me a whole new sense of purpose,” he says. “With the music I’m putting out now, one of the main goals is to build a community of people who want to lift each other up and really celebrate the moment. Life’s been so good to me, so now I want to pay it forward and bring that energy to everybody else.\nEVENING ELEPHANTS\nDelivering irresistible pop hooks with the intensity of a punk band, Evening Elephants cements the creative union of North Carolina-born vocalist and songwriter Sam Boggs and Southern California native and hip-hop producer and drummer Brandon “B” Leslie. In the midst of their own individual music careers, their respective paths first crossed at an illegal Los Angeles backyard party in 2021. They plotted a jam session within weeks of meeting, adopted the name Evening Elephants (inspired by Naruto), and started throwing showcases in the same backyard they met in. OnesToWatch chronicled one of those first gigs and showed early support. INKED also raved, “With a lust for life and passion for bringing people together, Evening Elephants’ infectious grooves aren’t stopping anytime soon,” while The Luna Collective hailed their “on-brand brutal honesty.” In 2022, Evening Elephants gained momentum with the Evening Demos EP followed by the signature single “Life Is Swell” and the standout “Snow On The Bluff,” produced by PJ Bianco (Imagine Dragons, Jonas Brothers) garnering over 6 million streams. Simultaneously, they built an audience one fan at a time with a fluid and fiery sound, peppering sunny melodies and idiosyncratic instrumentation with the kind of truths typically reserved for diaries. Given the palpable buzz and the level of cult adoration surrounding the band, the Evening Elephants signed to Republic Records and are set to release their debut and much more in 2025.\nBEACH FLY\nBeach Fly is the feel-good musical project led by John DeMari.

What began as the Robby Hunter Band evolved in 2015 with the release of Magic City Hippies, the album that gave the trio its name and solidified a sound both laid-back and relentlessly kinetic. Since then, the band has built a reputation for genre-fluid songwriting and high-energy performances, earning spots at major festivals including Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and Lollapalooza. Their early Hippie Castle EP (2015) introduced their signature mix of poolside melodies and weekend-ready rhythms. Modern Animal (2019) expanded that palette with a deeper, beachside sensibility, while Water Your Garden (2022) served as a psychedelic post-pandemic celebration of connection and self-expression. In 2024, the band returned with a run of stylistically diverse singles, from the disco-funk of “Givin’ Up On Lovin’” (featuring NoMBe) to the acid-house-tinged psych-pop of “I Can’t Let You Go”, culminating in Enemies (2025), a groove-centered breakup album full of emotionally charged, rhythm-driven tracks. Marrying an indie-rock punch with nostalgic, synth-forward textures, Enemies reflects a group willing to evolve without losing the essence of their sound. Though their recordings have drawn both critical and fan acclaim, Magic City Hippies are best known for their live shows: sweaty, exuberant, and effortlessly engaging. Their ability to convert casual listeners into loyal fans is no accident, it’s the result of years of relentless touring, musical chemistry, and an unapologetic commitment to making every show feel like a celebration.\nROHNA\nWith an unmistakable sound and an electrifying stage presence, Rohna has solidified themselves as one of the most exciting bands to emerge from Florida's indie-rock scene. Since forming in 2019, the five-piece—Andres Hernandez (bass and vocals), Austin Burdi (guitar), John Bruno (guitar, keys, and vocals), Luca Canalungo (drums and vocals) and Nick Rovello (guitar and vocals)—have taken their genre-blending mix of Alternative Indie Rock and Psychedelic Punk Rock to stages across the East Coast, captivating audiences with their raw energy and immersive performances. Along the way, they've shared the stage with nationally and internationally recognized acts like The Black Keys, Lovejoy, MisterWives, Last Dinosaurs, Black Pumas, Grouplove, The Aces, Palace, flipturn, The Moss, Good Neighbours, and more. Their rise has seen them light up festival circuits, landing spots at Okeechobee Festival, Playground Festival, Gasparilla Music Festival, 97X Next Big Thing, and Jacksonville's Taco and Tequila Festival. With a dedicated fan base that stretches far beyond their home state, Rohna has built one of the most tightly knit communities in today's indie music scene—one that connects deeply with their emotional lyricism, layered instrumentation, and undeniable chemistry. Since the release of their debut album in 2020, Rohna has continuously evolved, dropping a series of dynamic singles and two genre-defying EPs. Now, they're gearing up for their most ambitious chapter yet—the release of their highly anticipated sophomore album in August 2025. Fueled by a relentless passion for creating and performing, the band is set to embark on a nationwide tour, bringing their high-energy sound to fans across the country. Whether on record or on stage, Rohna isn't just making music—they're making moments that last.\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.

You can see it in his smile. For Iam Tongi, music is not just about fun – although it definitely is that. It’s about transformation.A Hawaiian-born singer-songwriter and the Season 21 champion of American Idol, the 20-year-old Tongi first saw music transform his family, then his sense of purpose … and then every aspect of his life. And now, as he steps forward with the wind firmly at his back, another transformation begins. Marked by growth, gratitude, and feel-good island wisdom, the rising star looks to the horizon. “I know I’m supposed to be doing this, and sometimes that’s all I know,” the inspiring young talent says. “This is what I was meant for.” That clarity came early for the emerging star. First picking up a ukulele in the fifth grade, Tongi grew up in a deeply musical world filled with community gatherings, each one marked by the traditional singing and dance of Pacific Island cultures. Living in the small town of Kahuku on the northern tip of Oahu – far removed from the tourists on the opposite side of the island – he still has vivid memories of his father and grandfather, singing together in quiet harmony as they sat on the family’s front porch. Both hard-working, blue-collar stoics, they rarely even spoke – letting music do the talking instead. “Everyone knew music and music was life – it’s about just having fun,” Tongi explains. “Everyone knew how, except for me. And I remember I always felt kind of left out.” That changed when Tongi began singing, too, looking for a way to get closer to his dad. Although his father’s regular workday was 16 hours long, he’d still rush home to sing with Tongi, teaching his son what he knew and hammering home the idea that music was Tongi’s path to a better life. Clearly blessed with an expressive, charismatic voice, Tongi was pushed hard and immersed in the multi-faceted skills of island reggae – plus a family record collection that featured country (Kenny Rogers), classic rock (Dr. Hook), and\nR&B (Luther Vandross).\nBy 13 Tongi had played his first show, singing Tongan classics and his dad’s favorite Dr. Hook song (“Sylvia’s Mother”) at a North Shore fair. With his fluid style, warm vocal rasp and beaming optimism, Tongi easily cut through the din of the inattentive crowd, earning his first taste of the rush live performance offered. But when the family moved to Seattle, music truly became a lifeline. Dropped into a culture he’d only seen on TV, the tender-hearted Tongi was slow to make friends, and found solace in music instead. Writing songs as an outlet and comfort, he also began singing even more – partly because his dad had suffered two strokes and a heart attack, meaning he could no longer work. The pair practiced twice as hard as before, and often livestreamed their duets on Facebook for hundreds of viewers. It was a reminder of home for them both. “I really missed home. And what made me feel like I was home again, was Hawaiian music,” Tongi says. “I never really fit in at school, so I leaned on my music even more. I wrote all the time.” In a devastating blow, Tongi’s father passed away from kidney failure in December 2021 – but not before encouraging his son to keep singing, one last time. Even so, Tongi couldn’t bring himself to do it. Music brought back painful memories, and without his dad, Tongi began to wonder if he had ever loved music at all. The crestfallen teen put his guitar away, and tried to forget. It was his mother who knew better. Secretly signing her son up for American Idol – a dream her late husband had long pushed for – she surprised Tongi with the news just two days before his audition.\nIn one of Idol’s all-time emotional highlights, that moving performance of James Blunt’s “Monsters” immediately went viral, and by the end of Season 21, Tongi had made history as the first Pacific Islander to ever win the show. As he told the world, he did it to honor his father. … But ultimately, the win helped Tongi learn to believe in himself – inspiring millions in the process. The following year presented more challenge. Despite a thriving fanbase that supports millions of global on-demand streams and social media followers, the constant travel of nationwide concert tours and long separation from family led Tongi to wrestle with his new reality, and struggle to speak his creative truth. But a new day dawns. Finding a trusted collaborator and mentor in acclaimed songwriter/producer Johnny Reid, the pair’s instant connection has rekindled Tongi’s creative drive. And after rebuilding the gifted talent’s confidence, dozens of songs have been written for Tongi’s next chapter, each one combining his skill and background in way that is true to himself. “Now, I’m doing what I love,” the rising star says. “I want it to be a fun.”That quest began with “Road to Hana,” a bouncing, windows-down mix of upbeat island reggae and country heart, with a colorful vocal to match. A tribute to Hawaii with a clever romantic twist, Tongi co-wrote the track with Reid and Roy Morgan, and it marks the first taste of a trove of new material. Leaning into Tongi’s cultural heritage and musical roots – but also the man he’s become – breezy beach balladry and sunshine country stand alongside laid-back soul, gospel, and more, as the young artist celebrates the ever-changing magic of music, and life itself. He’s seen the transformation happen (more than once), and through it all, one lesson remains constant: To live each moment for all it’s worth.“I want people to not take things for granted,” Tongi explains. “Don’t wait until you lose someone to look at it like that. Don’t wait until it’s too late, and always stay positive.“It’s actually a really hard thing to do, and this world is already messed up,” he goes on. “What I want people to take from my music is just positivity.”\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.

The duo hit the road immediately on the Vans Warped Tour wearing skinny jeans, and singing about lost weekends in Hollywood, all while bringing the most legendary parties with them wherever they went.Shwayze has since gone on to work with an array of producers and release several independent albums such as Shwayze Summer on his self-funded Feel Good Entertainment Music label. He continues reinventing his sound while staying true to the influences that brought him where he is today.\nTHE QUASI KINGS\nFormed in Columbus, OH in the Spring of 2016, the The Quasi Kings have quickly “cemented [their] place as the sprawling, multi-instrumental next generation of Columbus reggae.” (Columbus Dispatch). The band, led by brothers Zach (vocals, saxophone, percussion) & Benny Coleman (vocals, bass), varies in age, musical backgrounds, and taste, leading to a worldly & distinctive collage. Their premier offering, 2018’s Throwaway Culture EP, features catchy hooks, tight vocal harmonies, and a unique blend of reggae, rock, and hip-hop. Their latest album, Eye of the Storm, takes things a step further with songs like “Booze”, a raucous Sabbath inspired tune, and the dubby, horn driven “Cut It Out”. Their live shows are high energy, captivating and ever-evolving. The Quasi Kings have had the privilege to play with the likes of Stick Figure, Rebelution, Sublime, Steel Pulse, Tropidelic, Badfish, Fortunate Youth, Third World, Israel Vibration, Dark Star Orchestra & more. Visit\nthequasikings.com\nfor tour dates & more info.\nTWIN FIN\nRobbie & Tyler started making music together in 2012 in Hollister, California, and quickly became a musical duo. They went their separate ways after high school, but still remained close and continued to practice their love of music. Years later Robbie got stationed on Oahu, and after hearing the first rough-cut of \"Mai Tais,\" Tyler moved to Oahu too, eager to record “Mai Tais” live. Soon after living together, Robbie and Tyler recorded a demo album in their living room. During a backyard jam session on the North Shore, it became clear that Chase was the perfect addition to Robbie and Tyler’s musical duo. After their second show as a trio, longtime friend Zack jammed out with the guys, and there was no turning back. Twin Fin was born. Since their first show as a four-piece, the band has become a musical sensation in Honolulu, consistently selling out shows, and continuing to record for their first debut album coming this year.\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.

The New Mastersounds have been delighting audiences with their infectious brand of funky soul-jazz since they formed in Leeds, England in 1999. For the first five years of the band's career they were regulars at the Jazz Café in London, before they began to turn heads on the funk scene in the US, where guitarist/producer/bandleader Eddie Roberts now lives. For over a decade they have been a staple act of the late-night scene during New Orleans' annual Jazz Fest. Always happy to hit the studio between tours, this veteran band now boasts a rich recorded catalogue that includes fifteen original studio albums, four live albums, several compilations, and a remix album. Though they have collaborated over the years with such musical luminaries as Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, Corinne Bailey Rae, Art Neville, Bernard Purdie and Lou Donaldson, they are at their best on stage as a tightly-packed quartet - bass, drums, guitar and keyboards - firing off scorching grooves and feeding on the energy of the dancers in the front row.​​​​\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.

After moving to Fort Collins, Colorado, Grieves began to explore the sounds of Punk Rock and Hip Hop. Completely immersed in the art-form, Grieves truly began honing his craft when he moved to seattle at 19. After self-releasing his debut album\nIrreversible\nin 2007, Grieves took that momentum out on the road developing an ever growing fan base from the west coast to the east coast.While in Seattle, Grieves would eventually hook up with a talented producer and multi-instrumentalist by the name of Budo. In 2008 the duo would hook up and create 15 tracks of sample-free, melody-driven, analog warmth titled\n88 Keys & Counting\n. A combination of singing and rapping tethered together by guitar, horn, and keyboard driven instrumentals. Although ultimately an intense album, there are a few breaks with sounds like \"Identity Cards\" (featuring Luckyiam of Living Legends fame) and \"Greedy Bitch\", a catchy break up song that will be stuck in your head for days after hearing it. Mainly a digital release,\n88 Keys & Counting\nwas welcomed with rave reviews of this new refreshing talent.Now residing in New York City, Grieves and Budo are hard at work finishing his 2010 Rhymesayers debut. So while the world has to wait a little longer for this masterpiece, Rhymesayers is proud to present\n88 Keys & Counting\n, an introduction to a dynamic artist that everyone will be talking about soon enough.\nJWADI\nJORDAN DAVID MILLER, KNOWN BY HIS STAGE NAME JWADI, HAS JOURNEYED THROUGH DARKNESS AND EMERGED AS AN INSPIRATIONAL FIGURE IN THE INDIE MUSIC SCENE. BORN AND RAISED IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, JORDAN'S EARLY FORAY INTO MUSIC SAW HIM CO-FOUNDING THE REGGAE-ROCK BAND THE MOVEMENT AROUND THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM. HIS DECADE-LONG GIGGING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE BAND'S FIRST THREE ALBUMS CULMINATED IN COLOSSAL PERSONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATTLES WITH ALCOHOLISM. AFTER LEAVING THE BAND IN 2012, JORDAN FACED A TUMULTUOUS PERIOD MARKED BY AIMLESS YEARS UNTIL HE TOOK A BOLD STEP TOWARDS RECOVERY IN LATE 2022. OCTOBER 2022 MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CHAPTER: A SOBER, CLEARER VISION FOR HIS LIFE AND ART. RESIDING IN A SOBER LIVING FACILITY, JORDAN REKINDLED HIS LOVE FOR MUSIC, LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR HIS SOLO CAREER. EQUIPPED WITH JUST A LAPTOP, GUITAR, AND KEYBOARD, HE PENNED HIS DEBUT SOLO ALBUM, \"ALL THAT GLITTERS,\" WHICH HE RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER 2023 SHORTLY AFTER MOVING TO SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA. THIS NEW ENDEAVOR UNDER THE BANNER OF JWADI HAS BEEN BOTH A RENAISSANCE AND A REVELATION.JWADI'S DISCOGRAPHY INCLUDES SINGLES LIKE \"BUCKET LIST\" AND \"THE OTHER SIDE,\" WHICH WERE PRECURSORS TO THE INTROSPECTIVE STORYTELLING FOUND IN \"ALL THAT GLITTERS.\" HIS CREATIVITY DOESN'T ADHERE TO TRADITIONAL GENRE BOUNDARIES, OFTEN WEAVING TOGETHER INFLUENCES THAT SPAN FROM EMINEM TO BOB MARLEY, THE CURE TO TOM WAITS, CREATING A TAPESTRY THAT'S UNIQUELY HIS OWN. WITH A FLAIR FOR NARRATING PERSONAL AND POIGNANT TALES, JWADI’S RECENT WORK, \"THE YEAR OF SUBTRACTION,\" RELEASED IN FEBRUARY 2025, FEATURES VARIED TRACKS LIKE THE COUNTRY-TINGED \"A BAG OF BONES AND A BOTTLE OF BOOZE,\" THE HIP-HOP-INFUSED ROCK OF \"THE SEAMSTRESS,\" AND THE REGGAE-LAYERED \"GROUND CONTROL.\" EACH PIECE IS A SHARD OF HIS EVOLVING NARRATIVE, RESONATING WITH AUTHENTICITY AND THE HARD-WON WISDOM OF HIS PERSONAL JOURNEY. AS JWADI CONTINUES TO EXPLORE HIS SOUND AND HONE HIS SKILLS, HIS IMMEDIATE FOCUS ON MIXING AND PRODUCING NOT ONLY HIS MUSIC BUT ALSO NURTURING THE TALENTS OF OTHERS SIGNIFIES HIS COMMITMENT TO THE CRAFT. FOR JWADI, MUSIC ISN'T JUST AN ESCAPE; IT’S A LIFELINE, A FORUM TO EXPRESS VULNERABILITY AND TRIUMPH. HIS STORY ISN'T JUST ABOUT SURVIVING; IT'S ABOUT THRIVING IN NEW MUSICAL VENTURES AND SOLIDIFYING HIS PLACE AS A STORYTELLER IN THE TAPESTRY OF MODERN INDIE MUSIC.\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.

A quarter-century later, elementary school buddies Raul Bianchi, Adam Peterson and Geoff Weers, along with bassist Ryan DeMars, who joined in 2000, have forged a unique original sound born in the laid-back beach life of their Santa Cruz, CA. hometown. The Expendables’ infectious hybrid of ska, surf-rock, punk, reggae and metal can be heard in their latest streaming track, “Surfman Cometh,” a spaghetti-western meets “Pipeline” twang that could easily form the soundtrack to the latest Quentin Tarantino film. The song is the first release from the group’s new and improved Band Room, their longtime rehearsal space in a 1,100 square foot warehouse and former wine cellar on Coral Street, where Adam Patterson took charge of the mix to great effect. “Geoff brought that riff to the table, and the band jammed on it,’ explains Raul about the song’s genesis. “We recorded it live at our studio, then laid down overdubs in our individual homes. Adam and I even went down to Pleasure Point here in town with laptops and microphones to record the crashing waves at the beginning and end.”\nView Map\nHide Map\nfix for IE10 event description images not sizing properly.
