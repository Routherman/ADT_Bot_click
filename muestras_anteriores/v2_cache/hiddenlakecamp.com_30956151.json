      "text": "ABOUT US\nHidden Lake Resort is a nudist campground nestled within 110 acres of nature. Our beautiful lake, the blue moon lagoon, walking trails, and wonderful community are perfect for people who love being one with nature. We have been providing a peaceful and relaxing environment for nudists for 14 years. Our goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone who visits us.\nOUR FACILITIES\nOur 110 acre resort offers a range of facilities for our guests to enjoy. We have a BBQ area on the deck at the clubhouse. There are also tables, chairs and umbrellas for your convenience. The ice house and fish cleaning station are next to the clubhouse along the lakeshore.  The community fire pit is across from the office, behind the clubhouse. Our large, clean, co-ed bathhouse/showerhouse contains 8 toilets, 8 showers, 8 sinks. We have pedal boats, canoes and kayaks on the lakeshore for your use. You may keep what you catch in our lake. We are a pet friendly resort, as long as they are on a leash and you pick up after them. Bicycles, e-bikes, golf carts, go carts, gators, 4-wheelers and any other toys you have are welcome on the trails. The beach at the swimming lagoon has lounge chairs, tables and umbrellas.  There is also a shooting range on property. No fully automatic weapons are allowed. We do encourage you to bring your food and drinks with you, as we do not have a bar or restaurant on site. Our property is BYOB, however, no glass please. You will also want to bring sunscreen and bug spray; and of course, do not forget your towels.\n\"Hidden Lake Resort is the perfect place to unwind and enjoy nature. The peaceful and relaxing environment is just what I needed to recharge my batteries. I can't wait to visit again!\"\n\"I had a wonderful time at Hidden Lake Resort. The facilities were top-notch, and the staff was friendly and helpful.
