I thought this was just another dive bar, I could not be more wrong. Grabbed a cold beer and a steak and cheese and it was incredible.  But listen, I can get good food anywhere, when it comes to the service, that's what put this place over the top. My bartenders Munson, Jen & Brittnee were not only knowledgeable and suggestive, but super nice and conversational.  Looking forward to making this my regular stop.\nR-CONTENT\nJesse's Xtreme Sports Bar\n526 Google reviews\nWrite a review\nAlan Sarikelle\n2025-01-19\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\nR-CONTENT\nNeighborhood bar\nR-CONTENT\nMarc Jeanbaptiste\n2025-01-02\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\nR-CONTENT\nThe food is great and the service is great , I come here with my girlfriend all the time we’re regulars and we love our service.
