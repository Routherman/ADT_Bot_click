      "text": "Welcome to Fawn Ridge, an adult community shaped by the dedication and volunteerism of its owners. Established in 1988, our park has grown from humble beginnings into a cherished getaway for many families.\nOur History\nDeer Creek Phase II U.D.I. P.O.A. Class I, Inc., known as Fawn Ridge, traces its roots back to 1988 when it emerged as an independent entity through the dedication of its original owners. The community’s journey involved separating from Deer Creek management and forming its own entity. Initially, Fawn Ridge operated under the management of Deer Creek Golf & Tennis Resort, Ltd., along with other corporate entities, including Phase I (Mockingbird) to the northwest. Phase II, known as Fawn Ridge, was under construction, with concrete pads and roads being laid. The swimming pool, bathhouse, and tennis courts were set up in their current locations, and four park models were installed between 1988 and 1989.\nFrom its inception, Fawn Ridge has navigated various legal transitions and ownership changes, culminating in its establishment as a distinct community governed by a covenant. Volunteerism has played a pivotal role, from constructing essential facilities like the clubhouse to sustaining day-to-day operations and fostering a vibrant community spirit. Today, Fawn Ridge operates autonomously under the stewardship of an elected board, ensuring its growth and maintenance. As a testament to its spirit of unity and self-sufficiency, Fawn Ridge invites all to join its extended family and contribute to the ongoing legacy of this exceptional camping destination.\nJoin Our Family\nMore than just a campground, Fawn Ridge is a community, a family where everyone’s contribution counts. We invite you to join us and become an active part of our thriving family.\nSchedule a visit to the park and find more information on available deeds on our\nDeed Sales\npage.\nFawn Ridge Rewind: 2009",
