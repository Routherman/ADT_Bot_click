SVG Version: 6.00 Build 0)\nor-logo\nMembership Opportunities\nAdvantages of Membership\nThere are two private club membership opportunities at Ocean Reef Club.\nEquity Membership\nThe purchaser of a property, including a dock, in the Ocean Reef Club or Anglers Club communities must become an Equity Member in order to use the Club’s facilities. Three Equity Members must sponsor a candidate for this category of Club membership and their membership must be approved prior to closing on their property, otherwise the property owner cannot re-apply for Equity membership for five years. Both Equity and non-property-owning Members and their guests are privileged to enjoy all the Club’s amenities—from Buccaneer Island’s swim lagoon and pools to the delightful selection of restaurants and shops. And everyone enjoys the community’s atmosphere of ease, the sense of being among friends in the place where they truly belong.\nFor further information about Ocean Reef Club membership, please contact Membership at\nmembership@oceanreef.com\n, call 305-367-5921 or fill out our\nonline form\n.\nSee information regarding our privacy policy\nhere\n.\nSocial Membership\nSocial membership is on a waitlist and is currently closed to new applications.\nThere are only two ways to experience Ocean Reef Club, as a guest of a Member or through the pages of Living magazine.\nComplete and submit the registration form below for your complimentary copy.\nrequest your copy of living magazine\nWhere are the Members from?\nThere is a heavy contingency of Members from the Mid-West, North-East and Florida. But don’t let that fool you, the Club has a large population from Canada and representation from countries around the world.\nWhat are the fees for membership?\nLike many clubs, there is an initiation fee and annual dues. While the fees vary depending on the type of membership you are considering, the ongoing cost of membership is much lower than most other club communities. In addition to that, for those that are considering Equity ownership we have one of the highest returns on that initiation fee. For specific pricing information and a better understanding of the value in Club Membership, please contact our Membership Office at 305-367-5921 or email the Vice President of Membership Services, Islande Dillon, at idillon@oceanreef.com.\nIs the initiation fee for Social membership transferable or refundable?\nIt is not refundable but it can be applied to an Equity membership if you choose to buy a property within the first five years of your Social membership.\nQUICK LINKS\nRequest Your Copy of Living Magazine\nPhoto Gallery\nLocation\nCareers\nReal Estate\nExecutive Team\nMember Login\nPrivacy Policy\nVendor Code of Conduct\nADA Statement\nMember Payment Portal\nSEARCH\nsearch\nSEARCH\n1-800-741-7333\nCONNECT WITH US\nfacebook\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\nGenerator: Adobe Illustrator 20.0.0, SVG Export Plug-In .

While the fees vary depending on the type of membership you are considering, the ongoing cost of membership is much lower than most other club communities. In addition to that, for those that are considering Equity ownership we have one of the highest returns on that initiation fee. For specific pricing information and a better understanding of the value in Club Membership, please contact our Membership Office at 305-367-5921 or email membership@oceanreef.com.\nMembership Information\nIs the initiation fee for Social membership transferable or refundable?\nIt is not refundable, but for a period of time, a portion of it can be applied to the purchase of an Equity membership.\nMembership Information\nHow many Members are there?\nThere just over 1,700 Equity Member families, who own the Club, their children and grandchildren comprise our Legacy membership and our Social Membership is at full complement, with the waitlist closed.\nMembership Information\nWhat memberships are there?\nEquity – Ocean Reef Club is a Member-owned club and these are the members who have, ownership it the Club itself, voting rights and own an eligible property.\nSocial – A membership with year-round Club access, for a limited number of days.\nLegacy – This membership is reserved for the children and grandchildren of Equity members.\nAbout the Club\nHow long has the Club been in existence?\nThe Ocean Reef Club began as a small fishing camp in 1948 and over the years grew as the Members wanted to spend more time and expand their activities beyond the wide array of fishing options to include golf, tennis, yachting, dining, flying, shopping, swimming and much, much more.\nAbout the Club\nHow big is Ocean Reef?\nThe land the Club occupies is approximately four miles long and a mile wide. This encompasses 2500 acres. However a portion of this land also includes a national wildlife sanctuary so in addition to the planned landscaping throughout the Club there is an abundance of wildlife in the form of majestic and tropical birds including our very own Osprey that has made its home in the middle of one of our two golf courses..\nAbout the Club\nDo any famous people live or belong to the Club?\nOne of the great features of a private club such as Ocean Reef is the privacy. Many of our Members can come with their family and feel that they are home, away from prying eyes and curious onlookers. Someone famous, whether from business or entertainment is just like everyone else here at the Club: a Member.\nAbout the Club\nDo people live there year round?\nYes. With a shopping village and all the conveniences of a big city wrapped in a small town atmosphere we have many Members that have decided to make this their home. The availability of a PreK3-8th grade school in the Club adds to the amenities that make year-round living at Ocean Reef Club a great choice for many of our Equity Members.\nAbout the Club\nDo you have a hotel or inn?\nYes, in addition to property owning Members, we have Members that don’t own property and they will visit the Club for holidays and family getaways, staying in our 144 room Inn or one of our many Vacation Rental properties.\nAbout the Club\nAre you pet friendly?\nWe love pets! Every winter is our “Blessing of the Animals” where the pets are the stars! Depending on where you might be staying there is availability for smaller pets to visit with their owners.

There is also a veterinary office in the Club as well, where they can see to a wide variety of pets.\nAbout the Club\nIs there a beach?\nThere is a beautiful lagoon adjacent to the ocean surrounded by white sandy beach. Along with a variety of water toys for young and old alike. This area is combined with our Beach Grill, Beach Bar and two pools that all comprise what we call Buccaneer Island–a favorite spot for our Members and their children.\nAbout the Club\nIs it safe?\nWe are located on a peninsula with one road leading into the Club. That road has a guard gate that is manned 24 hours a day. Arrival by water means arrival through one of our canals or the main channel which are all monitored electronically as well as observed through security boat patrols. We have onsite security plus the Monroe County Sheriff’s office has an Ocean Reef Substation with five deputies assigned to cover the Club and surrounding area.\nOur community security staff also are firefighter and paramedic certified with an onsite fire station. There is a world class medical center at the Club that provides private medicine, executive wellness programs health assessments and physical therapy. They also have a visiting specialist program for any needs our Members might desire as well as full time physicians on staff.\nSo yes, this is a great place to feel safe, sound and secure.\nGetting There\nHow far is Key West?\nWe are at the very “top” of the Florida Keys on the northern edge of Key Largo.

This is so popular that the Club also provides a rental program for golf carts if you don’t have your own! However should you choose to not rent a golf cart, and if you don’t have a car of your own our Bell staff has a fleet of vehicles that can provide transportation anywhere on Club property upon request.\nGetting There\nIs there transporation available to and from the airport, and can you rent a car there?\nWe have an onsite rental car agency and private limousine company that can provide chauffeur driven transportation anywhere outside of the Club.\nGetting There\nWhat is the dress code?\nThe dress code varies depending on the activity or venue.

Every Vacation Rental residence has an on-premise, dedicated account specialist ensuring the attention to detail and guest experience is never compromised.\nParticipating Equity Members appreciate the seamless billing, as warranted, through their Member account, flexible owner usage, bulk purchasing opportunities, on-site reservations, pre- and post- occupancy inspections, generous Owner Referral commissions and integration into the broad based, global Ocean Reef marketing plan.\nIn-residence Members and Guests enjoy 24/7 support by the Front Desk and Bell Stand, full-service housekeeping, after hours Resident Manager and an on-site engineering team – all staffed by Club Associates.\nYour Club has established brand standards and no other team is more prepared to preserve these standards than your Ocean Reef Vacation Rentals’ team.\nVacation Rental General Questions\nAre there any special benefits or advantages for those participating in the Ocean Reef Vacation Rentals’ program?\nOcean Reef staffs an on-site Manager on Duty (MOD), 365 days a year to handle after hour emergencies as well as Guest and Owner concerns. Ocean Reef has experienced maintenance personnel on call daily and holidays to quickly resolve any concern and to ensure the highest level of Member service.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan I personalize my unit?\nWhile we are happy to make recommendations, we encourage you to make your residence ‘your own’. One of the interesting nuances of the Club’s collection is each residence is individually owned and, as such, offers a unique experience.\nWe do, however, suggest the removal of sentimental décor items prior to opening your residence to a Member/Guest. If you would like to have these types of items when occupying your residence, please feel free to do so. Prior to your departure, simply store them in your owner’s closet for their safety and to avoid mishaps.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan I place restrictions on my rental unit?\nBy default, all Ocean Reef residences are designated as non-smoking residences.\nTo maximize your exposure, we encourage you to designate your residence as “Pet Friendly”. Knowing Ocean Reef is a pet friendly destination should come as no surprise. However, did you know many Ocean Reef Club Members pre-plan and seek pet friendly experiences? According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, a full 67% of American households have a little companion in their home. Certainly not all of these families travel with their pet, but this request is becoming more and more prevalent in the luxury travel markets.\nWere you aware that, unless you have instructed otherwise, your Ocean Reef residence is marketed as ‘No Pets’? If you are nodding your head, then you have automatically eliminated a substantial portion of the potential Member/Guest travelers from enjoying your residence. As demonstrated, pet owners may be willing to pay a little more for the pleasure of toting Rover along with them when they travel. One might also argue that the duration of the stay may be longer as the Member/Guest isn’t so concerned about returning home quickly to bail out their loved one from puppy ‘jail’.\nIndeed, damage to your residence by a pet may be a valid concern. Understanding our number one priority is to protect your asset; we have implemented and adhere to a very strict Pet Policy. To start, any Member/Guest bringing a pet into a Vacation Rentals’ residence is charged a pet fee. This is not a deposit but rather a fee so we may professionally clean the residence upon departure. Next, our Housekeeping Teams are in the residence daily and they are trained to identify any issues within the home. Finally, your property manager will preview the residence immediately upon Rover’s departure to ensure there is no damage inside the home. Naturally, any damage becomes the responsibility of the Member/Guest.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow can we control occupancy in our residence?\nYour Club carefully manages occupancy levels beginning with how we market a residence, to reservations, to check-in and while providing daily services. At any time, should we have a concern, we immediately address this with the Member/Guest.\nORCA allows occupancy up to two per bedroom and two ‘at large’. Thus, a two-bedroom residence would customarily provide occupancy up to six.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan I rent my unit myself while on the Ocean Reef Rental Program?\nDue to the amount of effort and resources that goes into marketing and managing your residence, we ask for an exclusive arrangement.\nOne of the exciting features of our program is the Referral Program. You may refer a fellow Member or Guest to the Club and, when they secure a reservation to enjoy your residence at the prevailing rental rates, you will enjoy a more generous portion of the rental fee.\nVacation Rental General Questions\nWhy Ocean Reef Club Vacation Rentals?\nA partnership with Ocean Reef Vacation Rentals means that you have chosen a quality experience, supported by the depth and breadth of the Club. This is what sets Ocean Reef apart from any other rental management company. We invest in the resources necessary to ensure the finest experiences. Ocean Reef Members and Guests have established service and quality expectations and no other team is prepared to meet and exceed these expectations.\nIn addition, Members and Guests enjoying a Vacation Rentals’ residence receive exclusive benefits, while in residence, which increases the perceived value proposition.\nYour Vacation Rentals’ department is Club owned and managed. Thus, by working with the Club’s rental program, you are enhancing the value of your Club.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan I set my own rates for my unit?\nOcean Reef employs two full-time Revenue professionals who monitor demand and occupancy and establish rates based on these factors and various trends in the luxury travel industry. Rest assured, these Associates understand the travel patterns of your fellow Members, Guests and Group travelers. The success of the effort is driven by offering dynamic rates and, more importantly, Member value.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nShould we make our boat dockage available?\nSome residences certainly provide boat dockage. In some cases, such as a condominium, boat dockage is available, but ‘unassigned’. In short, this simply means the Member/Guest may have the ability to enjoy boat dockage but it is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and is not guaranteed. If boat dockage is desired, we encourage the Member/Guest to contact us for guidance. If the residence they are considering has unassigned boat dockage, we will provide the contact information for the neighborhood association’s dock master.\nFor larger boats, Members/Guests may also work directly with the Ocean Reef Marina.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan I, or my contractors, gain access to my unit if I don’t have a reservation?\nOur policy is never to disturb a Guest or compromise their stay. Thus, we simply ask that you contact our office to ensure the residence is vacant.\nWe recognize the desire to access your residence at various times to inspect it, change décor or retrieve items from your owner’s closet. We also understand the need for outside contractors or vendors to access the residence. To gain access to your Ocean Reef residence, simply call our office and, if vacant, we will provide a loaner key.\nShould your contractors or vendors need a significant amount of time in the residence, please contact us to schedule a maintenance block in order to accommodate the work needed.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow does Housekeeping work?\nWhile a Guest is in residence, we provide daily housekeeping (trash and tidy). The fee for this service is in the Club’s share of the rental revenue. The Guest may, for an additional fee, request full-service housekeeping, if they wish. When the Guest departs, your Housekeeping team provides a ‘departure clean’, which is a full-service effort and readies the residence for the next arrival. As well, the fee for this service is in the Club’s share of the rental fee.\nWhile a residence Owner is in residence, housekeeping services are only provided upon request, and for the appropriate fee. When the Owner departs, your Housekeeping team provides a departure clean and the fee for this service is conveniently billed to the Owner’s Member account.\nWhen an Owner has a non-paying Guest enjoying the residence housekeeping services are only provided upon request, and for the appropriate fee. When the Guest departs, your Housekeeping team provides a departure clean and the fee for this service is conveniently billed to the Owner’s Member account, or to the Guest’s credit card, whichever is indicated on the Guest Sponsorship Form.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow does Ocean Reef decide which units are rented first?\nWhen a Member/Guest is exploring options, your Lodging Reservations’ team will diligently work to fulfill specific requests (i.e.: residence size; location; pet friendly, interior features; view orientation; etc.). Often times, a Member/Guest will request a specific residence. Not surprising, if the Member/Guest previously had a wonderful experience, they will work to replicate this experience – starting with the same residence. The Reservations’ team is well versed with the subtle nuances of each residence including sleeping configurations and bathroom footprints. In some cases, we have the pleasure of personally previewing residences with a Member/Guest. As you can imagine, this truly helps ‘sell’ the residence. Consideration is also given as it relates to the Club’s standards. To ensure we exceed a Member’s/Guest’s expectations, we will first offer the stay in a Premium residence.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow is damage or theft in my unit handled (include damage waiver)?\nOcean Reef has developed a very detailed housekeeping inspection process to protect your assets. After room attendants clean, trained “quality control” supervisors ensure cleaning standards are met and check for any damages.\nOne of the growing business segments in the Vacation Rentals’ industry is Damage Waiver Insurance Policies. In short, the Guest is usually asked to pay a nominal fee, usually between $50 and $75 per reservation, to avoid being charged for lost or broken items while enjoying a residence. These policies historically carry a small deductible and provide a profit to the agency offering the coverage.\nYour Club explored this practice and elected not to implement such a program. This decision was unanimously agreed upon by the Club’s Executive Leadership. Our primary objectives remain the protection of your asset and enhancing the value of your Club.\nHere is how we intend to accomplish this:\nFirst, during the time a Member/Guest is enjoying your residence, the Club will pay for any lost or broken items. You will no longer be charged for the missing fork, broken coffee pot, and so on. Of course, the Member/Guest will remain responsible for any intentional or malicious damage and this service will not include issues considered normal wear and tear.\nSecond, the cost for this service will not be seen in the Member/Guest folio. And, you will not receive a charge for this service in your Member Account Billing.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow much is the Management Fee and what does it include?\nThe Club offers a fair and equitable rental environment for all Members. The standard relationship provides 60% of the rental fee to the residence Owner. There are some variances with this arrangement that can be personally discussed with the Vacation Rentals’ team.\nFrom the Club portion of the rental fee, they facilitate a comprehensive advertising and marketing effort. In addition, the Club employs a professional Lodging Reservations’ team who is fully-trained on how to ‘sell’ the Ocean Reef experience. Beyond these items, the Club offers Members and Guests the depth and breadth of the entire Club (i.e.: Housekeeping; Engineering; 24/7 Front Desk and Bell Stand; Concierge services…just to name a few of the services available).\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat happens if I want to enjoy my residence and there is a Member/Guest reservation in place?\nIn some rare instances, we might be able to relocate the reservation. If we are not able to relocate the reservation, we must honor the Member/Guest reservation.\nUnderstanding we may secure Member/Guest reservations up to 12-months in advance, we encourage you to look forward, even beyond the 12-months’ window, and secure your Owner’s use dates. This will ensure you are able to enjoy your Ocean Reef residence during those special dates.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow often can I use my unit?\nAs far as Ocean Reef is concerned, this is your residence and you should have the pleasure of enjoying it as you wish. The rental agreement does speak to minimum availability to be eligible for the Club’s program. Should these restrictions not match your desired usage, however, simply let us know so we can explore options.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow often do I receive rental checks?\nThe Club operates on a calendar month fiscal period. At the end of each month, your Member Accounting team performs their audit, closes the month and rental checks and statements are disbursed usually the second week of the following month (i.e.: rentals during January are paid around the second week of February).\nYour statements will include each nightly rental revenue, the Engineering fee, any Housekeeping charges and any adjustment (i.e.: mechanical/appliance repairs, etc.).\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow much rental revenue can I expect?\nAs you can imagine, we have the rental history for most neighborhoods and residence types. While we cannot guarantee rental revenues, we can provide historical data, which will give you an estimate of what you may expect. Rental revenues are always determined by economic factors beyond our control. In addition, how a residence Owner uses their residence (personal use and Guest use) will certainly impact their rental revenues.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow will my residence compare to the other residences in the program?\nOcean Reef has established Standards, which help set expectations for Members and Guests. We use the terms ‘Premium’ and ‘Deluxe’. While some of the parameters are subjective, the guidelines are very precise and fair. Your residence will be evaluated based on these Standards.\nAll residences will be treated and rented using the same parameters that apply to comparable residence types in our existing collection. Your residence will “compete” equally for Member and Guest rentals with like rated residences in our active inventory.\nFor a complete explanation of the Standards, please give us a call.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow will the rental activity compare to activity experienced outside the Club’s program?\nKeeping in mind your Vacation Rentals’ department is Club owned and managed, it is safe to presume the majority of the Club’s rental activity will originate through your Lodging Reservations’ team. In addition, there are significant advantages for those Members working through their Club. First, the Member will enjoy a 10% discount, while in residence, on all Club managed food, beverage and retail outlets. Next, these members enjoy daily Housekeeping services, 24/7 Front Desk services and the full support of the Club’s Engineering team.\nWhile the other agencies do a fine job, none can provide the rental activity and support as realized with the Club’s program.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nIf I need to take my residence out of the rental pool for renovations, what should I do?\nWe congratulate you on your desire to make enhancements within your residence. So we may work around any pending reservations, please call us in advance of scheduling your work. Your Vacation Rentals’ team will then work with you and your contractors to provide keys to access your residence. When your enhancements are complete, we will coordinate any cleaning that may be required.  We will also schedule an updated professional photo shoot, if necessary.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat costs will I be responsible for as an Owner?\nEquity Members participating in the Club rental program will be responsible for normal wear and tear, furniture and appliance replacement, housekeeping fees for Owner’s stays (i.e.: departure clean), the annual Housekeeping Deep Clean service, the annual Engineering fee, non-routine maintenance, and interior upgrades including painting and upholstery cleaning.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat insurance, beyond what my association carries, do I need to participate in the rental program?\nPlease review your policy with your insurance provider to ensure you are comfortable with your coverage.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat rates will be charged to rent my unit?\nOur proposed rate structure is determined annually each year. In order to achieve the highest occupancy percentages, average daily rates, and to secure the best overall rentals, a variety of pricing options are available to Members/Guests. Your Club employs two full-time Revenue Managers that monitors occupancy and demand. In addition, they watch trends in the luxury travel industry to ensure they anticipate needs and expectations. Ocean Reef will use its best pricing judgment in an effort to secure consistent levels of occupancy.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWho is my contact when I need assistance with issues relating to my unit?\nWhile you are certainly free to call on any of your Vacation Rentals’ team, we will designate an Associate to be your Member liaison. This Associate will become intimately familiar with your residence including the subtle nuances that make it special. This Associate will keep you informed of concerns related to your residence and will be responsible for managing your asset with the upmost care and diligence.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow can I access my unit?\nEnsuring security and privacy for our Members and Guests is paramount. If you wish to access your residence, please first contact the Vacation Rentals’ office to ensure the residence is vacant. Please keep in mind we often secure a last minute reservation. As a result, even if your residence did not have a reservation in place a few days ago, there may be a Member/Guest enjoying your residence today.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan a Member/Guest request an early check-in or late departure?\nBy definition, check-in is after 4pm and check-out is before 11am. In the event a Member/Guest is requesting an early check-in or late check-out, defined as (check-in between 11am and 4pm; check-out between 11am and 6pm), the Member/Guest will be charged 50% of the daily rate for this convenience. In the event there is an arrival on the scheduled date of departure, the late departure request will be respectfully denied. And, should there be a Member/Guest departing that conflicts with the early check-in request, it is likely the request will be respectfully denied.\nOften times, a Member/Guest asks for access to a residence in advance of check-in so they may place some of their perishables in the fridge. While every effort is made to accommodate these requests, we must provide the Club’s teams (i.e.: Housekeeping, Vacation Rentals and Engineering) to facilitate their tasks before we are able to allow access to the residence. As a courtesy, the Bell Stand and Front Desk will assist in storing the perishables prior to check-in.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nCan a Member/Guest enjoy access to the golf cart bay, garage or Owner’s golf cart?\nThe short answer is likely no. The golf cart bay and garages are usually reserved for the Owner’s personal use only. Should a Member/Guest wish to enjoy a golf cart during their stay, we would introduce them to the Club’s Golf Cart Rental team for assistance.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWould it be of value if we included our personal golf cart with our residence?\nWe suggest you keep your personal golf cart locked in a safe place while you are not in residence. Should a Member or Guest wish to enjoy a golf cart, while here at Ocean Reef, we will introduce them to the Club’s Golf Cart Rental department.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nShould we provide the ability for the Member or Guest to charge their golf cart?\nThis is a commonly asked question and we believe offering cart charging is a thoughtful feature. We recognize this is not always possible. Thus, if the Member or Guest is renting a golf cart from the Club, they are free to return the golf cart as often as they wish and exchange it for a fully charged golf cart. For the convenience of the Member or Guest, the Cart Rental team is also more than pleased to bring the fully charged golf cart to the residence they are enjoying and handle the exchange for them. In most cases, there is a small fee for this personalized service.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nIs it recommended we heat our swimming pool? If so, what is the correct temperature?\nAll swimming pools are required to be heated between December 1 and approximately April 15 (we allow the weather to dictate exact dates). The standard temperature is 85-degrees. While the Member/Guest, on occasion, may request the pool to be heated beyond this point, we discourage this as a higher temperature tends to strain the pool equipment.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhere does a Member/Guest pick up a key when they arrive?\nThis is a common question and, while it seems to be a burden, we ask that all Members and Guests, to ensure the highest level of key integrity, pick up the residence key at the Front Desk. Knowing who is in residence is a very important safety/security initiative. The Front Desk is open 24/7 for the convenience of all Members and Guests.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow often does Housekeeping come and what duties do they perform?\nWhile enjoying a Vacation Rentals’ residence, Members and Guests appreciate the high level of Housekeeping services provided through the Club. This service includes daily housekeeping, which includes emptying the trash cans, removing the soiled towels and replacing with fresh towels and making the beds. Every fourth day, Members and Guests receive full-service housekeeping.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nAre we required to allow a Member/Guest access to our residential elevator?\nWe recommend you keep the elevator for your personal use only. There are special circumstances, however, when it makes perfect sense to permit access. Should a Member/Guest be traveling with an elderly or special needs’ family member, we feel it would be appropriate to allow access to the elevator.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWe purchased a few items for our Ocean Reef residence. May we ship them to Vacation Rentals?\nYou are free to send your items to us at 35 Ocean Reef Drive, Suite 200, Key Largo, Florida 33037. If needed, we would be pleased to bring your items and place them in your residence prior to your arrival, or place them in your Owner’s closet. When shipping items, please inform us in advance so we are prepared for the delivery and include your name on the shipping label to ensure we place the items in the proper residence.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow are rental taxes handled?\nMembers and Guest pay the prevailing tax rates above the daily rental rate. These taxes are held by Ocean Reef and disbursed, as instructed by the appropriate tax authorities, on behalf of the residence owner.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow may I secure Owner’s use reservations or alter a reservation that I already made?\nTo ensure your request is handled promptly and accurately, we recommend you send your desired dates, or changes, to your Lodging Reservations’ team via their group e-mail address:\nReservations@OceanReef.com\n. The Reservations’ office is staffed Monday through Friday from 8am to 7pm and from 8am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. For each individual reservation, you will receive an e-confirmation within 24-hours.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow will I know what my pending reservations are for my residence?\nYou are free to call on us any time and we would be pleased to share this information with you. Please keep in mind that your fellow Members and Guests are rather active so the pending reservations are certainly subject to change.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nIs it possible to have a long-term rental in my residence?\nBy definition, we consider a long-term rental any reservation longer than 28-days. As a courtesy to you, the residence owner, we will tentatively accept the long-term reservation, pending your approval. We appreciate that many of our Members value use of their residence above the rental revenue. We remain committed to ensuring your satisfaction.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow does the Engineering Plan work and may I call to request a repair?\nEach Vacation Rentals’ is supported by the depth of the Club’s Engineering department. This is one of the most comprehensive, and economical, protection plans in the industry. In short, we become your first line of defense. Should any issues arise, we will immediately dispatch an Engineering Associate. Most issues can be quickly resolved. In the event, however, the issue be above our team’s skill set, we will engage the preferred vendor of your choice.\nThis service is available while your residence is vacant or while you, your Guest or a rental Guest is enjoying your residence.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nDoes the Engineering Plan include installation of some interior items?\nOne of the benefits our Members enjoy is complimentary installation of many commonly replaced items including light fixtures, plumbing fixtures and ceiling fans.\nIn the event the requested work is outside the Engineering Plan, labor will be billed at a substantial discount off the standard fees.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nDoes the Club require specific kitchen and housewares inventory?\nAs you know, the Club has established brand standards and we ask that each residence adhere to these standards. While you are not required to use a particular type of kitchen and housewares inventory, we will provide a summary of the items we ask that you consider offering in your residence.\nYour Club has thoughtfully assembled a comprehensive kitchen package inventory, which is available for you to purchase. This high quality package seamlessly transforms your kitchen to a comfortable and impressive presentation. The purchase of the package includes delivery, set-up and the removal of any of the old inventory you do not wish to retain. In addition, should we need to replace a missing or broken item, we carry surplus inventory and can respond quickly to bring your kitchen inventory to full complement.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nDoes the Club assist in other purchase?\nAs you can imagine, the Club has great leverage and purchasing power. As a result of this strength, the Club offers bulk purchasing on items such as electronics, appliances and bedding. While there is seldom substantial savings when we purchase one item, we often facilitate ‘flash sales’, which provides impressive values to our Members.\nBy working through the Club on purchases, in addition to the savings a Member may realize, they enjoy the convenience of the Club handling everything from the ordering, delivery, set-up and the removal of the old inventory, if warranted. Members also enjoy the pleasure of all purchases billed through their Member billing account.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhen I remodel, what should I do with my old furnishings?\nA member may dispose of their old furnishings in any manner they wish. If desired, we can facilitate the disposition to an agency of your choice, or we can simply contact a local source, such as Habitat for Humanity. Usually, these agencies provide a tax receipt for the Member’s personal use.\nIf the Member is not concerned with the tax benefit, one option is to donate the asset to the Club. The Club disposes these furnishings in a variety of ways. The Club supports many charitable organizations and these furnishings help to support these organizations. On occasion, the Club will host Associate lotteries and allow the Associate to take possession of the furnishings for their personal use. Many Associates support family abroad and they ship these furnishings to their extended family.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nI am trying to sell my residence. May I still participate in the Club’s rental program?\nThey say, ‘everything is for sale.’ By this philosophy, our entire collection of Ocean Reef residences is on the market. While we recognize this isn’t the case… we do recognize some of our Members are actively trying to sell their home or condominium. In the event you are considering selling your residence, please let us know. You are certainly welcome to participate in the Club’s rental program while you are attempting to market your residence. We will work in tandem with your real estate professional to ensure we remain a trusted resource and will work to be certain your residence is always looking its best.\nPlease keep in mind that it is important to disclose to the buyer that you are working with the Club so they know there may be some pending reservations, which we may not have the ability to relocate. Disclosing this information will assist in a seamless closing, without compromising the integrity of the Club.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nI have a caretaker for my home. May I retain this person or will I need to release them when I enter the Club’s rental program?\nWhile many Members rely on the Club’s Vacation Rentals’ team to be their property managers, some continue to employ a caretaker for their residence. We respect these relationships and are proud to share that we have worked with most of the professional real estate caretakers here at Ocean Reef.\nWhether it is something as simple as coordinating professional furniture cleaning or a comprehensive residence enhancement, the end goal is to protect the Member’s asset and enhance the value of the Club. The Member’s trust in both the caretaker and the Vacation Rentals’ team is supported by open and transparent communications between all involved.\nIf you currently employ a caretaker please let us know what responsibilities your caretaker will assume so we may work to exceed your expectations.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow will you intend to ‘market’ our Ocean Reef residence?\nWe are often asked this question. Vacation Rentals is Club owned and managed. Thus, you enjoy the depth and breadth of the Club’s global advertising and marketing Plan. This alone is enough to drive the highest levels of desired occupancy and a very respectable daily rate at the Reef. However, generating interest is only the beginning. Your Vacation Rentals’ team is determined to showcase your Ocean Reef home in the best possible way.\nWe are pleased to share that we enjoy an alliance with the foremost, industry provider of on-line visual marketing services. In addition to world-class photography, this partnership will provide interactive floor plans and video of each new residence. As a Member or Guest is considering their accommodations’ options, they will be engaged in a cutting-edge, user-friendly experience.\nNot surprising, some Members and Guests prefer to personally preview residences before they select. Your Vacation Rentals’ team is well prepared for this opportunity and are often in the field showcasing our collection one residence at a time. Rest assured, we work hard to showcase the subtle nuances and special features of each residence.\nIn closing, we diligently work to be completely transparent with our marketing. As a result, whenever there are changes in a residence (furnishings or décor), we engage a professional photographer to capture the new features. After all, we want to exceed the expectations of each and every valued Member and Guest.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhy do you require that participating Members allow up to three complimentary nights in my residence to promote the Club?\nIn some instances, we are provided an opportunity to showcase the Club, and more specifically, the Vacation Rentals’ program. This opportunity may originate from a large group or a VIP. While we traditionally provide lodging at the Inn, we are occasionally able to convince the planner to consider a Vacation Rentals’ residence. This often translates into future measurable values at very respectable rental rates. Rest assured, we would never compromise the trust you have placed in your Club’s rental program. We will surgically evaluate these opportunities and only extend this gift when we determine the long-range net return to you and the Club warrants the courtesy stay.\nIt is important to share that these complimentary nights do not accumulate, or roll over. Each fiscal year begins anew.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat is meant by ‘luxury linens’?\nOur goal is to align the standards within the Vacation Rentals’ program to that of the Inn. Should your Lodging Leadership staff elect to elevate the linens used in the Inn rooms in an effort to elevate Member/Guest experiences, it would be our intent to replicate their decision.\nAt this time, the Inn is not considering using luxury linens. In the event, however, this situation changes, the Club may ask each participating Member to absorb a small portion of this linen fee.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nMay I cancel the rental agreement whenever I wish?\nThe rental agreement automatically renews August 1 of each year. If you wish to not continue with your Club’s rental program, you simply need to send us a short note, at least 30-days prior to August 1, indicating your desire to pull your residence from the program. Please keep in mind that there may be some pending reservations, which we may not have the ability to relocate. We will ask that you honor these pending reservations.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat is Travel Agent commission?\nThere are two areas here: real estate and travel agent commissions. It is rare to see much travel agent activity in the vacation rentals’ environment but your Club does work hard to nurture the relationships we have with the area real estate professionals. The end goal is for the agents to refer their Member clients to the Club for their visits. When they do, we provide a commission to the agent, which reduces the gross rental revenue (prior to the shared arrangement). We offer between 10- and 15%-commission on the rental (not to exceed the first 14-days).\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nI was told there are new ORCA rental rules. What exactly does this mean?\nIn an attempt to build brand integrity within the Club, ORCA is asking Members to adhere to strict regulations as it relates to rentals. While some of the language is simply common sense (i.e.: noise, parking, etc.) there are some changes that directly impact the residence owner. We believe the most important point to consider is, whenever a residence owner is involved in a rental relationship, they must designate a rental manager who must be available 24/7 should there be any issues with the Member/Guest or within the residence.\nIn the case of your Club’s Vacation Rentals’ program, we are pleased to share that your Club’s team is available 24/7, 365 days a year, which ensures any concerns are swiftly addressed.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nI was asked to put bed encasements on my beds. Why is this?\nThis is simply a proactive step to ensure we keep pests out of the Club. You should take comfort in knowing that we currently do not have bed bugs and, by the thoughtful use of bed protectors, we can continue to stand proud.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nHow will we know what other Members/Guests think of our residence?\nOcean Reef Club has been built on traditions of excellence. Further to this point is the Club’s commitment to exceeding each Member and Guest’s expectations. For this reason, the Club solicits feedback from all our Guests on their visit. The survey is extremely comprehensive and covers every aspect of the Club experience including the processing of the reservation, arrival experience, food and beverage venues, recreation, retail and so much more. The in-residence portion of the survey explores the Member/Guest experience with lighting, technology, kitchen inventory, furniture, comfort and housekeeping.\nWe thoughtfully peruse every survey and use this feedback to better understand how we can elevate the Member/Guest experiences. Should the information we learn be of value to you, as the residence owner, we immediately share this with you so we may work together to achieve higher levels of satisfaction.\nVacation Rental Owner FAQs\nWhat is the $25 daily fee a Member and Guest is asked to pay?\nThe daily service charge is $15 for one-bedroom residences and $25 for residences two-bedrooms and larger. This daily fee is often confused with a housekeeping fee. However, this is a Club fee that is received and disbursed to the Club’s hourly Associates, as outlined in the Club’s Human Resources compensation plan.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nAre residences personalized?\nOne of the interesting nuances of the Club’s collection is each residence is individually owned and, as such, offers a unique experience. We do, however, suggest the residence owner remove sentimental décor items.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nAre there restrictions on residences?\nBy default, all Ocean Reef residences are designated as non-smoking residences. Some residences are designated as “Pet Friendly”.\nUnderstanding our number one priority is to protect the Ocean Reef assets; we have implemented and adhere to a very strict Pet Policy. To start, any Member/Guest bringing a pet into a Vacation Rentals’ residence is charged a pet fee. This is not a deposit but rather a fee so we may professionally clean the residence upon departure. Next, our Housekeeping teams are in the residence daily and they are trained to identify any issues within the home. Finally, a property manager will preview the residence immediately upon Rover’s departure to ensure there is no damage inside the home. Naturally, any damage becomes the responsibility of the Member/Guest.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nHow is occupancy in residences determined?\nYour Club carefully manages occupancy levels beginning with how we market a residence, to reservations, to check-in and while providing daily services. At any time, should we have a concern, we immediately address this with the Member/Guest.\nORCA allows occupancy up to two per bedroom and two ‘at large’. Thus, a two-bedroom residence would customarily provide occupancy up to six. And yes, children are people too so they are included when we consider maximum occupancy.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nHow are rental rates determined?\nOcean Reef employs two full-time Revenue professionals who monitor demand and occupancy and establish rates based on these factors and various trends in the luxury travel industry. Rest assured, these Associates understand the travel patterns of your fellow Members, Guests and Group travelers. The success of the effort is driven by offering dynamic rates and, more importantly, Member value.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nIs boat dockage available?\nSome residences certainly provide boat dockage. In some cases, such as a condominium, boat dockage is available, but ‘unassigned’. In short, this simply means the Member/Guest may have the ability to enjoy boat dockage but it is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and is not guaranteed. If boat dockage is desired, we encourage you to contact us for guidance. If the residence you are considering has unassigned boat dockage, we will provide the contact information for the neighborhood association’s dock master. Unauthorized vessels will need to be immediately relocated.\nFor larger boats, Members/Guests may also work directly with the Ocean Reef Marina.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nCan a Member/Guest request an early check-in or late departure?\nBy definition, check-in is after 4pm and check-out is before 11am. In the event a Member/Guest is requesting an early check-in or late check-out, defined as (check-in between 11am and 4pm; check-out between 11am and 6pm), the Member/Guest will be charged 50% of the daily rate for this convenience. In the event there is an arrival on the scheduled date of departure, the late departure request will be respectfully denied. And, should there be a Member/Guest departing that conflicts with the early check-in request, it is likely the request will be respectfully denied.\nOften times, a Member/Guest asks for access to a residence in advance of check-in so they may place some of their perishables in the fridge. While every effort is made to accommodate these requests, we must provide the Club’s teams (i.e.: Housekeeping, Vacation Rentals and Engineering) to facilitate their tasks before we are able to allow access to the residence. As a courtesy, the Bell Stand and Front Desk will assist in storing the perishables prior to check-in.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nCan a Member/Guest enjoy access to the golf cart bay, garage or Owner’s golf cart?\nThe short answer is likely no. The golf cart bay and garages are usually reserved for the Owner’s personal use only. Should a Member/Guest wish to enjoy a golf cart during their stay, we would introduce them to the Club’s Golf Cart Rental team for assistance.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nIs golf cart charging available?\nThis is a commonly asked question and we believe offering cart charging is a thoughtful feature. Please understand, however, this is not always possible. Thus, if the Member or Guest is renting a golf cart from the Club, they are free to return the golf cart as often as they wish and exchange it for a fully charged golf cart. For the convenience of the Member or Guest, the Cart Rental team is also more than pleased to bring the fully charged golf cart to the residence they are enjoying and handle the exchange for them. In most cases, there is a small fee for this personalized service.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nAre swimming pools heated? If so, what is the correct temperature?\nAll swimming pools are heated between December 1 and approximately April 15 (we allow the weather to dictate exact dates). The standard temperature is 85-degrees. While the Member/Guest, on occasion, may request the pool to be heated beyond this point, we may decline this request as a higher temperature tends to strain the pool equipment.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nWhere does a Member/Guest pick up a key when they arrive?\nWe ask that all Members and Guests, to ensure the highest level of key integrity, pick up the residence key at the Front Desk. Knowing who is in residence is a very important safety/security initiative. The Front Desk is open 24/7 for the convenience of all Members and Guests. Upon departure, all keys should be returned to the Front Desk.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nWill we have access to the residential elevator?\nIn most cases, the residential elevator will not be available for use. There are special circumstances when it makes perfect sense to permit access. Should a Member/Guest be traveling with an elderly or special needs’ family member, please contact us so we may explore the elevator usage together.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nWe like to travel with special kitchen items. May we ship them to Vacation Rentals in advance of our arrival?\nYou are free to send your items to us at 35 Ocean Reef Drive, Suite 200, Key Largo, Florida 33037. If needed, we would be pleased to bring your items and place them in your residence prior to your arrival. When shipping items, please inform us in advance so we are prepared for the delivery and include your name on the shipping label to ensure we place the items in the proper residence.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nHow are rental taxes handled?\nMembers and Guest pay the prevailing tax rates above the daily rental rate. These taxes are held by Ocean Reef and disbursed, as instructed by the appropriate tax authorities.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nIs it possible to enjoy a long-term rental in a residence?\nBy definition, we consider a long-term rental any reservation longer than 28-days. As a courtesy to the residence owner, we will tentatively accept the long-term reservation, pending the owner’s approval. We appreciate that many of our Members value use of their residence above the rental revenue.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nWhat should we do if we have an issue while enjoying a Vacation Rentals’ residence?\nEach Vacation Rentals’ is supported by the depth of the Club’s Engineering department. This is one of the most comprehensive protection plans in the industry. In short, we become your first line of defense. Should any issues arise, we will immediately dispatch an Engineering Associate. Most issues can be quickly resolved. In the event, however, the issue is above our team’s skill set, we will engage, as quickly as possible, the preferred vendor of the owner’s choice.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nDoes the Club require specific kitchen and housewares inventory?\nAs you know, the Club has established brand standards and we ask that each residence adhere to these standards. While the residence owner is not required to use a particular type of kitchen and housewares inventory, we will provide a summary of the items we ask that they consider offering in the residence.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nI was told there are new ORCA rental rules. What exactly does this mean?\nIn an attempt to build brand integrity within the Club, ORCA is asking Members to adhere to strict regulations as it relates to rentals. Most of the language is simply common sense (i.e.: noise, parking, etc.). For specific questions regarding ORCA, please feel free to call us.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nHow will the residence owner know what we think of their residence?\nOcean Reef Club has been built on traditions of excellence. Further to this point is the Club’s commitment to exceeding each Member and Guest’s expectations. For this reason, the Club solicits feedback from all our Guests on their visit. The survey is extremely comprehensive and covers every aspect of the Club experience including the processing of the reservation, arrival experience, food and beverage venues, recreation, retail and so much more. The in-residence portion of the survey explores the Member/Guest experience with lighting, technology, kitchen inventory, furniture, comfort and housekeeping.\nWe thoughtfully peruse every survey and use this feedback to better understand how we can elevate the Member/Guest experiences. Should the information we learn be of value to the residence owner, we immediately share this with them and work together to achieve higher levels of satisfaction.\nVacation Rental Guest FAQs\nWhat is the $25 daily fee a Member and Guest is asked to pay?\nThe daily service charge is $15 for one-bedroom residences and $25 for residences two-bedrooms and larger. This daily fee is often confused with a housekeeping fee. However, this is a Club fee that is received and disbursed to the Club’s hourly Associates, as outlined in the Club’s Human Resources compensation plan\nQUICK LINKS\nRequest Your Copy of Living Magazine\nPhoto Gallery\nLocation\nCareers\nReal Estate\nExecutive Team\nMember Login\nPrivacy Policy\nVendor Code of Conduct\nADA Statement\nMember Payment Portal\nSEARCH\nsearch\nSEARCH\n1-800-741-7333\nCONNECT WITH US\nfacebook\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\nGenerator: Adobe Illustrator 20.0.0, SVG Export Plug-In .

At the heart of it all are our Members and their families, their cherished traditions passed down through generations, and the unmistakable beauty that is apparent not only in the environment but in everyday moments.\nWhile words may fall short in capturing this uniqueness, this calendar aims to illustrate it. The photos selected for this year’s theme, “Colors of The Reef,” depict the picturesque beauty of Ocean Reef Club through its nature, its vibrant Membership, its lively events, and even in the often-overlooked details, from the most meticulously-crafted cocktails to the most vibrant sunsets.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW\nYOUR 2024-2025 CALENDAR\nband\nband-wrap\nalternative1\nAn Excellence in Standards\nThe Dress Code is designed to complement today’s more casual lifestyles while still respecting the Club’s longstanding traditions and the excellence in standards for which the Club is noted.
