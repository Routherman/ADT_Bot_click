Don’t miss out on the action – click here to familiarize yourself with our house rules and join the excitement today!\nReady to deal you in, are you up for the challenge?\nThree Card Poker\nThree Card Poker pits the player’s hand against the dealer’s in a heads-up match. After placing ante bets, each party receives three cards, with players then deciding to fold or match their ante with a “play” wager. The reveal comes next; the dealer’s hand must be Queen high to qualify. If the dealer doesn’t qualify, ante bets are paid out at even money, and play wagers are returned. If the dealer qualifies and the player wins, both ante and play wagers pay even money, a tie results in a push. Players can also place additional bets like the Pair Plus, which pays out if the player’s hand contains a pair or better, and the Ante Bonus for straight or better hands, offering payouts up to 5 to 1, with both these bets winning irrespective of the dealer’s hand.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nCrazy 4 Poker\n“Crazy 4 Poker” is an exhilarating card game that involves head-to-head play against the dealer and features two bonus bets. Players start by making equal Ante and Super Bonus wagers, with an optional Queens Up wager. Each player and the dealer receive five cards to create the best four-card poker hand. Players can fold or continue by matching their Ante or betting up to three times their Ante with a pair of Aces or better. Winning involves beating the dealer’s qualifying hand or benefiting when the dealer does not qualify. The game also includes special payouts for high-ranking hands like four Aces.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nFace Up Pai Gow Poker\nFace Up Pai Gow Poker spices up the classic game by dealing the dealer’s seven cards face-up, adding a new level of strategy with head-to-head play against the dealer. This variant also features the optional Fortune Bonus and Ace-High side bets, enhancing the excitement of the game.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nDouble D’s Wild Card Stud\nDouble D’s Wild Stud Poker is a captivating five-card game featuring a Designated Player, against whom all other participants play. Like other poker variations with this role, the Designated Player is responsible for collecting losses and distributing winnings, up to the amount of their wager, adding a unique and engaging twist to the traditional poker experience.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nFortune Pai Gow Poker\nFortune Pai Gow Poker offers an enticing optional bonus bet focusing on the strongest hand you can assemble from your seven cards. Place any bet within the table’s limits, but keep in mind that a minimum Fortune bet of $5 not only ups the ante but also makes you eligible for the coveted Envy Bonus payouts, adding an extra layer of excitement to your game. This game is played with 53 cards, including the joker.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nUltimate Texas Hold ’em\nIn Ultimate Texas Hold ’em, the goal is to craft a five-card hand that tops the dealer’s, using two personal cards and five community cards. It encourages assertive betting, the earlier the bet, the higher the stakes and potential winnings. Bets placed pre-flop can be three or four times the Ante, while a bet on the flop allows for doubling the Ante. Waiting for the river means bets can only match the Ante. Additionally, the game spices things up with an optional Trips bonus wager, rewarding players whose final hand is at least a three of a kind.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nI Luv Suits\n“I Luv Suits” is an engaging card game where the main objective is to outdo the dealer by having more cards of the same suit, regardless of their rank. Players can place multiple wagers including Flush Rush and Flush Rush Bonus bets. The game begins with an Ante wager, followed by the option to raise the stakes depending on the strength of the player’s flush. The excitement of the game comes from the strategic decisions in betting and the potential for high payouts based on the number of suited cards. This game offers a fresh twist on traditional poker, providing an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy card games with a unique challenge.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY",

Our commitment to your enjoyment is evident in every corner, from the lively Tiki Bar and engaging pickleball courts to the pulsating rhythms of live concerts.\n◆ ◆ ◆\nOur Poker Games\nStep right up to the ultimate poker experience at our tables, where seven thrilling poker variations await to test your skill and luck! These poker games are played 9-handed. Whether you’re a fan of the classics or eager to try something new, our selection has something for every poker enthusiast. Don’t miss out on the action—click here to familiarize yourself with our house rules and join the excitement today!\nReady to deal you in, are you up for the challenge?\nRanking of Hands\nThere’s many different hands contained in a deck of cards including a royal flush, full, house, straight, two pair, and flush.\nLEARN THE RANKING OF HANDS\n7 Card Stud\nExperience the excitement of Seven-Card Stud Poker, where each player is strategically dealt seven cards over five rounds — starting with two hidden and one revealed card, followed by three rounds of face-up cards, and concluding with a final card dealt face down. After each round, the tension builds with a round of betting, culminating in a showdown where players choose their best five-card hand from their individual seven-card ensemble. It’s a test of foresight, strategy, and nerves, perfect for poker aficionados seeking a twist on the classic game.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\n7 Card Stud Hi-Lo\nIn 7 Stud Hi-Lo, the thrill doubles as the pot is divided equally between the highest and the lowest hand. To claim the low half of the pot, a player must present a qualifying hand of five distinct cards, all ranking 8 or lower, with straights and flushes not affecting the low hand eligibility. This twist adds a layer of strategy, as players aim to scoop both halves of the pot with hands skillfully crafted to win high and qualify low.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nOmaha\nOmaha is a community card poker game akin to Texas hold ’em. Players receive four cards each and must forge their best hand using a precise combination of two personal cards and three from the five communal cards laid out on the table, demanding a keen strategy and sharp decision-making.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nOmaha Hi-Lo\nOmaha Hi-Lo, a dynamic poker variant, incorporates a “qualifier” for the low hand where all cards must be ranked eight or lower. In this game, players are dealt four individual cards and strive to construct the superior hand by selecting exactly two of their own cards and three from the five community cards on the table, adding an intriguing layer of strategy in pursuit of both high and low winning combinations.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nTexas Hold ’em\nTexas Hold ’em is a widely favored poker variant where players each receive two private ‘hole’ cards and share five community cards, revealed in three stages: first three cards (‘the flop’), then one additional card (‘the turn’), and a final card (‘the river’). Participants aim to craft the strongest five-card hand possible using any combination of their hole cards and the community cards, making for a game full of strategy and anticipation.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nPineapple Hold ’em\nPineapple poker tweaks the Texas Hold ’em format by dealing players three ‘hole’ cards instead of two. Alongside the five community cards revealed in the traditional three stages—the ‘flop,’ ‘turn,’ and ‘river’—players work to assemble the best five-card hand. The additional hole card adds a layer of complexity and strategic depth, as players decide not only which cards to keep but also which to discard, heightening the anticipation and strategic maneuvering of the game.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY\nCrazy Pineapple Hold ’em\nCrazy Pineapple poker starts like the regular version, with each player receiving three hole cards. The twist comes as players hold all three cards through the initial betting rounds, only discarding one before the ‘turn’ card is dealt. Beyond this distinctive rule, all other gameplay elements, including betting structures and the quest to build the best hand, remain identical to standard Pineapple poker, offering a familiar yet refreshingly unpredictable twist on the classic game.\nLEARN HOW TO PLAY",
