The first Banana Boat opened in September 1971, in Fort Lauderdale, on Commercial Blvd east of U.S.1. John Therien and his sons, Pierre, Luke and Gilles, moved the Banana Boat to Boynton Beach in 1978, on Ocean Avenue and the Intracoastal Waterway.\nPrime Catch opened on June 1, 2004 to rave reviews. Zagat rated Prime Catch “Best New Restaurant in Palm Beach County” after its first year. Restaurant reviews have continued to praise Prime Catch for being the first important fine dining destination to arrive in Boynton Beach. Prime Catch is known to have the freshest fish in the area, along with a new approach to flavors and ambiance.\nThe Theriens are completely dedicated to the restaurant business. They support the community through fundraisers, the Chamber of Commerce, and are loyal to their customers, staff, and vendor partners.\nGeneral Manager\nAmy Potter\nAmy Potter began with Prime Catch in May 2016. She worked as a Server, then Captain,\nthen quickly moved into Management. Amy has been General Manager since 2023.\nAmy grew up in Wooster, Ohio, and Graduated from the University of Cincinnati. Amy’s first career took her into Retail Fashion, as a Buyer.\nAmy’s energy level eventually pulled her away from Retail Buying, and into the Hospitality\nbusiness. She began by working and learning in the corporate chains while steadily moving\ninto Upscale Dining. Amy’s appreciation of high-end wines motivated her to work full-time as a Wine Consultant for three years, before getting back into upscale hospitality.\nAfter moving to Boynton Beach in 1999, she and her husband were frequent “Sunday Brunch”\nguests at Prime Catch. It just felt natural to her that in 2016 she would become a\nteam member at Prime Catch. Amy’s past experience in the wine industry has helped\nPrime Catch to develop an outstanding wine program. And Amy’s passion for M’aitre D’ style\nhospitality ensures that every Guest has a memorable dining experience.\nLet's Eat\nOpen Lunch & Dinner Daily\nBe inspired by our award winning, certified culinary chef and his staff.\nBe pampered by our highly trained, professional staff.\nReservations\nPrime Catch Restaurant\n700 East Woolbright Road\nBoynton Beach, FL 33435\n561-737-8822\nOpen Daily\nSun-Thu: 11:00am-9:00pm\nFri-Sat:\n11:00am-10:00pm\nCopyright © 2025 Restaurant Holdings, Inc.\nMenu\nGift Cards\nCareers\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n.entry-content .clear\n#post-##\n.entry-header\nAbout Us\nLocally Owned\nESTABLISHED 2004\nThe Therien family started in the restaurant business in 1971.
