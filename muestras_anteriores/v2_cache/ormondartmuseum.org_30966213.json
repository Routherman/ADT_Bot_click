The pieces, or “shards,” are made from the leftover clay from my extruder. After each clay extrusion, the extruder tube is left to dry out until the next use. When I saw how thin and fragile the dried clay had become, I thought it would be a challenge to see how many pieces I could save without breaking them. I love how they stack inside each other and create dimension and structure, hence the name Nestle. The best part is when light shines onto the piece, creating all kinds of interesting shadows. Sometimes, when the light is shown onto it, they almost look like birds nestling together.\n2023\n2023\nChristine Alfery\nYour Mind Sings - Listen\n2023\nAcrylic on paper, 44\" x 34\" x 0\"\nThe controlled mapping of the face, and the controlled brushwork within the mapping, were so different for me. I pride myself on never coloring within the lines. While I was frustrated with the lack of free spontaneous marking and form-making that I so enjoy when creating, I continued to fill in the spaces to see where the work would take me. Later when I returned to work, I immediately created the red-orange hair and was able to stand back and say \"she is finished.\" I listened to the music the work was singing to me. At first, with the controlled mark-making it was like a controlled symphony slowly, slowly building and then a crescendo of the symphony happened with a burst of red-orange hair, making the work very experimental for me. In the end I enjoyed the statement the work made, it speaks of the contrast of robotic control, the machine, and the fluid flow of creativity.\n2022\n2022\nJean Pederson\nBlink\n2022\nMixed media, 30\" x 30\" x 2\"\nI’ve been integrating the ideas of time and movement from quantum mechanics into my practice. Transforming realism into distorted or shifting shapes offers my mixed media a new fresh approach.\n\"When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\" — Max Planck\n2021\n2021\nDennis Salaty\nThe Dwelling\n2021\nMixed media assemblage, acrylic and found objects, 12\" x 12\" x 3\"\nI usually work with acrylic, collage and assemblage. This piece was experimental for me because I used different materials to create an assemblage-type painting. I experimented using a canvas panel as a base to construct the piece. I also experimented by using new materials, such as the course pumice gel that covers the canvas, which I never used before.\nAbout the ISEA\nThe International Society of Experimental Artists was founded in 1991 with the idea that artists working in an experimental manner need a society where they can share ideas and techniques - both old and new and encourage the development of new talents and skills. There is a need to connect, encourage, inform and promote artists who create art by experimentation and exploration. The Society offers members three opportunities a year to exhibit their work, with the annual INNOVATIONS/Symposium as an opportunity to exhibit in a public space. The International Society of Experimental Artists' mission is to enthusiastically embrace creative thinking, imagination and experimentation. We promote public interest in experimental art, and encourage and support artists' creative journeys through exhibition, education and communication. ISEA has had about 500 members In the USA and around the world.\nEND .primary_content\nEND .wrap",

Thomas Brown, MD\n1948-2024\nDr. Brown was an active member of OMAM's Board of Directors from 2011 to 2024. He served as treasurer from 2012 to 2014, vice president from 2014-2015, and president from 2016 to 2018.\nDr. Brown attended Johns Hopkins University, West Virginia University, University of Miami, and the University of South Florida. He was appointed a Diplomat of the American Board of Urology in 1980 and practiced in Daytona Beach from 1978-2014. He led a distinguished career in administrative medicine and Urology.\nHe was extremely active in his community outside of medicine. He also was appointed to the Board of Directors for the Daytona Beach Rotary Club. He was a member of First United Methodist Church, Civic League of the Halifax Area, and also served on the Board of Directors for the University Club and Tiger Bay of Volusia County.\nHe loved fine art, good food, and the West Virginia Mountaineers. No matter the venue, he was the consummate networker you could often find him socializing at the Halifax River Yacht Club, having been a member there since 1987. When not traveling to visit his grandchildren, he loved traveling the world, and passed away July 14, 2024 on his last international trip with Al cruising through Greece and Turkey. Some of his proudest moments were giving gifts to his loved ones that he had handpicked on his far-away journeys.\nDr. Brown is survived by his daughter, Elizabeth Timbrook Brown, MD, MPH and her husband, David Hulan Hastings, and their two children Lucas Skelton Hastings (5), and Whitney Elizabeth Hastings (2); and his son James Schuyler Brown, Esq. and his wife, Amelia Pearson Brown, and their two children James Dean Brown (2) and Harper James Brown (7 months). He is also survived by Kimberlee Timbrook Brown, MD, his former wife of 32 years, and his current long-term partner of over 10 years, Edward Alton Adams.\nIn memory of their art-loving father, Brook and Schuyler Brown request, in lieu of flowers, that donations be made in their father’s honor to the\nOrmond Memorial Art Museum\n.\nA memorial service will be held at 3:00 p.m. Friday, Aug. 2, 2024 at Haigh-Black Funeral Home, 167 Vining Court, Ormond Beach.
