      "text": "Builder #page\nAbout Us\nSam’s Beach Bar has a history that dates back to the early days of Hudson Florida.\nOur Story\nFrom an igloo to a beach bar\nSam’s Hudson Beach Snack Bar was purchased by the Marisi family in 1981… Eddie Marisi had a dream of owning a waterfront restaurant … he was visiting some friends that lived in Port Richey and stumbled across what was an “igloo like building selling hot dogs, hamburgers, ice cream and snacks right on Hudson Beach.”\nGrace Marisi went in to buy a lemonade and ask if it was by chance for sale… and it WAS! So the Marisi family packed up and left Long Island NY to live Eddies dream…\nFamily History\nFamily History\nSam’s was built on a lot of hard work and long hour days…\nEddie, Grace and their daughter Sara (10 at the time) lived, ate and breathed the business… and it showed in the growth of the restaurant and to what it is today… Eddie passed at age 53 in 1998.. Grace and Sara continued to run it … Grace passed on in 2007 …\nSara still continues to run the business with her husband Brad and A TON of help from all the staff … Sara says …we have had some ups and downs… we have been through fires, floods and a global pandemic and we always come back stronger … our vision was always to make Sam’s a fun family environment. We have beautiful sunsets, awesome service, great food and refreshing drinks and we want to share that with everyone!",
