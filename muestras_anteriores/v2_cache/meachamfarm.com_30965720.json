Located in the heart of Tampa Bay, Meacham Urban Farm serves as a beacon of high-quality food and valuable agricultural experiences. Since its inception, the farm has grown exponentially, offering a variety of local organic goods and hosting enriching events that connect individuals with the source of their food.\nMeacham Urban Farm is representing the local food movement by creating a healthy community through high quality food and valuable experiences.\nMeacham Urban Farm transformed an otherwise vacant 2-acre lot into a productive greenspace located downtown. The farm is integrated into the Encore redevelopment project, a 1,500-unit mixed income housing and mixed-use subsidized neighborhood. The farm was built in collaboration with the Tampa Housing Authority, Hillsborough County School District, and two independent farmers: Joe Dalessio and Travis Malloy. The initial grant awarded to the Meacham project was used entirely for the farm’s infrastructure buildout. Since completing this phase, Meacham Urban Farm has sustained itself as a small agricultural business through direct-to-consumer produce sales and event revenue. Over the past few years, Meacham Urban Farm has evolved into a model of urban sustainability and local food production, through dedication and community support.\nOur farming ethos is to grow the highest quality, nutrient dense food we possibly can, through cultural practices that promote soil health and work in conjunction with nature. We grow on a permanent bed system minimally disturbing the soil. We manage our crops using mechanical cultivation, organic fertilizers, cover cropping, crop rotations, and integrated pest management. Our crops are always free from pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilizers.\nMeacham Urban Farm hosts numerous events throughout each vegetable season that play a vital role in fostering community engagement. From educational sessions to dining experiences and private gatherings, these events offer valuable opportunities for visitors to connect with the farm firsthand. By emphasizing where food comes from and how its grown, Meacham events actively promote the local food movement. Guests are inspired to develop a deeper appreciation for local food, build relationships with their farmers, adopt healthier diet choices, and contribute to a thriving local food community.\nOur commitment to sustainable farming practices ensures that we provide high-quality, fresh produce directly to consumers through our on-site market, farm events, and local partnerships.\nLocation:\nMeacham Urban Farm is named after Christina Meacham, who had served as principal in 1914 of Tampa’s first African American school, Harlem Academy. The school sat in the area known as the ‘’Scrub’’ where the farm is located today. We want to continue the neighborhood’s educational heritage by transforming Meacham Urban Farm into a welcoming hands-on educational resource for the school district students and the public.\nMeacham Urban Farm\nMeacham Urban Farm is a thriving agricultural venture dedicated to sustainable farming practices and community growth.
