      "text": "About us\n“Still Stinkin’ After All These Years!” The “Best Stinkin’ Party in South Florida” returns to celebrate 26 years of garlicky goodness! Join us as this Internationally Award-Winning Event continues the tradition of being “The” signature food and entertainment event in South Florida.\nEat, drink & STINK with us at\nVillage of Wellington Amphitheater!\nIt all started out as a small festival in a city parking lot in Downtown Delray Beach just as this Village by the Sea was becoming the vibrant tourist destination it is today. Within five years the event gained attendance of 20,000+ and was booking major national music acts! Around that time, The Garlic Fest was nicknamed “The Best Stinkin’ Party in South Florida”.\nGarlic Fest is a community celebration of food, music, and art.\nIn addition to great food, Garlic Fest showcases a diverse and eclectic selection of national musical acts including Expendables, The Wailers, G Love & Special Sauce, Buddy Guy, Stephen Marley, Michael Franti, Dispatch, Rebelution, Steel Pulse, The Mighty Mighty BosstoneS, Dark Star Orchestra, Bad Fish, Collective Soul, Sister Hazel and Trombone Shorty and Drake White, just to name just a few. Stay tuned for who we bring to the stage this year!\nDelray Beach Arts is a nonprofit community-based organization that produces events in Palm Beach County. Founded by a group of local folks looking to establish a fund-raising source for local non-profit organizations and to support art & educational programs for Palm Beach County local businesses. Started in 1998, the South Florida Garlic Fest is a key signature cultural event in south Florida, as well as a successful fundraiser. The South Florida Garlic Fest is a gathering that excites the communal spirit and it enriches the fabric of Palm Beach County life.\nWith the community’s support, Delray Beach Arts, Inc. has distributed $696,466 to nonprofit and volunteer organizations to date.\nIn 2020 Garlic Fest brought international attention to Lake Worth on Jeopardy’s Game Show in March as a featured question! “The Isle of Wight & Lake Worth Florida both have annual festivals honoring this pungent bulb & its endless potential”.",
