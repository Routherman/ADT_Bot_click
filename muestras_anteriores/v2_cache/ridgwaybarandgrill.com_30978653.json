His unabated love of all things cooking continues. From the earliest days of The Wurst Place, which Tony opened on 12\nth\nAvenue South in Old Naples in 1971, through the heyday of The Chef’s Garden and Truffles, Plum’s Café and Villa Pescatore, and continuing today in the traditions of Ridgway Bar & Grill and our sister restaurant, Bayside Seafood Grill & Bar, the focus has been on delivering a consistently excellent experience to our guests.\nT\nhe same can be said for Sukie’s wine program. Sukie joined forces with Tony in 1979 and has ever since been cultivating a peerless knowledge base about the wine world, earning the respect and friendship of vintners throughout the United States and internationally. Her wine lists are hand-selected and regularly updated to reflect what’s new and interesting, as well as always including a broad selection of classic favorites. All regions and varietals are represented, as well as something to suit all price points. Additionally, Sukie is your go-to at Ridgway for planning your most memorable private party. Handling all the details with you from start to finish, Sukie will ensure your special occasion is the best yet.\nT\nony and Sukie, today, are considered local legends for the influence they have had on the Naples restaurant scene. Ridgway Bar & Grill, in its location off Third Street South in Old Naples located two blocks from the famous Naples beaches, serves lunch and dinner daily, as well as weekend brunch. Our dining areas include our front porch facing 13\nth\nAvenue South, our European-style Courtyard surrounding the fountain, our beautiful garden, side patio facing the garden, and our bar and lounge and indoor dining rooms, including our private dining room. We are open year-round including all major holidays! We accommodate private parties of all sizes.\nT\nony and Sukie pride themselves on this being a small family business. Many of our customers who have been dining with us for years say that the warm and welcoming atmosphere brings them back again and again. Open 365 days of the year, serving lunch and dinner daily, as well as Saturday and Sunday brunch, Ridgway Bar & Grill truly offers something for everyone.\nWe offer regular as well as seasonal\nspecials and events\n, and\ngift cards\nare a great way to treat your favorite people to the Ridgway experience!
