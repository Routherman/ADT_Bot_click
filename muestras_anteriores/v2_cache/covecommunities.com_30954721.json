For more than two decades, the Cove team has successfully acquired, operated and continuously worked to develop and enhance premier Manufactured Home Communities, RV Parks and Resorts.\nOur Company\nWe bring our 20+ years of experience to every resort and community we own and acquire, infusing camaraderie and a village-like atmosphere. At Cove Communities, we are committed to investing in properties, and by doing so, improving lives and the world around us.\nWe invest in the most desirable amenities and activities, and are known for providing outstanding customer service, so that our residents and guests can enjoy the lifestyle of their dreams. We’re proud to create resorts and communities with a village-like atmosphere that we, and our closest friends and family members, would be delighted to call home.\nOur Mission\nTo own and operate communities in prime destinations that offer a lifestyle guests and residents love to live.\nOur Vision\nTo create a world where exceptional customer service and generosity are second nature and hospitality is a passion.\nOur Culture\nWe’re passionate about making Cove Communities the best possible place to work, visit, and live.
