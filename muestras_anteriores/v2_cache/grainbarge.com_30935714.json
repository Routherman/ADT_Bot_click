Built in 1936 by the Charles Hill shipyard, the barge is now moored in Hotwells, opposite its original berth and near to Brunel’s ss Great Britain.\nThe boat was bought and refitted in 2007. The new interior uses reclaimed and recycled materials that reflect the boat’s industrial heritage.\nToday, Grain Barge is a relaxed and friendly bar/restaurant with spectacular views across Bristol harbour and the iconic ss Great Britain. Serving fresh, locally-sourced dishes and a range of craft beers, ciders, wines and coffees, this unique venue also hosts a programme of live music and comedy from its intimate Hold Bar. Relax below deck and enjoy panoramic views of the river from the light, bright restaurant/bar or sit up-top and watch river life glide past.\nStrike a light for independents\nWe support and champion independent, local business. Founded on Grain Barge owner George Ferguson’s belief that independent businesses are the lifeblood of our city, Grain Barge is proudly reliant on independent brewers, producers and suppliers.\nOpen:\nMon-Thu 12-11.00pm | Fri-Sat 12-11.30pm | Sun 12-10pm\nWe’re a dog friendly barge!\n<div class=\"right-column image\" style=\"background-image:url('https://grainbarge.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Neil-James-Brain-copy.jpg');\"></div>\nKey People\nSarah Ford\nManaging Director\nHaving joined Tobacco Factory at the outset to set up the Cafe Bar in 2001, Sarah oversees all aspects of Tobacco Factory's Cafe Bar, including events, the Sunday Market as well as Grain Barge.\nCharles Mooyaart\nExecutive Chef\nCharles joins us with a mission to spread his belief that food should be ethical and fun - bringing people together with classic dishes made with locally sourced seasonal ingredients.\nTim Myers\nFacilities Manager\nLooking after all aspects of the Tobacco Factory building and the Grain Barge, Tim is a self confessed construction nerd and is never happier than when calculating wall thickness and heat retention.\nFiona Milsom\nFi is the Queen Of Content. She heads up our social media, catch her at the venue phone in hand making the staff pose, but don't get too close, she'll make you be in a Tiktok.\nKatie Holloway\nGraphic Designer and Exhibition Curator\nKatie is the graphic designer + sign writer across the TFE venues, also organising the exhibitions at Tobacco Factory and Grain Barge, sharing the amazing work of Bristol’s local artists. Outside of work, you can find Katie exploring Bristol's green spaces, riding her bike or painting murals on walls with the Bristol Mural Collective.\nBristol Pound\nBristol Pound is changing!\nFrom the team at Bristol Pound, Bristol Pay is your new non-profit payment account that’s doing good things for Bristol.\nBristol Pay will prevent money leaving our city through transaction charges, and generate funds for local community and environmental projects.\nFind out more\nSign up\nView the Bristol Pound directory",
