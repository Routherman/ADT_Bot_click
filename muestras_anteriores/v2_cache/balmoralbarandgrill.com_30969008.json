Our server welcomed us, introduced herself and was constantly attending us to make sure our needs were met. She was amazing.\nThe whole evening was great from beginning to end. We have now started going to Karaoke night, Latin night, and plan on attending more events.\nThank you!\nWendy Mata\nThank you so much for letting us practice today. The dancers really enjoyed using their passes or buying tickets to use the Waterpark after their rehearsal.\nYour staff was wonderful today, from Chrissy’s efficiency in messaging me about filling out waivers ahead of time, to Keyshon unlocking the gate for us, to your restaurant manager cleaning and preparing our rehearsal space. The restaurant’s food and service were great and we enjoyed hearing the laughter of children playing around the Waterpark.\nOverall, it was a 10 out of 10 day and we hope to make you proud during our next visit on Saturday.\nThank you again!\nStudio C School of Dance and Productions\nContact\nBalmoral Bar & Grill\nThank you for your interest in Balmoral Bar and Grill.
