Over the past few years, she’s enjoyed diving deeper into the production, sustainability, and future of air shows, and she looks forward to continuing to shape a family-friendly, community-oriented event in Punta Gorda.\n﻿\n\"The Florida International Air Show is highly respected by performers and throughout the Air Show industry,” Denise added. “My goal is to help our community understand just how much everyone loves coming here. I want to share the enthusiasm, excitement, and energy that fuels our board and volunteers—and make sure the whole community feels like they are part of the Air Show team!”\nDenise began her Air Show journey volunteering at the VIP gate, later moved on to vending ice-cold beverages, and eventually joined the Board of Directors. Her favorite moment? Seeing the crowd light up as jets roar overhead.\n“An Air Show is like taking football, pizza, beer, baseball, fireworks, NASCAR, and Skynyrd—and rolling it all into one event with a bang! If you haven’t been to an Air Show, you’re missing out. It's a family friendly experience full of excitement, education and entertainment. Who couldn't use a few more moments like that?\"\nFAVORTE PLANE\nJets of course!\nMajor Mike Anderson\nVice President\nFLORIDA INTERNATIONAL AIR SHOW APPOINTS FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT IN 42 YEAR HISTORY\nOriginally from Chicago, I moved to Charlotte County in 1987 and starting working for Public Works, I then moved on to the Sheriff's Office in 1989. During my time in the Sheriff's Office I have been fortunate to rise to my current level of Major in charge of the Bureau of Law Enforcement. I have a Master's degree in Criminal Justice Administration and a graduate of the FBI National Academy. I raised two wonderful daughters in Charlotte County and have 7 grandkids. During my 29 years in Law Enforcement I have worked both the Summer and Winter Olympics and traveled around the work for the Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics. Some of the charities that I am passionate about include, Special Olympics, Habitat for Humanity and Big Brothers Big Sisters.\nI attended my first airshow in 1984 while visiting my parents who had just moved to Charlotte County. It was an awesome event and to be finally part of the team will make each show even more special.\n“I look forward to my grandkids coming to the Air Show each year to be as amazed as\n﻿\nI was my first time.”\nChristine Mann\nSecretary\nTony Smith\nTreasurer\nFAVORITE PLANE\nLoud and FAST! Any jet will do however the A-10's just look cool.\nDana Carr\nChairman\nDana has been with Air Trek since its inception in 1978. An ATP pilot with more than 8,000 hours of flight experience, he is type rated in the Cessna Citation and holds Commercial Pilot single engine land and sea and Helicopter licensure by the FAA.\nDana was approved by the FAA to serve in the required position of Director of Operations in 1984 and has served in that position for the past 28 years. He is currently holding the position of Board Member. He has been continually qualified as a pilot for Air Trek since 1979.\nDana has served for 9 years as President and/or on the Board of Directors of the Professional Aeromedical Transport Association (PATA). From 1999 to 2008 he served on the Board of the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS) as a representative from the National Aviation Transportation Association (NATA). Dana has been awarded the Certified Medical Transport Executive (CMTE) designation by the Association of Air Medical Services. He currently serves as an active member of the Air Charter Committee of NATA.\nIn 2006 Dana was responsible for spearheading the development of Air Trek’s Safety Management System (SMS) which was one of the first to be accepted in the USA. Canada and European countries now require SMS for their aviation operators and soon it will be required in the U.S. As a result of Dana’s safety minded vision, Air Trek’s SMS has been in place for years.\nDana’s main responsibility is overseeing daily operations and logistics of the company which can include multiple simultaneous operations both domestically and on other continents.\n“The Florida International Air Show has a special place in my heart with many family memories.”\nI have been involved in every Air Show since the 1st one in 1982, mostly as an on airport business helping with whatever was required for the show to go on. Our business and children grew along with the Air Show. To have been part of the TEAM who worked to bring back the Air Show in 2016 and fast-tracked to the 2018 Air Show President is indeed an honor.\nConnie Hite\nDirector of Aviation\nConnie Hite was born and raised in Indiana but has found her way to Florida joining the FIAS Board of Directors as Director of Volunteers. Connie is a retired Special Agent with the United States Secret Service,  having served twenty-eight (28) years in Federal Law Enforcement.  Some of Connie’s past experiences include coordinating personnel and logistics for Presidential Inaugurations, United Nations General Assembly and multiple other world stage events. She began her aviation career in 2019 and became a Certified Flight Instructor for Paragon Flight Training in 2022, which coincidentally was the year she took fastest Piper aircraft and second place overall as part of an all women team participating in the cross country Air Race Classic. Connie is a strong advocate for women in aviation, serving as Chairman of Paradise Coast 99’s, a local chapter of the women pilot organization. She loves bringing awareness to the vast opportunities available to anyone in the field of aviation, no matter what their age may be.\nSteve Lineberry\nDirector of Advertising & Media\nSteve Lineberry, Media & Public Relations Director has been a member the FIAS Board of Directors since 2017. His first Air Show was in 2004, when he worked as a member of the Port Charlotte Sunrise Kiwanis Club in their food tent cooking hundreds of hot dogs and hamburgers. In 2017, Steve joined the FIAS Board of Directors and was responsible working with media companies across SW FL to market the Air Show. He has worn several hats throughout the various Air Shows – Media Marketing and Ticket Coordinator.  When asked why he worked hundreds of hours as a Volunteer – Steve replied – “The Florida International Air Show is a lot of work and working alongside the FIAS Board of Directors to ensure the best Air Show possible has been extremely gratifying. But most importantly, the FIAS Air Show gives back a portion of the net proceeds to over 30 working non-profits and it is an opportunity to make my corner of the world a little bit better.”\nAbigail White\nDirector of Volunteers\nMy name is Abby White. I’ve been a part of the Florida International Air Show for 2 years now, starting as the Assistant Director of Volunteers in 2023 and taking on the role of Director of Volunteers in 2024. Although we didn’t have a show last year, I spent that time learning, planning, and preparing to make the air show volunteer experience a fun and rewarding time for everyone involved. I’m planning to take everything I had learned last year and build on it to make this year’s volunteer experience even better. The thing I love most about air shows is the shared awe and enjoyment of aviation. Hearing the cheers of the crowd and feeling the rumble in your chest as a jet speeds over our heads is such an incredible\nexperience.\nJared Halstead\nDirector of Sponsorships\nJared Halstead joined the Florida International Air Show team in 2024 as the Hotels and Gyms Coordinator in the Aviation Operations Department. In January 2025, he was appointed to the Board of Directors to lead sponsorship efforts.
