      "text": "Historical Events\nHistory is the backbone of St. Augustine and is ever present in many of the local events. Living history takes visitors back in time to imagine what life was like in the colonial days of St. Augustine. Historic re-enactments take place often to re-create the significant events in St. Augustine’s past. Annual re-enactments like the Founder’s Day event in St. Augustine or the Spanish Colonial Grand Muster both commemorate notable events during the Spanish colonial period. It is the history in St. Augustine that ties each visitor and resident together and is common in all of us since St. Augustine’s successful port helped shape the country.\nSponsored Partners\nHistorical Events\nDate\nRegion\n- Any -\nAnastasia Island\nBartram & CR 210\nCrescent Beach\nElkton\nFruit Cove\nHastings\nHistoric Downtown\nLincolnville\nNorth City\nPonce de Leon Blvd\nPonte Vedra\nPonte Vedra Beach\nSR 16 to I-95\nSouth St. Augustine\nSt. Augustine Beach\nUptown\nUS1 North\nVilano Beach\nWest St. Augustine\nWorld Golf Area\nRegions\nListings\n30\n60\n90\n120\nFriday, September 5th, 2025\nCelebrate at Ximenez-Fatio House\nSelect Days, Sep. 5, 2025 -
