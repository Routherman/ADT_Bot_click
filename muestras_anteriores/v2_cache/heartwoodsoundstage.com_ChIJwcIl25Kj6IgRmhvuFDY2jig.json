      "text": "About Heartwood Soundstage\nHeartwood Soundstage is a state-of-the-art music venue & production studio in Gainesville, Florida.\nHeartwood is the product of the collective vision of founders Bob McPeek, Dave Melosh, Hoch Shitama, and Paul Pavelka. It is also the marriage of two recording studios, Mirror Image and Medusa, that played pivotal roles in the Gainesville music scene for forty years. Bob and Paul founded Mirror Image Recording Studios in 1977. Medusa was begun by Dave Melosh, originally as an audio production facility, but branching into video production soon thereafter. Built on the site of Mirror Image (and expanded into neighboring properties), Heartwood is the seventhâand by far the most ambitiousâiteration of the original 1977 studio.",
