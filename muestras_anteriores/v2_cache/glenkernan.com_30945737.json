Set in a gently elevated setting and favored by cooling breezes from the nearby Intracoastal Waterway, the Club brings together spirits and personalities that enjoy the finest in relaxed exclusivity.\nOnly minutes from the center of Jacksonville and Jacksonville Beach, the Club is an environmental sanctuary. Club members share its 250+ acres with a wide variety of wildlife, including eagles, osprey, foxes, gopher tortoises and the occasional bull gator.\nMembership at Glen Kernan Club is a highly personal experience, and anticipation of each member’s preferences is the standard. Facilities are impeccably maintained and continuously upgraded.\nThe new Glen Kernan Club was created for its members, a limited number of individuals who appreciate the traditions of the game of golf and who enjoy each other’s company.\nPass through the Club gates and wind your way through an allée of native oaks to arrive at the Main House, a perfectly proportioned and updated Clubhouse that is non-traditional in all the right ways.\nThe 18-hole championship course was re-designed and reimagined by noted golf course architect Jim Furyk.
