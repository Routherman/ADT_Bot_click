      "text": "About Us\nWAVES AT PINEAPPLE COVE\nWELCOME TO\nWaves at Pineapple Cove\nIt all began with Pineapple Cove Academy Early Learning facility, where our students experienced excellence in early education at the preschool level. From there, we grew thanks to the overwhelming community and family support to establish Pineapple Cove Classical Academy, Brevard County’s only K-12 Classical Charter School network.\nSince 2006, the Pineapple Cove network of schools has offered parents a unique and time-honored approach to education while creating an environment where students have a voice and faculty and staff know each of their names. With a homey and welcoming environment for all, regardless of socio-economic status, Pineapple Cove relies on its active family interaction from preschool to graduation and beyond.\nAbout Us\nWAVES AT PINEAPPLE COVE\nIn 2023, a new chapter begins – Waves at Pineapple Cove. This innovative development will provide the community of Palm Bay with recreational activities, including water sports, swimming lessons, a children’s splash pad, and fitness classes, all within the welcoming setting of the Pineapple Cove Classical Academy’s Palm Bay Campus. We are excited to use this new extension of Pineapple Cove to bring the community together –with swimming and play! Not only will community members have the opportunity to enjoy a safe and accessible space to escape the Florida summer, but we hope to allow local schools to compete in a new and conveniently located Olympic-size pool in central Brevard.\nFrom the top down, the staff and faculty within the Pineapple Cove family are committed to helping our communities find a place to come together, relax, and have fun. This is why Waves at Pineapple Cove swimming facility is so important to us. We believe in “Giving Back More Than We Take,” so we want to offer a warm and welcoming swimming option that caters to both adults and children alike to Palm Bay and Brevard County residents.\nContact us Now\nDonate Today\nWAVES AT PINEAPPLE COVE\nThe team at Waves at Pineapple Cove is working hard to make our dream of creating a welcoming and safe aquatic recreation area for the residents of Brevard County a reality. We can only do it with the generous individuals and businesses who make up our amazing Space Coast community. Your tax-deductible donation will finance the construction and upkeep of our beautiful and accessible planned project. So please, donate today and help us make waves!\nDonate Now",
