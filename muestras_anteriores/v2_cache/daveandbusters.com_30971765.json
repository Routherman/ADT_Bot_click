A guests’ position on the Leaderboard will be indicated by their selected Play ID.\nWhat is a Play ID? How do I get one?\nA Play ID is unique identifier for guests at D&B that allows you to participate in Leaderboard challenges.  Play IDs can be obtained at a kiosk at your local D&B. In addition, you must be 13 years of age or older and join the D&B Rewards program to select a Play ID.\nWhen does the Challenge take place?\nThis Leaderboard Challenge runs June 11th through September 1st.\nHow do I participate in the challenge?\nYou must be a member of the D&B Rewards program AND have a Play ID. Both can be obtained at your local D&B store at the kiosk. Follow the prompts to opt-in and head to any of the 5 games included in the challenge. If you secure a first-place win or jackpot, you’ve earned your spot on the Winning on All Cylinders Leaderboard.\nHow do I win prizes? Can I win more than once?\nThere are multiple ways to win in the Winning on All Cylinders Leaderboard Challenge. Every first place win or jackpot gets you a position on the Leaderboard AND an entry into the End of Summer Sweepstakes.\nEvery month, the Play ID with the top spot – 1st place – for each game at the store level will receive a prize. The local Leaderboards will be reset monthly.\nAt the end of the Leaderboard Challenge (Sept. 1) the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place Play ID winners that have accumulated the most wins by game across all stores for the duration of the summer will receive prizes. The scoring is based on a cumulative total of wins/jackpots across June, July, and August.\nNational (end of summer) Sweepstakes Winner via random drawing. Guests can earn up to 2 entries per day; equaling a total of 25 entries across the summer program. Entry into sweepstakes can also be obtained through mail-in (no purchase required).\nView All FAQs",
