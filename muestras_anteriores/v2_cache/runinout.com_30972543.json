If you're looking to go out, RUNIN Out can be your personal digital tour guide.\nOur website and mobile web app currently features over 5,000 venues and display over 10,000 dishes covering an area from Fredericksburg, VA to Baltimore, MD -- and everywhere in between.\nQ: How do I use RUNIN Out\nSearch Box\nRUNIN Out employs the same type of faceted search technology that E-Commerce sites like Zappos and Amazon uses.\nSimply type whatever you want:  Steak, Sirloin, Meat, Rare, even your neighborhood or Zip Code, and RUNIN Out will find the exact dish that you are looking for. Want to search for multiple criteria? Simply type a \"+\" sign and our custom engine will search specifically for these features. Here's a short\nvideo tutorial\n:\nRUNIN Out is constantly compiling an expanding database of restaurant and dishes.  We also offer cutting-edge faceted search capability.  This means that you can select and filter specific criteria within multiple categories.\nEG: Under the category, Cuisine, you select: Chinese, French and Lebanese.  Under the Neighborhood criteria, you select: Adams Morgan, Falls Church and Rockville.  Under the Taste criteria you select: Spicy, Baked and Sour.  Under the Food Mood criteria, you select: Romantic, Adventurous, Cultural. The list goes on to include Price, Rating, Food Type, Ingredients, Foodies Then using these facets and constraints, we will provide you with all the results that best match the criteria.\nThe results are provided based on reviews and popularity.  When you search seafood, the dishes that are most popular will show up first. When you search by neighborhood, the restaurants and stores that are the most popular will show up first.  Ever wonder what the most popular dish at a restaurant or neighborhood is?Check it out..\nOther Ways to Search on RUNINOut:\nMenu Bar\nYou can also use the Menu bar and drill down to your selection for Cuisine, Goodies, Food Mood and Neighborhood.  The Food Mood term is designed to pique your creative, more adventurous spirit -- we are open to suggestions on how we can even make this work better for you.\nOn Site Navigation:\nEach selection displays several Food Tags:\nRestaurants:\nCuisine, Food Type, Neighborhood, Food Mood, Date\nDish:\nCuisine, Food Type, Ingredients. By clicking on any of these Food Tags, you are provided a display of other restaurants and/or dishes that share the same features.\nAt the Restaurant or Venue\nRUNIN Out is designed  for user interaction at the restaurant. Many restaurants are provided with a QR code that links directly to their restaurant page.  Or you can just easily search for the name of the restaurant where you are provided an interactive view of all the featured dishes.\nThen just pare down your choices by adding keywords: Eg: Chicken, Appetizer, Spicy, etc. Once you find the dish that interests you, click on it to read more about it such as a user review, rating, Foodie and specific ingredients.\nIf you are not completly satisfied, click on the \"You Might Also Like\" link which will take you to more choices from that particular restaurant that may work better.\nQ: How does RUNIN Out remember user’s preferences.\nThis is completely up to you.  You create your own profile for cuisines, dishes, restaurant preferences and ingredients. If you like a particular dish or venue, simply click on the Heart Icon to save it to your \"Craves.\"  Moreover, your profile is further  enhanced through reviews, ratings and social media interaction, ie. Facebook Likes, Pinterest, Twitter, Google +\nThe more information our users provide, the mor specialized we become.   Whether you are going out with friends, family, colleagues or even on a date RUNIN Out will exhaust all resources to find the perfect dish for you\nQ: How will this info help the user?\nThe more we know YOU, the better we can provide customized recommendations to YOU, not just in the Washington, DC area but also in other cities when we expand.  Say you visit Kansas City on a business trip, RUNIN Out will transfer your foodie profile to that city and make customized recommendations based on your existing preferences.\nQ: What else do you provide besides Dining Out information?\nRUNIN Out also features musuems, theaters, parks, memorials, and selected retail\nQ: Should RUNIN Out only be used when you are getting ready to dine out?\nWe hope not. RUNIN Out is a social media site, designed for the customer.   Customers are expected to post pictures, write reviews, build their profile and share their experiences with others just like you would with other social media sites like Yelp or Foodspotting.\nQ: Why else would should consumers use RUNINOut\nPlanning a date\nFriends coming from out of town\nPlanning group dinner\nBirthday, Anniversary\nHH event after work\nVisiting DC\nHotel Concierges\nQ: Will restaurants have access to their own restaurant page?\nYes, with a premium account restaurants will be given full access to their page and can control which dishes to showcase.  Restaurants can also update their pricing and post coupons and discounts.  Restaurants however will not be able to remove or edit reviews.\nQ: Why else would restaurants use RUNINOut\nMarket Analysis before opening business\nBrand Analysis before purchasing goods\nDemographic Analysis before planning event\nWeb Analysis before designing website\nQ: Where do you get your photos?\nThree primary sources: from the Restaurant or retail, from bloggers and from wonderful people like you. And of course, we all enjoy going out, too.\nQ: Isn’t it bias if the restaurants or retail provide you with photos?\nWe are an online menu – our goal is to display pictures of the top dishes, drinks and other items so that the user can be afforded comprehensive and user-friendly display.\nWe encourage pictures from customers also and believe they provide a diverse mix of pictures and character to our display.\nQ: Why should users post pictures on your site?\nPosting pictures on RUNIN Out will enhance the user’s profile so that we get to know what your favorite dishes, cusines and ingredients are.\nQ: Do you compete with Google, Bing and Yahoo?  Not at all. RUNINOut is a vertical search engine that only slices one piece of the pie.  If you are a Wal-Mart shopper you don't go there all the time. If you're purchasing tools you may go to a hardware store.  In a similar vein, Google will provide you with the necessary results, but ours is more specialized.\nQ: How do you determine which pictures will be displayed on your homepage?\nOur goal is to serve as your online, interactive menu and to provide a comprehensive, seasonal display of the top dishes.\nAll pictures will be displayed, but the top dishes by rating and season will be featured more prominently.  EG: During Valentine’s Day, top romantic dishes will be more prominently displayed.\nPictures that are not featured prominently on the landing page will still be featured prominently in the individual users’ page to provide an interactive display of each user’s favorite dishes.\nQ: How do you get feedback about dishes and different cuisines?\nFrom user’s reviews, ratings, customer traffic and social media shares (Facebook, Twitter and Google +)\nQ: How are you different from Yelp\nWe are a search engine not a restaurant review site. Imagine the internet been a big, juicy birthday cake.  RUNINOut would only be a small slice of that cake.  However, if you were to cut through the cake, you will see that while Google and Yelp are more broad, RUNINOut is more deep.  Cuz it’s not just about finding restaurants based on cuisine and neighborhood. Here you’re looking for a specific dish, the ingredients in that dish, how that dish tastes and how the restaurant appeals to your preferences.\nQ: How do you plan to get the word out?\nWonderful people like you will tell all your friends about us.\nRestaurants will also encourage their customers to visit their restaurant pages.  Also restaurants will be provided a QR code so customers can quickly access the restaurant page.\nBecause RUNIN Out is a social media site where users post pictures and reviews and share their experiences -- word of mouth is the greatest tool.\nRUNINOut also hosts weekly and biweekly food tasting events throughout the DMV area. Event schedule is advertised on our\nQ: Why is RUNIN Out so different?\nRUNIN Out believes in user experience.  We have created the Food Mood category and believe that certain restaurants and dishes will work better for depending on your particular mood or occasion.  Many of our pictures include the foodies actually enjoying their meal -- we believe in personalization.\nSpeaking of occasion, RUNIN Out also believes in romance and have categorized restaurants based on specific dates (Romantic, Platonic, Pre-Theater, First, etc).\nQ: Can I request for a particular restaurant to be added?\nAbsolutely, send your request to\nchito@runinout.com\nQ: Where did you get the name?\nThe name RUNIN Out started as a running blog. Chito had just retired from the Navy and found himself at an important juncture in life. He started running and blogging, but before long realized that he enjoyed running mostly because he got to meet different people and learn from their life experiences.\nIt was at this time that the acronym RUNIN was formed.\nRUNIN Out is\nResearching\nyour preferences and priorities\nIt means using Google, Social Media, reading the news and fully understanding your topic.\nRUNIN Out is\nUnderstanding\nyour choices across all Neighborhoods and Cuisines, even dishes you would never consider eating. It also means understanding the other persons point of view and as much as I reasonably can about a topic.  I love to learn background\nRUNN Out is\nNegotiating\nyour options to include other People, preferences, prices and Personality.\nI never just say No. I ask Why\"  I ask a ton of relevant questions and I try to find a common ground that is Win Win\nRUNIN Out is\nInnovating\n-- leveraging the social network to make the smartest decision that would make your Mother proud.\nAlways try to use the innovative technology available to me (within budget and reach).  I believe in tapping all resources: Email, Blogs, FB, Twitter, Instagram, Phone, text, in person meeting  - so that we can come together and decide.\nRUNIN Out is\nNetworking -\n- sharing your ideas with others so that they can gain insight from your experiences. Then starting all over again...\nN also stands for Navigating - Don't wallow in indecision. After doing all of the above, I decide, realizing it may not be the best decision but it's the best I can make at this time\nQ: Where did the project start?\nAs a class project in an Entrpreneur class at George Washington University, School of Business.  Our classes in Marketing,  Finance, and Business Law have greatly contributed to the development of our business plan.\nruninoutonline\nruninoutonline",
