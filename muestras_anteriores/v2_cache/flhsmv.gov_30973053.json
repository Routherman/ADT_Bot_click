Cone, member of the Executive Board of the Department of Public Safety, made a motion to establish the Florida Highway Patrol. Under the direction of Director Reid and (then) Captain Kirkman, the first training academy was held in Bradenton with 40 students. This class graduated 32 members and by the end of 1940 (the first full year of operation), FHP had 59 patrolmen. In that first year, they patrolled 1,938,564 miles of roadway and investigated 1,000 crashes. Today we patrol over 43,200,000 miles and investigate over 176,000 crashes annually. Florida had less than two million residents in 1939, while today we have over 23 million. Additionally, Florida has an estimated 140 million visitors to our state each year.\nThe FHP strives to achieve our core values of courtesy, service and protection. It is our job to help ensure the safety and welfare of millions of Florida’s residents and visitors each day.\nThe Florida Highway Patrol is authorized for 1,982 sworn positions and 503 non-sworn positions for a total of 2,485 full time employees. The majority of those sworn positions are assigned to Patrol Operations.\nIn addition to Patrol Operations, the Florida Highway Patrol has many specialized areas. The Office of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement conducts data driven enforcement and educational programs to improve the safety of commercial motor vehicles. The Criminal Interdiction Unit consists of specially trained troopers that are strategically assigned throughout the state in order to interdict criminal activity.

As of July 1, 2022, pursuant to s. 394.463(2)(a) or s. 397.6772(1)(a), a receiving facility, hospital, or licensed detoxification or addictions receiving facility has access to your emergency contact information for the sole purpose of notifying those you have listed of your whereabouts.\nWill my information be used for any other purpose?\nNo. This information is only used to notify the contacts that you designate in the event of an emergency.\nWhy was this system developed?\nThe system was first developed in Florida because there was no emergency contact program in place to quickly notify loved ones in the event of an emergency. ECI was initiated by Christine Olson in loving memory of her daughter Tiffiany because she was involved in a fatal crash and it was over 6 hours before Christine was notified. Read more about the history below.\nSpread the ECI Message: Community Resource Toolkit\nECI\nSample Social Media Posts\nECI\nLogo\nECI\nPoster\nECI\nBrochure\nTo Inform Families First\nwebsite\nRegister now at\nMyDMVPortal.flhsmv.gov\nHistory\nOn December 7, 2005, the life of Christine Olson was changed forever. Christine’s daughter Tiffiany Olson was involved in a traffic crash on U.S. 19\nin Manatee County, Florida. Tiffiany received fatal injuries when the motorcycle she was a passenger on collided with another vehicle.\nMs. Olson was not notified of Tiffiany’s passing for several hours and was not able to say her last goodbyes. Since that day, Ms. Olson, with the assistance of State Representative Bill Galvano from Bradenton District 68, began pushing for emergency information to be added to a person’s driver’s license or identification card.\nSince the information could not be printed directly on a license, Ms. Olson and Rep. Galvano contacted the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) and took the next best route-to have the information included in the D.A.V.I.D. (Driver And Vehicle Information Database) system which is a secured database used by most law enforcement agencies in the State of Florida.\nMs. Olson and her family and FLHSMV are urging all licensed drivers in the State of Florida to input their information so families can be contacted more quickly when a family member is seriously injured or killed in a traffic crash.\nMs. Olson and her family have worked tirelessly to make emergency information readily available for law enforcement and her efforts have paid off so far.

As of July 1, 2022, pursuant to s. 394.463(2)(a) or s. 397.6772(1)(a), a receiving facility, hospital, or licensed detoxification or addictions receiving facility has access to your emergency contact information for the sole purpose of notifying those you have listed of your whereabouts.\nWill my information be used for any other purpose?\nNo. This information is only used to notify the contacts that you designate in the event of an emergency.\nWhy was this system developed?\nThe system was first developed in Florida because there was no emergency contact program in place to quickly notify loved ones in the event of an emergency. ECI was initiated by Christine Olson in loving memory of her daughter Tiffiany because she was involved in a fatal crash and it was over 6 hours before Christine was notified.

Christine’s daughter Tiffiany Olson was involved in a traffic crash on U.S. 19\nin Manatee County, Florida. Tiffiany received fatal injuries when the motorcycle she was a passenger on collided with another vehicle.\nMs. Olson was not notified of Tiffiany’s passing for several hours and was not able to say her last goodbyes. Since that day, Ms. Olson, with the assistance of State Representative Bill Galvano from Bradenton District 68, began pushing for emergency information to be added to a person’s driver’s license or identification card.\nSince the information could not be printed directly on a license, Ms. Olson and Rep. Galvano contacted the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) and took the next best route-to have the information included in the D.A.V.I.D. (Driver And Vehicle Information Database) system which is a secured database used by most law enforcement agencies in the State of Florida.\nMs. Olson and her family and FLHSMV are urging all licensed drivers in the State of Florida to input their information so families can be contacted more quickly when a family member is seriously injured or killed in a traffic crash.\nMs. Olson and her family have worked tirelessly to make emergency information readily available for law enforcement and her efforts have paid off so far.

The crash entry has the same retention as an associated guilty disposition.\nAll\nopen suspensions, revocations, cancellations, disqualifications of the driving privilege.\nSuspensions, revocations, cancellations, and disqualifications cleared within 3 or 7 years of the date the record is run, unless the retention is met, and the entry has purged.\nD-6 suspensions (failure to comply) once cleared, remain on the record 1 year from the reinstatement date and are then converted to a correspondence entry for 2 more years. Once this D6 entry converts to a correspondence entry it\ndoes not\nappear on 3- or 7-year driver records (transcripts).\nWhat is on the complete driver record?\nDriver license/ID card issuances, exams passed and driver education.\nAll\nguilty dispositions and adjudication withheld dispositions of traffic violations that appear on the entire record, unless the retention is met, and the entry has purged.\nCrash entries, when a traffic citation was issued as a direct result of the crash. The crash entry has the same retention as an associated guilty disposition.\nAll\nopen or closed suspensions, revocations, cancellations, disqualifications that appear on the complete driver history, unless the retention is met, and the entry has purged.\nD-6 suspensions (failure to comply) once cleared, remain on the record 1 year from the reinstatement date and are then converted to a correspondence entry for 2 more years. This correspondence entry\ndoes\nappear on a complete record, unless the retention is met, and the entry has purged.\nCorrespondence entry indicating adjudication withheld-clerk of court (the person made school election when not eligible or made the election but did not complete the course).\nDepartment approved correspondence.\nWhat is adjudication withheld?\nA person elected to complete a driver improvement school and provided proof of completion to the court in lieu of receiving points for a traffic violation.\nA person elected to enter a plea of nolo contendere and provided proof of compliance for a violation.\nThe judge or traffic magistrate withheld adjudication for a violation.\nHow many times can I elect to complete driver improvement school in lieu of receiving points?\nEffective July 1, 2024, Florida Statute 318.14(9), provides that a person may make no more than eight traffic school elections within their lifetime and once in a twelve-month period. This is for Florida violations only and the election is made through the Florida court in the county in which the person received the citation.\nFlorida commercial driver license holders are not eligible to elect completion of a driver improvement school to avoid assessment of points for traffic citations, regardless of whether the violation was committed in a commercial motor vehicle.\nWhy is personal information in the record blocked?\nThe Driver Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) keeps your personal information private by limiting who has access to the information. DPPA is designed to limit public access to your social security number, driver license or ID card number, name, and address. Personal information protected by DPPA does not include date of birth, driving violations, and driver status.\nThe department automatically blocks the personal information in your motor vehicle and driver license records.\nFlorida Statute 119 (public records) allows for certain individuals in sworn or high-risk positions (ex: law enforcement officers, judges, and other public officials) to have their address and date of birth blocked, making this information exempt from DPPA upon request using\nform 96020\n.\nHow long do entries stay on the record?\nCitation dispositions of guilty – Most non-moving/moving violations have a 3- to 5-year retention; for more serious violations the retention periods vary (10 years, 15 years, etc.) and depend on the severity of the violation.\nCitation dispositions of adjudication withheld clerk of court (called school elections) are retained for 75 years with only allowed up to 5 in a lifetime) and for compliances, 75 years (only allowed up to 3 in a lifetime).

Christine’s daughter Tiffiany Olson was involved in a traffic crash on U.S. 19\nin Manatee County, Florida. Tiffiany received fatal injuries when the motorcycle she was a passenger on collided with another vehicle.\nMs. Olson was not notified of Tiffiany’s passing for several hours and was not able to say her last goodbyes. Since that day, Ms. Olson, with the assistance of State Representative Bill Galvano from Bradenton District 68, began pushing for emergency information to be added to a person’s driver’s license or identification card.\nSince the information could not be printed directly on a license, Ms. Olson and Rep. Galvano contacted the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) and took the next best route-to have the information included in the D.A.V.I.D. (Driver And Vehicle Information Database) system which is a secured database used by most law enforcement agencies in the State of Florida.\nMs. Olson and her family and FLHSMV are urging all licensed drivers in the State of Florida to input their information so families can be contacted more quickly when a family member is seriously injured or killed in a traffic crash.\nMs. Olson and her family have worked tirelessly to make emergency information readily available for law enforcement and her efforts have paid off so far.
