But none have come close to giving us the comfort, professionalism and peace of mind as Winter Park Paws. We’ve been consistent weekly customers of Winter Park paws for the past 6 months. In that time, Winter Park Paws has watched and cared for our 3 dogs in the best way. We even took a few vacations and tried their boarding service as well. Winter Park Paws gave us daily updates for both daycare and boarding. Winter Park Paws took many photos of our pups and are very active on their Instagram which was great to discover! We could always check on our dogs and see how they were doing. They always have the biggest smiles on their faces when they are in the care of Winter Park Paws. You can tell all the employees are well trained and they’ve all loved our dogs fully & work very hard to give the best service possible. We were also happy to find out there was an onboarding evaluation before being able to be clients in their facility. Winter Park Paws cares that all the dogs that interact are in a safe and positive environment. Winter Park Paws cares about the well being of their client’s animals above all else.
