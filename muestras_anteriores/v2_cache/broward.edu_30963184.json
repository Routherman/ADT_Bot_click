The College is designated as a Military Friendly institution that offers a variety of programs to Veterans, in-service personnel, and dependents of deceased or disabled Veterans.\nHave Questions?\nWe are here to help!\nCONTACT US\nCertification Request Forms\nVETERAN CERTIFICATION REQUEST FORMS\nWe begin processing certifications no less than 45 days before the semester begins. As a Veteran or Veteran dependent, you are eligible for Veterans' Preference (early registration) so you can choose your classes before we are able to certify your enrollment.\nThe VA allows benefit recipients to choose which classes they wish to have certified. VA beneficiaries now have a requirement to specify the course IDs for all classes they wish to have certified. You can now choose to only have a portion of your classes certified to save some of your benefits for a later date.\nYou will be required to upload a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility with your certification request. Veterans receiving Chapter 31 (VR&E) benefits are required to enter a valid Authorization/PO number.\nFall 2025:\nVeteran Benefit Certification - Fall 2025\nVeteran Benefit Certification Schedule Change - Fall 2025\nFall Flight Students with ATF Flight Courses ONLY (Complete BOTH forms):\nVA Aviation Plan\nVeteran Benefit AVIATION Certification - Fall 2025\nSpring 2026:\nRegistration for the Spring 2026 semester is Monday, July 7, 2025 for continuing student Veterans. New students registration is Monday, August 25, 2025. Veteran Certification for this semester will not begin until November 1, 2025.\nTh\ne VA has instituted an Enrollment Verification process where Veterans using Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) and Dependents using DEA (Chapter 35) MUST verify their enrollment each month before they will receive their MHA payment or stipend. The VA will send you a text or email each month asking if you are still enrolled in your classes prior to your MHA payment being processed.\nIf you have not already opted into receiving text messages or if you are not sure your current phone number is on file with the VA, you will need to contact them as soon as possible. Call 888-442-4551 (888-GI-BILL-1) and choose the option to speak with someone and they can confirm your information.\nIf you change your phone number, contact the VA right away to update your information.\nCertification requests should be submitted 10 business days prior to start of each semester to ensure timely payments.\nPlease be advised that your courses must be required for your program of study. It is strongly advised you speak with an Academic Advisor to ensure any courses you are registered for are applicable to avoid delays in your enrollment certification being processed.\nAnyone using VA benefits must complete an electronic certification request form for VA Benefits to be processed at Broward College. This certification request process allows Veterans to upload all necessary documents, from anywhere using the Broward College website. The certification request must be completed\neach term\nfor benefits to be certified with the VA.\nThe certification request form can only be submitted\nonce per term\n. If there is any change in your enrollment after your initial certification request has been submitted, please submit a ‘Veteran Benefit Certification Schedule Change’ form.\nPlease review the charts below as a guide to help you maximize your MHA each semester. You must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 credits during the Fall and Spring terms, and 8-9 credits during the Summer term to be eligible for full-time enrollment.\nThis applies to VA benefits only\n. If you are eligible for the Pell Grant, you would still need to be enrolled in 12 credits to be considered for full-time Pell.\nFall and Spring Semesters Best Options\nOption 1\nOption 2\nOption 3\n12 credits Session 1\n6 credits Session 1\nAND\n3 credits Session 2\nAND\n3 credits Session 4\n6 credits Session 2\nAND\n6 credits Session 4\nOne class must be on campus from the beginning to the end of the semester to receive MHA at the on-campus rate. Taking all online courses will result in MHA paid at the online-only rate.\nSummer Semester Best Options\nOption 1\nOption 2\nOption 3\n8 credits Session 1\n3 credits Session 1\nAND\n3 credits Session 2\nAND\n3 credits Session 3\n4 credits Session 2\nAND\n4 credits Session 3\nThe online rate can be found on the\nGI Bill® Comparison Tool\n.\nWHAT IF I GET ACTIVATED?\nBroward College recognizes and appreciates the important contributions made by Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard members. In order to accommodate these students and their dependents, College Policy provides direction to faculty and staff on offering these students the following options to accommodate UNEXPECTED training/drill, deployment, or change-of-station orders during the term:\n1. For any training/drill, deployment, or change-of-station orders: Students will attempt to decide with instructors to maintain and/or make up class work as needed and to assign grades as appropriate (including incompletes, to be made up later). Registration for those courses, in which instructors accommodate the absence will remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees will be assessed in full for those courses. Service members should provide instructors with maximum notice of absences, providing copies of training/drill, deployment, and/or change-of-station directives from the Military, Reserve, or National Guard.\n2. Instructors must accommodate absences of up to two weeks in duration (or equivalent in Summer) in accordance with paragraph one.\n3. When unable to make satisfactory arrangements with all instructors: Courses will be dropped and the tuition and mandatory fees for those courses will be rescinded.\n4. When unable to decide with any instructors for unexpected orders requiring longer than a two-week absence: The student’s entire registration for that semester will be withdrawn or canceled and 100% of the tuition and mandatory fees will be rescinded.\n5. In order to have your tuition rescinded, you will need to submit an\nAcademic Standards Petition form\n.\nIf you still have questions, please contact us via email:\nveterans@broward.edu\nMake sure you include your name, student ID, your phone number, with your question and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\nIf you are able to continue with your coursework while on Active Duty, you must notify the VA Education line as soon as possible at 888-442-4551. You cannot be paid BAH for Active Duty and Education benefits at the same time and you will receive a Debt Letter to pay back any MHA funds that you received while on Active Duty.\nServices Offered\nAPPLY FOR VETERAN BENEFITS\nIf you are a Veteran planning to use VA benefits while attending school, please apply online through the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n, if you are eligible for one of the following benefits:\nChapter 33 - Post 9/11\nChapter 30 - Montgomery GI Bill® Active Duty (MGIB-AD)\nChapter 1606 - Montgomery GI Bill® Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR\nChapter 35 - Dependents Education Allowance\nVeterans applying for Chapter 31 - Veteran Readiness & Employment (formerly known as VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment) or applying to transition from Chapter 33 to Chapter 31,\nsee steps to apply\n.\nVETERANS FEE WAIVERS\nOut-of-State Tuition Waiver for Veterans & Dependents\nIn accordance with 38 United States Code § 3679(c), and effective July 1, 2015,\nFlorida Statute 1009.26(13)\nwas established to provide out-of-state tuition and fee waivers to veterans and eligible dependents who attend Florida public, post-secondary institutions and who physically reside within the state of Florida.

This coverage will be removed after the date when the first payment from the VA is scheduled to be received by the student and a receivable balance will be created, which needs to be paid by the student. No temporary coverage will be needed if the student has been awarded Financial Aid or other aid that covers their tuition balance.\nTuition and fees\nfor Chapter 33 benefits are reported to the VA using the VA's web-based system, Enrollment Manager.

Motwani Family Academy of Hospitality and Tourism Management in memory of Motwani family patriarch, Ramesh \"Bob\" Motwani, who passed away 25 years ago.\n\"Broward College is blessed to receive this gift, a gift that will make such a difference in the lives of others, the students who will rise up in the hospitality and tourism industries as a result of the generosity of the Motwani family,\" said Broward College President Gregory Adam Haile, Esq. at the announcement event. \"We have the privilege of recognizing this family, who had a dream for our community, found success in achieving it, and who are giving back.\"\nRamola Motwani pointed out that the \"R\" in the R. Motwani Family Academy stands for both Ramesh and Ramola and represents their common dream, noting \"one initial, one dream, one vision.\"\n\"We celebrate my late husband, Bob Motwani, and his vision for the future of hospitality and tourism in South Florida with the establishment of the R. Motwani Family Academy,\" said Ramola Motwani, chairwoman of Merrimac Ventures, the company she and Bob founded together. \"As a family, we share my husband's dream and continue to be committed to growing, shaping and enhancing our industry.  Partnering with Broward College to develop future leaders who will contribute to this burgeoning industry is one path to accomplishing this goal.\"\nIn addition to the launch of the R. Motwani Family Academy, the Motwani family committed to hosting an annual signature fundraising event for five years to secure additional resources for the Academy.  The first gala event will take place on November 7 at the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach.  For more information, visit\nhttps://giving.broward.edu/motwani-academy-gala\n.\nPlus, the family is using their extensive relationships in the community to raise scholarship funds earmarked for Academy students. They also have committed to using their relationships with industry leaders to create internships for students within multiple sectors of the tourism and hospitality industry, ranging from cruise lines and casinos to hotels and entertainment.  In addition, to deepen the educational experience for students, they plan to bring in national and international speakers and develop practical, hands-on field trip opportunities.\nRamola Motwani's objective is to connect students participating in 15 public high school hospitality programs, which she has championed for 12 years, to Broward College's R. Motwani Family Academy.\nMotwani Family Academy at Broward College:\nStudents will be able to secure a position in the industry upon receiving their certification or degree or will continue on to earn bachelor's and/or master's degrees in hospitality, tourism or related fields.  In fact, students who earn their associates degrees at the Academy may seamlessly transfer into Florida International University's Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management due to an articulation agreement with Broward College.  In all cases, Academy graduates will have opportunities for success while accelerating the growth of this linchpin industry.\n\"Bringing up these future leaders will positively impact our community for the long term,\" said Motwani. \"Our South Florida economy hinges on hospitality and tourism, and creating stronger leaders will inevitably create a more robust industry.\"\nAbout Merrimac Ventures:\nMerrimac Ventures is a real estate investment and development firm focused on prime resort and mixed-use development with significant investment in multi-family residential, condominiums, retail and office.  Partners in Merrimac Ventures currently are involved in more than $3 billion in projects, including Miami WorldCenter, the Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences Fort Lauderdale, The Gale Boutique Hotel and Residences, Paramount Fort Lauderdale Beach, Broadstone Oceanside in Pompano Beach and the Flagler Village Hotel, among others.\nMerrimac Ventures was founded in the late 1970s by Bob and Ramola Motwani as an import/export business in St. Charles, Missouri. In the mid-1980s, Merrimac Ventures expanded into the hotel business by purchasing hotels along Fort Lauderdale's famed A1A strip. With the elimination of Spring Break in the late 1980s, most hotel owners in the area either suffered foreclosure or were forced to leave; however, Bob and Ramola continued to acquire properties with a common vision of redeveloping and transforming the Fort Lauderdale Beach into a world-class resort destination, a vision also shared by the local community and government at the time.\nWith Bob's passing in 1994, Ramola continued to pursue that shared vision with a tireless determination. Under her guidance, Merrimac Ventures has continued to expand its footprint throughout the United States and India.  In 2004, Ramola brought in her eldest son Nitin Motwani, who was working with Goldman Sachs at the time, to help expand the business and oversee the day-to-day operations. In 2006, her younger son Dev Motwani left his job with Credit Suisse to work with Merrimac Ventures, while Nitin focused full-time on the firm's Miami WorldCenter project. Today, Ramola serves as chairwoman of the firm, responsible for setting its long-term goals and vision. Dev, president and CEO of the company, oversees the day-to-day operations and the investments in which the firm acts as the principal. He also has served on the Board of the Broward College Foundation since 2015. Nitin is a principal of the firm as well as managing partner of Miami WorldCenter.\nAbout the R. Motwani Family Academy of Hospitality and Tourism Management:\nThe Motwani family will offer their expertise to build upon the established hospitality and tourism program at Broward College.  The program currently offers three certificate programs and three associate degree programs in the restaurant, hospitality and tourism management fields.  Programs develop the knowledge and skills that underpin an array of professions ranging from hotel management and food service to hospitality law and financial management. Classes are taught by faculty who provide real-world experience and teach using cutting-edge tools and techniques.\nAbout the Broward College Foundation:\nThe Broward College Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and the officially designated means of making private, charitable contributions to Broward College.  Its purpose is to change lives through education by providing community awareness, advocacy and funding to the College.  Members of the Foundation's volunteer board of directors work closely with the College's Office of Advancement to raise money to support scholarships, academic programs and learning facility enhancements. They believe every person who is determined to change their life through the pursuit of higher education should be afforded that opportunity.  For more information, visit\nwww.broward.edu/foundation\nor call 954-201-7414.\nABOUT BROWARD COLLEGE\n: Serving more than 51,000 students annually, Broward College provides students with certificate programs, two-year university-transfer degrees, two-year career degrees, and baccalaureate degrees in selected programs. The College’s mission is to provide high-quality educational programs and services that are affordable and accessible to our community of learners. Together, we are working to make Broward College the number one destination for academic excellence.

Today, Ramola serves as chairwoman of the firm, responsible for setting its long-term goals and vision. Dev, president and CEO of the company, oversees the day-to-day operations and the investments in which the firm acts as the principal. He also has served on the Board of the Broward College Foundation since 2015. Nitin is a principal of the firm as well as managing partner of Miami WorldCenter.\nAbout the R.
