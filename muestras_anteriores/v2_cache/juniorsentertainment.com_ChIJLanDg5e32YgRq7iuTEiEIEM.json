Juniors Entertainment was the perfect fit for our 4/12/2025 wedding in Palm Beach, FL. From the ceremony with the Strings Ensembles and Singers, to the Jazz Band for the cocktail hour, and to The Ice Breakers Band for the Reception and DJ for the After-party - everything was perfect. My family and friends were amazed with all; the music Junior specially tailored for us. The Ceremony music was truly magical, and the Jazz vibe before the Reception set the pace for the party. The Ice Breakers had great enthusiasm and got the guests excited to dance on the dancefloor at all times. The Band Gowns and Tuxedo Jackets were a superb touch of class and glamour. Their responsiveness during wedding planning was also extraordinaire, a 10/10. Thank you for making a memorable wedding night!\n(continue reading)\nJunior is Amazing!!\nJackie Wells\nDear Junior,\nA huge thank you for making our Fisher Island February wedding celebration absolutely incredible! Every single detail—from the musicians to the lighting, the LED walls, and the Yembe Drums performers—was beyond amazing.

The energy was unreal, and we had the best time ever!\n\nI can’t tell you how much I appreciate all the effort, professionalism, and attention to detail you put into making everything run so seamlessly.
