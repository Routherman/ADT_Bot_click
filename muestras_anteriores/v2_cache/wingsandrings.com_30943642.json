Via the app, simply click on “claim points” on the home screen and scan the barcode, or manually enter the barcode number and points will automatically be applied (excluding alcohol, retail, and gift card purchases). Via the web portal, guests click on “check in” and manually enter the code to claim the points. Not available on third-party orders.\nHOW ARE OFFERS REDEEMED?\nAvailable offers can be viewed via the app, and when you're ready to redeem, simply click the “redeem” button and provide the offer code to provide to your server (or for coupons that are eligible for online use, enter the code at checkout).\nWHAT IF I ACTIVATE A REWARD AND DO NOT USE IT WITHIN THE REDEEMABLE TIMEFRAME?\nIf you don’t use your reward code, the reward will go back to your account, so it will still be available when you’re ready to use it. Some rewards do have expiration dates associated with them, so you’ll need to redeem the rewards before that time.\nIS THERE A POINTS EARNING CAP?\nMembers are eligible to earn up to 250 points for each purchase (excluding alcohol, gift cards and retail). If you spend more than $250 on qualifying items, you will receive a max of 250 points.\nDO POINTS EXPIRE?\nPoints will automatically expire after 12 months of account inactivity (no claimed points in a 12-month period).\nDO REWARDS EXPIRE?\nYes, once 100 points are turned into a $10 reward, the reward is valid for 60 days from the issue date.\nCAN MORE THAN ONE $10 REWARD BE REDEEMED AT A TIME?\nYes, you can redeem up to $50 in rewards in a transaction on eligible items, but you cannot combine rewards with other coupons.\nIS CATERING INCLUDED?\nYes! Effective 4/4/22, qualifying catering items are eligible for points. To be eligible, the items ordered must be listed on the catering menu found and\nwingsandrings.com/locations\n, or on the online ordering menu (special orders are excluded). There is also an earning cap of 250 points per order.\nI SCANNED THE BARCODE AND DIDN'T GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS AS MY ORDER TOTAL. WHY?\nSome items are excluded from earning points - such as tax, alcohol, gift cards and retail items. Your total earned points should equal the subtotal of your check, minus any of the above items.\nDOES THE FULL $10 REWARD AMOUNT NEED TO BE USED FOR ONE PURCHASE?\nOnce 100 points are earned, you will have “access” to redeem $10 in rewards, but you can choose how many of those rewards dollars to cash in. Any unused portion is saved and can be used on a future redemption.\nWHAT IF I FORGET MY SMARTPHONE? CAN I SCAN THE BARCODE LATER?\nYou have 48 hours to scan your receipt and get credit for the purchase, otherwise the barcode will \"expire\" and no longer be valid to claim.",
