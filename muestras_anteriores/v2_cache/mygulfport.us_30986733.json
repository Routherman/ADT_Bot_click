We accomplish this by:\nMaking available to all residents, by convenient and free access, a wide variety of expertly selected library materials and resources for the public’s educational and informational needs.\nPromoting the enjoyment of reading and books, literacy, lifelong learning, citizenship and the appreciation of the world’s cultural achievements.\nGiving every person the opportunity for involvement, enrichment, inspiration and entertainment.\nThe Library affirms that an informed and involved community is a better community. By providing opportunities for citizens to contribute their time, talents and ideas, as well as by providing access to information and knowledge, the public library greatly contributes to the maintenance and strengthening of our Constitutional rights and freedoms.\nAll citizens are encouraged to use and enjoy the services and resources of the public library. As a traditional and proven component of the best of a community’s learning and educational systems, the public library enriches the lives of the people it serves and it contributes significantly to their quality of life.\n2018 GLBTRT Newlen-Symons Award\nGulfport Public Library received the 2018 GLBTRT Newlen-Symons Award for Excellence in Serving the GLBT Community.\nLibrary Policies\nChild Policy\nGulfport Public Library\nPolicy Title: Unattended Child\nEffective Date: May 2014\nPhilosophy:\nThe Gulfport Public Library is dedicated to providing a welcoming, educational, and safe environment for customers of all ages. Parents, guardians, and caregivers are responsible for the safety, behavior, and supervision of their children at all times in the library and on library property, whether or not they are with the child. When children are left alone they may become frightened or anxious. If they wander through the building they may encounter hazards such as stairs, doors, furniture or electrical equipment. They may also become bored and restless and could disturb the enjoyment and work of others The safety of children left alone in a library building is a serious concern of the library staff. However, the library is a public facility, and staff may not be able to monitor all aspects of patron behavior. Libraries cannot guarantee that a child will be safe in the Library or on library property. The Library does not act in loco parentis.\nStatement of Policy:\nIt is strongly recommended that children be accompanied in the library by a parent, guardian, or assigned caregiver. Staff is not able to provide childcare or babysitting. An exception would be children attending a story time or library program without a parent, guardian or caregiver in the room. However, the parent, guardian or caregiver must remain in the library building and join the child at the end of the program or when summoned by a library staff member to care for the child.\nParents/guardians and caregivers should be aware of library opening and closing times and make suitable arrangements to meet and/or transport their children. In the event that a child is left after library hours and no one can be contacted to provide transportation within fifteen (15) minutes, the staff will call the appropriate law enforcement agency for assistance. Staff will not transport children home or to any other destination under any circumstances.\nViolation of Policy:\nLibrary staff cannot be responsible for children who are unattended or who are demonstrating inappropriate behavior. If a child’s behavior does not conform to the library’s Patron Conduct Policy, or results in a safety issue, the child may be asked to leave the library, a parent may be notified, and/or law enforcement may be called for assistance. Complaints by other library patrons of misbehavior or disturbance by a child, or the need for a staff member to repeatedly approach the child and/or parent, guardian or caregiver about a child’s behavior, may be grounds to ask the child, and anyone accompanying the child, to leave the library immediately.\nLGBTQ Special Collection Donation Policy\nGulfport Public Library\nLGBTQ Special Collection Donation\nPolicy Philosophy\nAs a special collection, we encourage members of the community to invest in our LGBTQ Resource Center by giving both material and monetary donations. We recognize that those who contribute to a special collection often feel sentimental attachment to the specific materials they may donate or request. With this in mind, we ask that you please consider the following guidelines when donating to the collection and thank you for your generosity and understanding.\nPolicy\nGift materials and bequests of private collections are accepted with the understanding that their inclusion in the collection, sale or disposal is subject to the needs of the special collection and become the property of the Gulfport Public Library. As such, they are subject to the same criteria and are evaluated on the same basis as purchased materials and may be added to the library’s collection, donated to the Circle of Friends’ book sale to benefit the library or disposed of at the discretion of the library, LGBTQ Collection Committee Member or designee.\nPlease understand that due to physical limitations and adherence to our collection development policy we will not accept gifts or bequests which have specific stipulations attached. The library cannot appraise the value of materials received as gifts for estate evaluation or tax deduction; however, book donations will be acknowledged with a standardized form for tax purposes if requested.\nRecommendations for acquisitions are welcomed from all members of the library’s community. The staff and LGBTQ Collection Committee evaluate these suggestions according to the criteria an guidelines set forth in the collection development policy. Library materials may be added to the collection in memory or in honor of a specified individual or group by making a monetary donation to the Circle of Friends. A special bookplate will be attached to the item if desired by the donor.\nIf you would like your monetary donation to expressly serve the LGBTQ Resource Center and Special Collection please stipulate your request whenever possible by noting your preference on the memo line of the check or a note attached to a cash donation.\nConfidentiality Policy\nPolicy Title: Confidentiality of Library Records\nEffective Date: September 1, 2013\nPhilosophy\nAs the choice of books and other library materials, along with the use of the informational resources of the library is a personal and private endeavor on the part of each individual patron, adult, or child, the library shall make every effort to see that information about that persons choices remain confidential. To make full and effective use of library resources, people must be confident that others will not become aware of what books they read, the materials they use, the questions they ask. Such a possibility would inhibit free usage of the library and is contrary to the American Library Association’s Bill of Rights and Freedom to Read Statement, and the freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\nStatement of Policy\nIt is the intent of the Gulfport Public Library to protect the privacy of those who use the Library. The Library collects and maintains only the minimum number of records necessary for maintaining operations. In accordance with Florida State Statute 257.261, the Gulfport Public Library shall not disclose any record or other information that identifies a user of library services as requesting or obtaining specific materials or services or as otherwise using the Library. Library user records may be disclosed only in the following circumstances:\nIn accordance with a proper judicial order. If a court order, search warrant or subpoena is issued. Before complying, the library will consult the City Attorney to assure the document is in proper form.\nFor the purpose of collecting fines or recovering overdue books, documents, films, or other items or materials owned or otherwise belonging to the library only, the library may disclose information to\nThe library patron named in the records\nIn the case of a library patron less than 14 years of age, the parent or guardian of that patron named in the records\nAny entity that collects fines on behalf ofthe library\nMunicipal or county law enforcementofficials\nJudicial officials Any person who violates the Statute commits a misdemeanor of the second degree.\nUS Patriot Act of 2001\nLibrary users should be aware that the USA Patriot Act of 2001 increases the authority of federal investigative agencies to compel the disclosure of personal information through use of orders duly issued by a federal court of lawful jurisdiction. Under provisions of the act, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and law enforcement officials may seek court orders for library records for investigations relevant to national security or terrorism. Libraries or librarians served with these orders may not disclose, under penalty of law, the existence of the orders or the fact that records were produced as a result of the orders. Library users cannot be told their records were given to law enforcement agencies or that they were the subjects of FBIinvestigations.\nDonation Policy\nGulfport Public Library Donation Policy\nThe Gulfport Public Library encourages the interest and involvement of the community and accepts donations that support and further the mission, goals, and objectives of the library. The library is an active resource for the community and we encourage our patrons to donate gently used materials to the library. Library staff will process the materials and research whether or not they are appropriate for the collection. All materials not added to the library collection are given to the Circle of Friends of the Library to sell in the Circle Bookshop, donate to another organization, or discard them. 100% of the proceeds of those sales are used toward library programming, material purchases, and other needs of the library.\nTherefore, the library has established the following guidelines on accepted donations.\nThe library accepts new or gently used:\nHardcover and paperback books\nDVDs, CDs and audiobooks\nWeekly magazines that are less than 2 months old\nMonthly magazines that are less than one year old\nTextbooks that have been published within the last 4 years\nThe library cannot accept the following donated items:\nTorn, damaged or moldy materials\nVHS or audio cassettes\nEncyclopedias\nNewspapers\nThe library will accept donated materials during normal business hours.

Use of the meeting room is intended primarily for programs presented by library staff, Circle of Friends of the Library, LGBTQ Resource Center, and other City of Gulfport Departments. When not in use by the aforementioned entities, the room will be available on a first-come, first-served basis for programs or meetings of a cultural or educational nature of interest to the general public. The meeting room is not intended for private social gatherings, entertainment, commercial sales, business solicitations, fundraising, partisan political, unbalanced presentation of controversial matters, and issues that may result in the violation of any local, state, federal law or ordinance.\nReservations and Applications\nUse of the meeting room may be requested by completing and signing a rental agreement form provided by the Library Director or delegate. (See Frances Purdy Friends Room: Use Request / Rental Agreement, attached to this document). Reservations may be made up to 90 days in advance. Please reserve the room 30 days prior to your event to ensure availability.\nThe meeting room is not intended for individual or small private groups (e.g., for tutoring, testing, etc.) or for client counseling, support groups, planning, training, etc. Please refer to our Use of Study Room Policy for use of this nature.\nUse of the room for regularly scheduled (e.g., weekly, monthly) functions by a qualified group may be reserved on a quarterly basis (3 months of meetings). However, the group must apply/reapply every three months to ensure the room is still available.\nWe request that any group wishing to use the meeting room have a primary and a secondary contact. If the leadership or contact information of a group changes before the 3 month term of use is up, we will still honor the contract for the remainder of the term, however; we ask that the new leadership or main contact of the group contact library staff before the next meeting takes place so that we may update our records.\nPlease note regardless of an ongoing or onetime event the first occurrence must be held within 90 days of request.\nReservations may be made by telephone or in person. A reservation will be considered tentative until the signed application is received. The application form must be signed and received by the Library within 48 business hours of the initial application. If 48 hours pass, a final attempt by library staff will be made to make arrangements for signatures. If no signature is given by the end of 1 business day from final contact, the reservation will be canceled.\nGroups must notify the Library of any cancellation at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting. Habitual violation of this term (more than twice in a calendar year), by a specific group who violated the terms may have their meeting room privileges revoked for a period of 1 calendar year.\nGeneral Rules and Regulations\nPrograms or other meetings held in the Friends Room should be free and open to the public at large. No group may charge admission to a meeting held in the Library, solicit or collect a “free will” offering, or present for sale any item which is conditional for attendance at the meeting or program. Sales or other commercial transactions may not be solicited or take place on Library property, nor may memberships or payment of dues be solicited in the Library without the written consent of the City of Gulfport, the Library Director or delegate.\nNo individual will be excluded because of race, nationality, age, sex, handicap, or because of social, religious, or political affiliation. All groups must adhere to Chapter 26 of the City of Gulfport’s Civil Rights or Human Rights Ordinance.\nCommunity groups may advertise, at their own discretion, however; no group may use the Library or City logo on their advertisement. No group may represent the library in any way as having endorsed or promoted the specific program. Library staff may attend or observe any meeting or any program at any time. The name, address, and/or phone number of the library may not be used as the address or headquarters of any group. The Library reserves the right to pre-empt any meeting when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances.\nNo food or beverages are permitted in the meeting room without the approval of the Library Director or delegate. No alcohol will be permitted on the premises without the express permission of the City Manager or designee. If permission to serve light refreshments is granted, it is the responsibility of the individual or group to collect and dispose of trash in appropriate containers and to leave the meeting room, as well as the kitchenette if used, in a clean and sanitary condition. Individuals or groups will be held liable for custodial maintenance or repair if the facilities, furniture and/or equipment are found to be damaged or soiled to a degree requiring exceptional services.\nUsers must not tamper with, attempt to modify, or otherwise change any electrical, plumbing or heating/air conditioning equipment or settings in the Library. Groups failing to comply with these provisions will be given notice that a second offense may result in denial of their future use of the room.\nA Library staff member will operate any Library-owned equipment requested (e.g., television, audio/visual projector, sound system). The Library is not responsible for providing meeting-related equipment or supplies such as coffee pots, cups, extension cords, paper or pencils. Storage space cannot be allotted for non-Library equipment, utensils or supplies to be left at the facility between meetings. Any group that leaves materials behind will be contacted and asked to remove the materials within 48 business hours. If arrangements are not made to pick up the materials they may be donated, recycled, or thrown away.\nDoors must be kept closed while the meeting or program is underway to ensure efficient use of the heating and cooling system and to contain noise.\nMiscellaneous\nFor the purposes of this policy, the Circle of Friends of the Gulfport Public Library, The Gulfport Library LGBTQ Resource Center, all City of Gulfport departments, and all duly constituted City of Gulfport advisory boards may be exempted from any or all of these conditions.\nThe fact that a group is permitted to meet at the Gulfport Public Library does not in any way constitute an endorsement of the group’s policies or beliefs.\nFor the purposes of groups/community organizations who reserve the meeting room, we will display the reservation on our public calendar online, not as “promotion” or “endorsement” of the program, but as notification to the public and other groups that the room is reserved on a specific date/time. The library does not include promotion of community programs and non-library events in print or social media outlets. For this reason, we do not post non-library or community events on the library Facebook page. We are also unable to publish events from other Facebook pages or co-host events with other Facebook pages.\nIn the event that circumstances arise which are not covered by this document, the decisions of the Library Director or delegate are binding.\nBy moving on to the next page you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the terms of the preceding policy.\nIf applying in person please initial each page.\nrev 6/10/2021\nCurrently, all room applications are available at the library.  Call\n727-893-1074\nfor information or stop by the library.\nLibrary Study Room\nAddendum: Library Study Room\nThe room can be used on a “first come, first serve” basis and is meant to be used by any member of the public.
