I was deeply impacted by the stories the women presented on how God has moved in their lives. I began to make new friendships in just a few days. We are not a group of perfect women, but we all fit. We are growing together in friendships that have gone beyond the conference weekend into my life. I have become more active spiritually and I feel God’s presence more deeply.”\nKarolina Zimniak\n“When I walked into the Welcome Weekend, I wasn’t even Catholic. I was excited about growing in my knowledge of the Catholic faith after a lifetime of being Protestant. Yet, I still felt like an outsider. The Welcome Weekend helped me begin to experience St. Raphael’s in a whole new way because it connected me with the women of the parish for the first time. It also helped me to connect more deeply with God. I now have a circle of friends that I can laugh and cry with. We encourage one another and pray for each other, which has been a special blessing for us all.”\nDeb Fusek\nExodus 90: January 20th – Easter\nKick Off:\nThe kick-off date will be announced in the near future.\n90 Day challenge begins January 20th\nIf you have questions about Exodus 90 Contact the Parish Office.\nfusion-row\nNews & Events\nJeremy Katherman\n2024-12-19T09:32:26-05:00\nWelcome Weekend Retreat\nSAVE THE DATE – January 11-12, 2025!  ST RAPHAEL’S WOMEN’S WELCOME WEEKEND RETREAT\nWELCOME is an incredible experience that will recharge your faith life, help you develop lasting friendships, and fill you with newfound energy and purpose.
