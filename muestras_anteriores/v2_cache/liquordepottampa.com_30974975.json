      "text": "Liquor Depot all began 35 years ago and has continued to flourish into the family- owned and operated establishment it is today. Beginning with a single location in 1990, Frank Lawson began to build the business and acquire more locations. Up until three years ago, there were four different locations with various names. (Liquor Depot / City Liquors / Pix Liquors / VIP Liquors) As the business and industry evolved it was time for Frank to either sell the company or offer an opportunity to his son, Trey.\nAt the end of 2018, Trey Lawson moved back to his hometown of Tampa and started to dip his toes into the liquor industry. Frank and Trey worked side by side for two years as Trey learned the ins and outs of the business. With Frank coaching and teaching extremely well, Frank was able to let Trey begin to make business decisions. In 2020, all 4 current liquor store locations were rebranded into one key brand, Liquor Depot. With a new logo and fresh look coming to the stores, it was a new era for Liquor Depot.\nIn 2022, the fifth Liquor Depot location was added to the group. Located off of Waters Ave. The Waters location became the premier location for barrel picks and release days! At the end of 2024, the 6th Liquor Depot location was born. Liquor Depot, Hillsborough touched a new area of Tampa and is the closest liquor store to Raymond James Stadium and Steinbrenner Stadium.\nWith the rise of the bourbon scene aligning with the Liquor Depot brand, social media, and the Tampa Bay community helped propel the stores into a major whiskey destination. With over 120 different barrels selected, Liquor Depot has become a Tampa staple for exclusive barrel selects.\nAlong with the Liquor Depot locations, a new bar was thrown into the mix beginning in 2024. Attached to the Liquor Depot Armenia location, Joy Bar was born. A 365-day-a-year Christmas-themed bar that offers incredible prices, signature drinks, and of course, the holiday spirit! The bar won \"Best Dive Bar\" in Tampa Bay for 2024 and continues to serve North Tampa and surrounding areas. НО НО НО!\nAs the Liquor Depot brand grows, the goal is to keep an amazing selection, competitive prices and a friendly atmosphere. We appreciate you shopping local and supporting a family business.\nLiquor Depot all began 35 years ago and has continued to flourish into the family- owned and operated establishment it is today.
