The only limitation is your creativity! (As one example, a wedding ceremony could be held in one room, followed by dinner in another room, followed by music and dancing in a third room—all in one location.)\nFor those requiring even more space, large events at The Community House can extend to the grounds surrounding the building. Parking areas on the East, South & West sides can be used for outdoor exhibits such as art shows, arts & craft fairs, industrial exhibits, etc. (In these instances, event attendees use The Community House parking lot on the Northside of Periwinkle Way.)\nRental rates at The Community House are reasonable compared to other venues. Tables and chairs are available on-site and included in your rental, as are set-up and break-down services. In addition, linen service is available at a nominal rate.\nA Sanibel Community Association family, business or patron level membership is required to rent the facility. Memberships run for a fixed period, July 1 through June 30.\nclick here to become a member\nRental rates vary depending on the time of year, specific dates, space, and equipment needs, and the amount of time required for your event. Please call\n239-472-2155\nfor current information.\nDonate Today!\nWe invite you to support events in our historic building, the only island venue that is uniquely Sanibel.

Located conveniently on the west end of Periwinkle near Dunlop Road, The Community House is the place to meet neighbors and friends!\n/wp:paragraph\nwp:paragraph\nWe invite you to be a contributing partner and help support events in our historic building, the only island venue that is uniquely Sanibel. There is always something happening at The Community House. Come join us and see!\n/wp:paragraph\nwp:paragraph\nSanibel Community Association Inc. EIN# 59-1060466\nThe Community House serves as the historical heart of the island. Any public, private, individual, or group is welcome.\n/wp:paragraph\nwp:heading\nOne of the First Non-Profits on the Island\n/wp:heading\nwp:paragraph\nSince 1927, The Community House has served as the gathering place of the islands. Many social organizations, civic groups, and clubs that first found a home here at The Community House are still here to this day. Though the Sanibel Community Association and therefore the Community House is not part of the City of Sanibel government or properties, the city actually has its roots here; the famous referendum of 1974 that incorporated the City of Sanibel was held here. The historic Founder’s Room was also the meeting place for the very first City Council meetings. The Community House also hosts many large events and festivals including the Annual Shell Show and Festival. It is one of the largest and longest-running Shell-related shows in the world, and it funds a large portion of SCA’s operations within the community.\n/wp:paragraph\nThe Community House\nWelcome to the Sanibel Community Association. We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization governed by a volunteer board of directors. The funds we raise through membership dues, fundraisers, events, donations and room rental income are used to operate The Community House.\nEstablished in 1927 as a local gathering place for all residents and visitors, The Community House was the birthplace for many civic groups and the incorporation of Sanibel as a city.\nsca board of directors\nEmily Ankerson\nExecutive Director\n~ Email\nKristin Van Olst\nDirector of Engagement\n~ Email\nJennifer Canner\nExecutive Administrative Assistant\n~ Email\nMarco Ospina\nDirector of Programs and Events\n~ Email\nMelanie Moraga\nMembership Development and Communications Support\nHunter Frew\nFacilities\nCurrent Job Openings\nFacility Set Up\nMore Information / Apply Online",
