On our 6 acre farm, we grow vegetables, herbs, flowers, fruit, and microgreens organically without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. From the very beginning, we decided to grow organically. We believe there is no other way to do it. The first plants went into the ground spring of 2013, and our first CSA season was in the fall of 2013.\nSince then, we have grown into an abundant and flourishing farming operation providing clean, fresh, local food to our community in a variety of ways. We partner with other local farms and sell a growing assortment of pasture-raised chicken, eggs, mushrooms, baked and canned goods, and grass-fed/grass-finished beef at our on-site Farm Store. We sell our freshest products to farmer’s markets in Dunedin and St. Pete and we also supply to several restaurants and organizations in the Tampa Bay area.\nOur community is what drives us to do the hard working of farming the highest quality of produce. This is especially true when we get to see firsthand the positive impact it has had on our community.\nWhat We Offer\nGallery Reel\nAbout Us\nOur History\nWe are a regenerative farm located in Clearwater, Florida.
