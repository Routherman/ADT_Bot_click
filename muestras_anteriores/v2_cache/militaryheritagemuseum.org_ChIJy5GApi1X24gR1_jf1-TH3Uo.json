You will also find parking underneath the main museum building as well in the nearby Fishermen’s Village parking areas.\nNamed after the War of 1812’s theater of war that took place throughout the Gulf of Mexico, the Museum’s Gulf Theater is a well-designed auditorium built by the original owners to provide meetings, lectures, and entertainment for its business trainees. With a total of 247 seats, each with a fold-up writing table, the Theater offers the opportunity to deliver all the necessary elements for lectures, training, business meetings, concerts, films, and a variety of performing arts. The Military Heritage Museum leverages the Theater as a critical program area for creating meaningful experiences for the Museum’s members, and visitors along with those businesses and individuals who rent it.\nThe Military Heritage Museum has one of the only two fully-raked theaters in Charlotte County. The unique 247-seat Gulf Theater has been recently upgraded with the latest audiovisual, stage lighting and sound equipment, and a 4K projector.  The investment of $100,000 also included new handrails, a professionally designed new stage floor, and an orchestra pit area. Live-streaming equipment is available for broadcasting programs online as well as high-speed internet access and free Wi-Fi. Supporting the theater are several reception areas including indoor and outdoor seating for up to 100, a set-up kitchen, and other amenities.\nLet us Hear from you👋\nName\nEmail\nMessage\nSubmit\nTHE MILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM IS  A 501(c)(3) NONPROFIT CORPORATION, CLASSIFIED BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND CONSUMER SERVICES AS AN EDUCATIONAL FACILITY AND THEREFORE\nEXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION WITH THAT DEPARTMENT.  IN COMPLIANCE WITH IRS RULES, THE MOST RECENTLY FILED IRS FORM 990 IS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST TO THE MILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM’S OFFICE.\n© 2025  All rights Reserved.

The goal of the Museum — then as now — was to honor veterans from all branches and eras of U.S. military service and to help the general public better understand the contributions and various experiences of American servicemen and women through authentic artifacts and individual stories.\nFrom the start, individual veterans and numerous veteran groups enthusiastically supported the Museum. They generously donated their own personal artifacts and funding; helped build display cases, paint walls and lay carpet; and volunteered as docents.\nRetired Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Warfield Tibbets, Jr., the famed pilot of the “Enola Gay,” the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan, agreed to serve as the Museum’s initial honorary chairman, a position he held until his death in 2007. At that point, Sean O’Keefe, a former Secretary of the Navy and former NASA Administrator, took over the role and continues to serve to this day.\nWithin six years of its grand opening, the Museum had grown significantly in artifacts, financial support, popularity within the community and annual number of visitors, who now hailed from all 50 states and other countries. This led to a move in 2007 to a larger space within Fishermen’s Village that could accommodate the growth. This marked the Museum’s first significant transformation into a more professionally managed museum.\nIn 2013, the Museum expanded again, this time adding space on the second floor above the exhibit area to provide a conference center (available for rent), a military research library, administrative offices and storage.\nAs the Military Heritage Museum continued to grow in popularity, it gained a reputation among tourists and the local community as Southwest Florida’s most treasured museum, in large part because of its personal touch. Veterans lead all tours and offer visitors a unique perspective and understanding of key moments in history that cannot be obtained from a textbook.\nAs of November 2018, the Museum obtained a lease on a new, larger facility in expectation of delivering on the next stage of its vision: the ability to showcase more of its authentic, one-of-a-kind artifact collection and enhance its exhibits and docent-led tours with the latest in video displays, interactive capabilities and touchscreen technologies.\nOur new facility opened on April 16, 2019. The goal, however, remains the same: to honor America’s military veterans, to educate and inspire current and future generations of Americans and to remind everyone that “\nFreedom Isn’t Free\n.”\nThe Military Heritage Museum is a proud member of:\nNorth American Reciprocal Museum (NARM) Association\nTime Travelers (Reciprocal History Museum Membership Network)\nAmerican Association of Museums\nFlorida Association of Museums\nCharlotte County Chamber of Commerce\nPunta Gorda Chamber of Commerce\nGreater Englewood Chamber of Commerce\nArts & Humanities Council of Charlotte County\nCharlotte County Veterans Council\nWe also have a working partnership with the following organizations devoted to veterans, the U.S. military and their causes and concerns:\nAmerican Legion Post 103\nDisabled American Veterans\nDisabled American Veterans, Chapter 82\nFlorida International Air Show\nSouthwest Florida Honor Flight\nWomen in Military Service for America Memorial\nWomen’s Vietnam Memorial\nWitness to War Foundation\nVietnam Wall of Southwest Florida, Inc.\nLet us Hear from you👋\nName\nEmail\nMessage\nSubmit\nMUSEUM NEWS\nStay up to date on the latest news, press coverage and happenings surrounding the Military Heritage Museum.\nFor all media inquiries, please contact us at: 941.575.9002\nIn the News:\nMILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM NAMED “BEST OF FLORIDA” BY FLORIDA GUIDE\nMILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM UNEARTHS HISTORIC TREASURE BELONGING\nTO ESTEEMED ARMY BRIGADIER GENERAL CARROLL\nAMATEUR RADIO EXHIBIT DEDICATION\n11/11/2024\nMILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM ANNOUNCES NEW INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n8/14/2024\nMILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM HOSTS FOURTH OF JULY FAMILY FUN FESTIVAL\n6/12/2024\nVIETNAM VETERAN’S APPRECIATION DAY at the MILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM\n, 3/29/2024\nSweetheart Luncheon and Fashion Show\n, 1/31/2024\nMilitary Heritage Museum Receives $61,115 Amateur Radio Digital Communications Grant\n, 1/12/2024\nDedication of the Berlin Wall Exhibit at the Military Heritage Museum\n, 10/23/2023\nMemorial Day Commemoration\n, 5/10/2023\nMILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM IS NOW A RECIPROCAL MUSEUM\n, 3/29/2023\nMILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM RECEIVES $4,050.00 FROM\nCHARLOTTE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION\n, 3/14/2023\nIRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS’ APPRECIATION DAY\n, 1/5/2023\nNONPROFIT SPOTLIGHT: Volunteers are lifeblood of Military Heritage Museum\n,\nby Sue Wade, Daily Sun, 2/23/2022\nVeteran dies, but leaves behind a future\n,\nby Daniel Sutphin, Staff Writer, Daily Sun\nMilitary Heritage Museum donors get special thanks\nby Daniel Sutphin, Staff Writer, Daily Sun, Jan 26, 2022\nHouse sale to benefit Military Heritage Museum\nby Nancy J.
