Leo Elliott - Former Sarasota High School\nPhoto: Dick Dickinson\nThe Memory Project\nStewarding the Public History and Collective Memory of the Sarasota High School Site\nThe 1926 M. Leo Elliott-designed former Sarasota Senior High School isn’t just a beautiful example of Collegiate neo-Gothic architecture, it is an important historical site that holds a century of Sarasota’s memories. As we embarked upon the transformation of the building into a new contemporary art museum, it was important for us to ensure those memories didn’t disappear. The building is a gravitational center and repository for a century of Sarasota’s rich history, and it’s thrilling to imagine we can add this dimension to the Museum’s mission, adding context and community to the Museum’s programming. Starting in 2015, we began using our historic, ethnographic and museological expertise to preserve, steward and interpret the history and public memory of the SHS site as we transformed the property into a new contemporary art museum.\nDo you have a memory you’d like to share?\nPlease send to\ninfo@sarasota.art\nwith Memory Project in the subject line.\nThe Sarasota Art Museum of Ringling College of Art + Design is the anchor cultural institution of the Ringling College Museum Campus.

Alvarez’s work spans various media, including performance, works on paper, and large-scale vinyl installations – all grounded in the exploration of common human experience.\nComing Together\nwas created for Sarasota Art Museum in 2020 — all in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic that produced feelings of isolation and disconnection for many.\nIn D.O.P.A.’s words:\nIn the act of creating this mural, I thought of the museum as a place of healing. A place that contains within it the possibility of transformation, a place that acts as a vessel of sorts to lift our spirits, celebrate our connections as humans and bring in the possibility of hope. That’s the reason that I named it Coming Together. Not just as an obvious response to our current world atmosphere but actually as a proposal to encourage us to lose ourselves in the objects and activities that we as humans create in order to give our lives meaning. I’ve tried to fill one’s direct and peripheral vision upon entering the space. Continuing my visual inquiry of both the fantastic and the philosophical, I’ve utilized a very bright and welcoming color palette. I try to invite the visitors to contemplate the dance played out in front of them. Ultimately, the painting creates a type of fantastic visual reverie destined to transport the viewer to a higher place. A place of “non judgement” and acceptance. A visual oasis in the midst of an urban setting. A visual testament of our collective story of survival and recovery.\nA story where Art becomes not only a vehicle to transport the viewer, but also a tool to heal myself and others.\nClaire Ashley\nChromatic Blush: Wee Bairn\n2024\n3D animation, AR Software\nMarcy & Michael Klein Plaza\nFor over a decade, Chicago-based artist Claire Ashley has used inflatables as a medium that spans painting, sculpture, installation, and performance. Through her work, she challenges conventional ideas of beauty, taste, and fine art, while melding painterly abstraction, monumental installation, and slapstick humor. Her playful, lumpy, and luminous creations have functioned as both self-portraits and broader commentaries on femme bodies and societal norms.\nBuilding on her evolving artistic practice, Ashley has expanded further into new media, integrating her existing creations with cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) technology. In June 2024, she debuted her first AR piece as part of\nAugmented Chicago: Inaugural Realities\nat Millennium Park, celebrating the park’s 20th anniversary.\nChromatic Blush: Wee Bairn\nbrings Ashley’s characteristic organic shapes and biomorphic forms into the digital realm. These vibrantly colored, glowing, and moving images come to life when viewed through a smartphone or tablet. By scanning a QR code, viewers unlock a dynamic, interactive experience in which two animated, glowing ovular shapes morph, move, and interact like living organisms. These AR creatures have their origin in two small works in Ashley’s larger exhibition titled eponymously. Once triggered by AR technology, the 3D animations breathe life into the painted forms, transforming them from static, physical objects into fluid, ever-changing entities that live in the digital realm.\nChromatic Blush: Wee Bairn\ncreates an immersive environment that challenges perceptions of the visual field and explores questions about the future of humanity and living organisms. Accompanied by a soundscape composed by her longtime collaborator, Joshua Patterson, this work invites viewers to engage with its vibrant, pulsating presence, charged with playful, raunchy energy. Ashley imagines a future where hybrid organisms emerge from the Anthropocene, inviting us to envision new possibilities for evolution in an increasingly complex world.\nOriginally from Edinburgh, Scotland,\nAshley received her MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and her BFA from Gray’s School of Art, Aberdeen, Scotland. She currently teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Department of Contemporary Practices and the Department of Painting and Drawing. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally in galleries, museums, site-specific installations, performances, and collaborations such as the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds, United Kingdom; Beacon Arts Center, Scotland; the Louis Kahn Library at Phillips Exeter Academy, New Hampshire; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas; and the Chicago Cultural Center, among many others. Her work has been featured in\nStudio International\n,\nVICE, Hyperallergic\n,\nArtforum\nSculpture Magazine\n,\nArt Papers\n, and\nThe Boston Globe\n.\nLearn more about Claire Ashley’s exhibition at\nChromatic Blush\nat Sarasota Art Museum.\nClaire Ashley: Chromatic Blush\nChakaia Booker (American, born 1953)\nSquare Peg\n2003\nRubber tires, wood, and steel\nMarcy & Michael Klein Plaza\nRenowned for her colossal, abstract sculptures made with discarded rubber tires, Chakaia Booker transforms the mundane into the magnificent. With industrial materials such as wood, steel, and rubber, Booker’s works dynamically address socioeconomic anxieties, racial identity, cultural heritage, globalization, consumerism, and environmental degradation, among other pressing concerns.\nS\nquare Peg\n— a monumental sculpture weighing over 2,000 pounds — can be seen as a visual convergence of the disruptive and harmonious elements of our world. The phrase “forcing a square peg into a round hole” is frequently used to describe people, ideologies, or methods that simply do not fit, a notion Booker subverts by uniting component parts to fashion a greater, complex whole. The inorganic, manufactured rubber and organic, natural wood are purposefully entangled, creating a composition of interdependent fragments that spring outward from and overtake the crescent-shaped frame. The work’s impressive physicality emphasizes Booker’s use of materials too often taken for granted within society.\nBooker obtained a BA in sociology from Rutgers University in 1976 and an MFA in sculpture and painting from The City College of New York in 1993. She also studied African dance, ceramics, weaving, basketry, and tai ’chi.\nBooker’s works are held in more than 40 public collections and have been exhibited nationally and internationally. She was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2005. Public installation highlights include Millennium Park, Chicago (2016-2018), Garment District Alliance Broadway Plazas, New York (2014), and National Museum of Women in the Arts New York Avenue Sculpture Project, Washington, D.C. (2012). In 2013, Chakaia Booker presented eight sculptures at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune building for the biennial Season of Sculpture’s off-year “Conversations with Artists” program.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nJohn Clement\nShazam\n2014\nSteel, steel plate, and paint.\nCourtesy of Keith Monda and Veronica Brady\nConservatory\nShazam\n(2014) by Brooklyn-based sculptor John Clement is a striking example of contemporary Constructivist-inspired sculpture. Influenced by the monumental works of his mentors, Marc di Suvero and John Henry, Clement pushes the boundaries of the genre by transforming utilitarian materials into playful, gravity-defying structures.\nClement cuts, bends, and welds industrial elements to construct these large-scale, interconnected arrangements. Much like three-dimensional line drawings, the artist’s curvilinear compositions explore form, space, movement, and balance to create sculptures that appear deceivingly simple.\nIn\nShazam\n, sweeping curves are carefully balanced on a single intersecting line, creating a form that seems to be on the verge of teetering out of place. Despite its large scale and industrial materials, the sculpture, painted in a vibrant blue, feels light, joyful, and full of movement.\nBorn in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1969, Clement received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992 before studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York. He began working with di Suvero and Henry in the 1990s, and has since exhibited widely, with public sculptures installed across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nJohn Clement (American, born 1969)\nShazam\n. 2014.

Natural forms in a manufactured material become organic through the imperfection of hand mixing colors and perfection of techniques. The additive process for construction uses the repetition of the ROYGBIV mnemonic to create the variety of individual colors throughout the trees form. The crown’s alien like crystal ball leaves allowed the artist to explore reflection, imperfection, and understanding of the purpose of “leaves”. Influenced by Iris Apfel’s extraordinary color palette and motto “\nMore is more, less is a bore\n”, Davis’ tree consists of over 8,000 pom poms, 1000+ glass and resin balls, 10 skeins of yarn, and 35 lbs of plastic, as well as bottles and other items found throughout the artist’s home. Davis’ tree projects a renewed sense of joy and serves as a beacon of brightness within the trying times we experienced 2020-2022.\nSamo Davis,\nHappiness in ROYGBIV\n, 2021\nPlastic, pom poms, resin, yarn, clay, recycled materials.\nCourtesy of the artist.\nPhoto: Sarasota Art Museum\nMolly Hatch\nStaccato\n2017/2022\nCeramic\nCourtesy of the artist and Todd Merrill Studio\nBistro\nMolly Hatch’s signature plate paintings—large-scale installations of hand-glazed ceramic plates—reimagine historical decorative arts through a contemporary lens, while bridging the gap between decorative and fine art. The piece Staccato diffuses an 18th century Chinese export pattern from Owen Jones’ book The Grammar of Chinese Ornament over a gridded installation of 108 hand-painted earthenware plates. The glazed surfaces collectively become a fragmented canvas for a delicate, painterly re-rendering.\nMolly Hatch (b. 1978) earned her BFA at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, at Tufts, and then received her MFA in ceramics from the University of Colorado. Hatch considers herself a painter “who just happens to choose the surface of ceramics instead of canvas.”\n1\n“I want people to view plates as one would view a painting,” notes Hatch. “As we move through our daily lives, eating breakfast, sipping an afternoon cup of tea or gathering for a family dinner, the patterned ceramic objects we live with are precious witnesses to our stories.”\n2\nPreview Molly Hatch's\nAmalgam\n1\nMichael Woodson, “Fine Art Meets Fine Dining | This Artist Creates One-Of-A-Kind Ceramic Art,” Artistsnetwork, Accessed October 26, 2022, https://www.artistsnetwork.com/magazine/molly-hatch-creates-ceramic-art/.\n2\nMolly Hatch,\nA Passion for China: A Little Book About the Objects We Eat From, Live With and Love\n(September Publishing, UK, 2017), 11.\nMolly Hatch\nStaccato\n2017/2022\nCeramic\n40 x 270 in.\nCourtesy of the artist and Todd Merrill Studio\nJohn Henry\nComplexus\n2007\nPainted Steel\nOn loan from the City of Sarasota\nGreat Lawn\nJohn Henry (1943 – 2022, Lexington, Kentucky) is acclaimed for his monumental sculptures composed of floating beams and primary colors.\nStanding 70 feet tall,\nComplexus\nwas completed in Henry’s signature style: a grand statement of mass and color constructed with refined, geometric forms. While the sculpture is composed of basic shapes, Henry orients them in a complicated puzzle of floating and leaning pieces, creating a visual paradox – the sculpture appears both grounded as a large steel structure, yet also airy, as pieces float amongst the background of the sky.\nHenry’s large-scale sculptures have made their mark on landscapes across the United States. All of his sculptures are designed and constructed in his studio in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\nLearn more about this exhibition\nJohn Henry,\nComplexus\n, 2007\nPainted steel\nJillian Mayer\nSlumpies\n2025\nFiberglass, polyurethane plastic, wood, and acrylic\nCourtesy of the artist\nMarcy & Michael Klein Plaza\nJillian Mayer explores our ever-increasing relationship with technological devices and the impact device usage has on our bodies through her interactive sculpture series,\nSlumpies\n.

Trained in the beaux-arts tradition, Mosset’s work disrupts illusionistic conventions in art and returns to the foundation of painting with pure color and form.\nMosset represented Switzerland in the 1994 Venice Biennial and has influenced generations of artists, such as Odili Donald Odita, whose work can be seen in the Loggia. Coming of artistic age in the 1960s, Mosset was steeped in avant-garde gestures designed to actively resist the commodification of art. As a member of BMPT,a mid-1960s, Paris-based art group composed of painters Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni, Mosset aimed to create artwork that referred to nothing but itself. Mosset continued to focus on pure color, shape, and authorship after BMPT disbanded, as seen with the prints featured here and the site responsive painting installation on the façade of the Vocational Shops building designed by Paul Rudolph in 1959. Mosset has collaborated with architects such as Jean Nouvel, subtly enhancing architectonic features with his reductive monochromes. In this case, the metal casements of previous doors became the frame for a painting, playing on the notion that a painting is always a portal to another dimension or plane. A young boy, upon visiting Mosset’s collection of the minimal artists who have been influenced by him remarked “You know, where there is less to see, you look more carefully.”\nLeah Rosenberg\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n2019\nLatex and acrylic paint\nCourtesy of the artist\nMuseum Lobby and stairwell\nFor Leah Rosenberg (b. 1979, Michigan), color and process play a primary role in her body of work spanning painting, sculpture, printmaking, food and performance.\nIn\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n, Leah Rosenberg surveyed our hometown on foot and chose twenty-eight colors to represent specific aspects of Sarasota. On view you will see Purple Hyacinth of the Van Wezel, Sea Star of manatees at MOTE, Vermillion of circus stripes, Tangy Orange of the Sarasota High School team colors, and Oregano of palm tree leaves, among twenty-three other colorful interpretations. The shape of the installation responds to the architecture of the building, transforming from solid stripes in the Lobby that then begin to sway and segment into playful confetti in the stairwell, and ultimately fall back into a structured pattern that mimics the original brick masonry.\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson\nVita in Motu\n2019\nSolar Projection, Color Motion Picture, a durational site-specific installation with dichroic film, acrylic and glass\nCourtesy of the artist\nMuseum Third Floor – Jonathan McCague Arcade\nChristian Sampson (b. 1974) works with both tangible and intangible materials – Plexiglas, polymers, wood, dyes, light, reflection and shadow – to experiment with space and perception. His works are often site-specific, uniquely responding to architectural space. The ephemeral and ever-changing nature of these colored light projections aligns closely with early cinematic animation and filmmaking experiments.\nThe site-specific installation\nVita in Motu\nconscripts the architecture of the building, and the solar system, as collaborators to create an ever-changing dazzling color and light show, reminding us of our place in the universe and that color is light, constantly in flux, and subject to one’s perspective.\nClick here to see more photos of\nVita in Motu\nChristian Sampson,\nVita in Motu\n(2019)\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson,\nVita in Motu\n(2019)\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson,\nVita in Motu\n(2019)\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nNext\nNow\nBefore\nJillian Mayer.\nSlumpie 75-Work Desk 4 Lefties\n, 2025.

The piece Staccato diffuses an 18th century Chinese export pattern from Owen Jones’ book The Grammar of Chinese Ornament over a gridded installation of 108 hand-painted earthenware plates. The glazed surfaces collectively become a fragmented canvas for a delicate, painterly re-rendering.\nMolly Hatch (b. 1978) earned her BFA at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, at Tufts, and then received her MFA in ceramics from the University of Colorado. Hatch considers herself a painter “who just happens to choose the surface of ceramics instead of canvas.”\n1\n“I want people to view plates as one would view a painting,” notes Hatch. “As we move through our daily lives, eating breakfast, sipping an afternoon cup of tea or gathering for a family dinner, the patterned ceramic objects we live with are precious witnesses to our stories.”\n2\nPreview Molly Hatch's\nAmalgam\n1\nMichael Woodson, “Fine Art Meets Fine Dining | This Artist Creates One-Of-A-Kind Ceramic Art,” Artistsnetwork, Accessed October 26, 2022, https://www.artistsnetwork.com/magazine/molly-hatch-creates-ceramic-art/.\n2\nMolly Hatch,\nA Passion for China: A Little Book About the Objects We Eat From, Live With and Love\n(September Publishing, UK, 2017), 11.\nMolly Hatch\nStaccato\n2017/2022\nCeramic\n40 x 270 in.\nCourtesy of the artist and Todd Merrill Studio\nJohn Henry\nComplexus\n2007\nPainted Steel\nOn loan from the City of Sarasota\nGreat Lawn\nJohn Henry (1943 – 2022, Lexington, Kentucky) is acclaimed for his monumental sculptures composed of floating beams and primary colors.\nStanding 70 feet tall,\nComplexus\nwas completed in Henry’s signature style: a grand statement of mass and color constructed with refined, geometric forms. While the sculpture is composed of basic shapes, Henry orients them in a complicated puzzle of floating and leaning pieces, creating a visual paradox – the sculpture appears both grounded as a large steel structure, yet also airy, as pieces float amongst the background of the sky.\nHenry’s large-scale sculptures have made their mark on landscapes across the United States.

Trained in the beaux-arts tradition, Mosset’s work disrupts illusionistic conventions in art and returns to the foundation of painting with pure color and form.\nMosset represented Switzerland in the 1994 Venice Biennial and has influenced generations of artists, such as Odili Donald Odita, whose work can be seen in the Loggia. Coming of artistic age in the 1960s, Mosset was steeped in avant-garde gestures designed to actively resist the commodification of art. As a member of BMPT,a mid-1960s, Paris-based art group composed of painters Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni, Mosset aimed to create artwork that referred to nothing but itself. Mosset continued to focus on pure color, shape, and authorship after BMPT disbanded, as seen with the prints featured here and the site responsive painting installation on the façade of the Vocational Shops building designed by Paul Rudolph in 1959. Mosset has collaborated with architects such as Jean Nouvel, subtly enhancing architectonic features with his reductive monochromes. In this case, the metal casements of previous doors became the frame for a painting, playing on the notion that a painting is always a portal to another dimension or plane. A young boy, upon visiting Mosset’s collection of the minimal artists who have been influenced by him remarked “You know, where there is less to see, you look more carefully.”\nLeah Rosenberg\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n2019\nLatex and acrylic paint\nCourtesy of the artist\nMuseum Lobby and stairwell\nFor Leah Rosenberg (b. 1979, Michigan), color and process play a primary role in her body of work spanning painting, sculpture, printmaking, food and performance.\nIn\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n, Leah Rosenberg surveyed our hometown on foot and chose twenty-eight colors to represent specific aspects of Sarasota. On view you will see Purple Hyacinth of the Van Wezel, Sea Star of manatees at MOTE, Vermillion of circus stripes, Tangy Orange of the Sarasota High School team colors, and Oregano of palm tree leaves, among twenty-three other colorful interpretations. The shape of the installation responds to the architecture of the building, transforming from solid stripes in the Lobby that then begin to sway and segment into playful confetti in the stairwell, and ultimately fall back into a structured pattern that mimics the original brick masonry.\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson\nVita in Motu\n2019\nSolar Projection, Color Motion Picture, a durational site-specific installation with dichroic film, acrylic and glass\nCourtesy of the artist\nMuseum Third Floor – Jonathan McCague Arcade\nChristian Sampson (b. 1974) works with both tangible and intangible materials – Plexiglas, polymers, wood, dyes, light, reflection and shadow – to experiment with space and perception.

Alvarez’s work spans various media, including performance, works on paper, and large-scale vinyl installations – all grounded in the exploration of common human experience.\nComing Together\nwas created for Sarasota Art Museum in 2020 — all in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic that produced feelings of isolation and disconnection for many.\nIn D.O.P.A.’s words:\nIn the act of creating this mural, I thought of the museum as a place of healing. A place that contains within it the possibility of transformation, a place that acts as a vessel of sorts to lift our spirits, celebrate our connections as humans and bring in the possibility of hope. That’s the reason that I named it Coming Together. Not just as an obvious response to our current world atmosphere but actually as a proposal to encourage us to lose ourselves in the objects and activities that we as humans create in order to give our lives meaning. I’ve tried to fill one’s direct and peripheral vision upon entering the space. Continuing my visual inquiry of both the fantastic and the philosophical, I’ve utilized a very bright and welcoming color palette. I try to invite the visitors to contemplate the dance played out in front of them. Ultimately, the painting creates a type of fantastic visual reverie destined to transport the viewer to a higher place. A place of “non judgement” and acceptance. A visual oasis in the midst of an urban setting. A visual testament of our collective story of survival and recovery.\nA story where Art becomes not only a vehicle to transport the viewer, but also a tool to heal myself and others.\nClaire Ashley\nChromatic Blush: Wee Bairn\n2024\n3D animation, AR Software\nMarcy & Michael Klein Plaza\nFor over a decade, Chicago-based artist Claire Ashley has used inflatables as a medium that spans painting, sculpture, installation, and performance. Through her work, she challenges conventional ideas of beauty, taste, and fine art, while melding painterly abstraction, monumental installation, and slapstick humor. Her playful, lumpy, and luminous creations have functioned as both self-portraits and broader commentaries on femme bodies and societal norms.\nBuilding on her evolving artistic practice, Ashley has expanded further into new media, integrating her existing creations with cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) technology. In June 2024, she debuted her first AR piece as part of\nAugmented Chicago: Inaugural Realities\nat Millennium Park, celebrating the park’s 20th anniversary.\nChromatic Blush: Wee Bairn\nbrings Ashley’s characteristic organic shapes and biomorphic forms into the digital realm. These vibrantly colored, glowing, and moving images come to life when viewed through a smartphone or tablet. By scanning a QR code, viewers unlock a dynamic, interactive experience in which two animated, glowing ovular shapes morph, move, and interact like living organisms. These AR creatures have their origin in two small works in Ashley’s larger exhibition titled eponymously. Once triggered by AR technology, the 3D animations breathe life into the painted forms, transforming them from static, physical objects into fluid, ever-changing entities that live in the digital realm.\nChromatic Blush: Wee Bairn\ncreates an immersive environment that challenges perceptions of the visual field and explores questions about the future of humanity and living organisms. Accompanied by a soundscape composed by her longtime collaborator, Joshua Patterson, this work invites viewers to engage with its vibrant, pulsating presence, charged with playful, raunchy energy. Ashley imagines a future where hybrid organisms emerge from the Anthropocene, inviting us to envision new possibilities for evolution in an increasingly complex world.\nOriginally from Edinburgh, Scotland,\nAshley received her MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and her BFA from Gray’s School of Art, Aberdeen, Scotland. She currently teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Department of Contemporary Practices and the Department of Painting and Drawing. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally in galleries, museums, site-specific installations, performances, and collaborations such as the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds, United Kingdom; Beacon Arts Center, Scotland; the Louis Kahn Library at Phillips Exeter Academy, New Hampshire; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas; and the Chicago Cultural Center, among many others. Her work has been featured in\nStudio International\n,\nVICE, Hyperallergic\n,\nArtforum\nSculpture Magazine\n,\nArt Papers\n, and\nThe Boston Globe\n.\nLearn more about Claire Ashley’s exhibition at\nChromatic Blush\nat Sarasota Art Museum.\nClaire Ashley: Chromatic Blush\nChakaia Booker (American, born 1953)\nSquare Peg\n2003\nRubber tires, wood, and steel\nMarcy & Michael Klein Plaza\nRenowned for her colossal, abstract sculptures made with discarded rubber tires, Chakaia Booker transforms the mundane into the magnificent. With industrial materials such as wood, steel, and rubber, Booker’s works dynamically address socioeconomic anxieties, racial identity, cultural heritage, globalization, consumerism, and environmental degradation, among other pressing concerns.\nS\nquare Peg\n— a monumental sculpture weighing over 2,000 pounds — can be seen as a visual convergence of the disruptive and harmonious elements of our world. The phrase “forcing a square peg into a round hole” is frequently used to describe people, ideologies, or methods that simply do not fit, a notion Booker subverts by uniting component parts to fashion a greater, complex whole. The inorganic, manufactured rubber and organic, natural wood are purposefully entangled, creating a composition of interdependent fragments that spring outward from and overtake the crescent-shaped frame. The work’s impressive physicality emphasizes Booker’s use of materials too often taken for granted within society.\nBooker obtained a BA in sociology from Rutgers University in 1976 and an MFA in sculpture and painting from The City College of New York in 1993. She also studied African dance, ceramics, weaving, basketry, and tai ’chi.\nBooker’s works are held in more than 40 public collections and have been exhibited nationally and internationally. She was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2005. Public installation highlights include Millennium Park, Chicago (2016-2018), Garment District Alliance Broadway Plazas, New York (2014), and National Museum of Women in the Arts New York Avenue Sculpture Project, Washington, D.C. (2012). In 2013, Chakaia Booker presented eight sculptures at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune building for the biennial Season of Sculpture’s off-year “Conversations with Artists” program.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nJohn Clement\nShazam\n2014\nSteel, steel plate, and paint.\nCourtesy of Keith Monda and Veronica Brady\nConservatory\nShazam\n(2014) by Brooklyn-based sculptor John Clement is a striking example of contemporary Constructivist-inspired sculpture. Influenced by the monumental works of his mentors, Marc di Suvero and John Henry, Clement pushes the boundaries of the genre by transforming utilitarian materials into playful, gravity-defying structures.\nClement cuts, bends, and welds industrial elements to construct these large-scale, interconnected arrangements. Much like three-dimensional line drawings, the artist’s curvilinear compositions explore form, space, movement, and balance to create sculptures that appear deceivingly simple.\nIn\nShazam\n, sweeping curves are carefully balanced on a single intersecting line, creating a form that seems to be on the verge of teetering out of place. Despite its large scale and industrial materials, the sculpture, painted in a vibrant blue, feels light, joyful, and full of movement.\nBorn in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1969, Clement received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992 before studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York. He began working with di Suvero and Henry in the 1990s, and has since exhibited widely, with public sculptures installed across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nJohn Clement (American, born 1969)\nShazam\n. 2014.

Natural forms in a manufactured material become organic through the imperfection of hand mixing colors and perfection of techniques. The additive process for construction uses the repetition of the ROYGBIV mnemonic to create the variety of individual colors throughout the trees form. The crown’s alien like crystal ball leaves allowed the artist to explore reflection, imperfection, and understanding of the purpose of “leaves”. Influenced by Iris Apfel’s extraordinary color palette and motto “\nMore is more, less is a bore\n”, Davis’ tree consists of over 8,000 pom poms, 1000+ glass and resin balls, 10 skeins of yarn, and 35 lbs of plastic, as well as bottles and other items found throughout the artist’s home. Davis’ tree projects a renewed sense of joy and serves as a beacon of brightness within the trying times we experienced 2020-2022.\nSamo Davis,\nHappiness in ROYGBIV\n, 2021\nPlastic, pom poms, resin, yarn, clay, recycled materials.\nCourtesy of the artist.\nPhoto: Sarasota Art Museum\nMolly Hatch\nStaccato\n2017/2022\nCeramic\nCourtesy of the artist and Todd Merrill Studio\nBistro\nMolly Hatch’s signature plate paintings—large-scale installations of hand-glazed ceramic plates—reimagine historical decorative arts through a contemporary lens, while bridging the gap between decorative and fine art.

She was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2005. Public installation highlights include Millennium Park, Chicago (2016-2018), Garment District Alliance Broadway Plazas, New York (2014), and National Museum of Women in the Arts New York Avenue Sculpture Project, Washington, D.C. (2012). In 2013, Chakaia Booker presented eight sculptures at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune building for the biennial Season of Sculpture’s off-year “Conversations with Artists” program.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nInstallation view of Chakaia Booker (American, born 1953).\nSquare Peg\n, 2003.\nRubber tires, wood, and steel.\nJohn Clement\nShazam\n2014\nSteel, steel plate, and paint.\nCourtesy of Keith Monda and Veronica Brady\nConservatory\nShazam\n(2014) by Brooklyn-based sculptor John Clement is a striking example of contemporary Constructivist-inspired sculpture. Influenced by the monumental works of his mentors, Marc di Suvero and John Henry, Clement pushes the boundaries of the genre by transforming utilitarian materials into playful, gravity-defying structures.\nClement cuts, bends, and welds industrial elements to construct these large-scale, interconnected arrangements. Much like three-dimensional line drawings, the artist’s curvilinear compositions explore form, space, movement, and balance to create sculptures that appear deceivingly simple.\nIn\nShazam\n, sweeping curves are carefully balanced on a single intersecting line, creating a form that seems to be on the verge of teetering out of place. Despite its large scale and industrial materials, the sculpture, painted in a vibrant blue, feels light, joyful, and full of movement.\nBorn in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1969, Clement received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992 before studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York. He began working with di Suvero and Henry in the 1990s, and has since exhibited widely, with public sculptures installed across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nJohn Clement (American, born 1969)\nShazam\n. 2014.

Natural forms in a manufactured material become organic through the imperfection of hand mixing colors and perfection of techniques. The additive process for construction uses the repetition of the ROYGBIV mnemonic to create the variety of individual colors throughout the trees form. The crown’s alien like crystal ball leaves allowed the artist to explore reflection, imperfection, and understanding of the purpose of “leaves”. Influenced by Iris Apfel’s extraordinary color palette and motto “\nMore is more, less is a bore\n”, Davis’ tree consists of over 8,000 pom poms, 1000+ glass and resin balls, 10 skeins of yarn, and 35 lbs of plastic, as well as bottles and other items found throughout the artist’s home. Davis’ tree projects a renewed sense of joy and serves as a beacon of brightness within the trying times we experienced 2020-2022.\nSamo Davis,\nHappiness in ROYGBIV\n, 2021\nPlastic, pom poms, resin, yarn, clay, recycled materials.\nCourtesy of the artist.\nPhoto: Sarasota Art Museum\nMolly Hatch\nStaccato\n2017/2022\nCeramic\nCourtesy of the artist and Todd Merrill Studio\nBistro\nMolly Hatch’s signature plate paintings—large-scale installations of hand-glazed ceramic plates—reimagine historical decorative arts through a contemporary lens, while bridging the gap between decorative and fine art. The piece Staccato diffuses an 18th century Chinese export pattern from Owen Jones’ book The Grammar of Chinese Ornament over a gridded installation of 108 hand-painted earthenware plates. The glazed surfaces collectively become a fragmented canvas for a delicate, painterly re-rendering.\nMolly Hatch (b. 1978) earned her BFA at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, at Tufts, and then received her MFA in ceramics from the University of Colorado. Hatch considers herself a painter “who just happens to choose the surface of ceramics instead of canvas.”\n1\n“I want people to view plates as one would view a painting,” notes Hatch. “As we move through our daily lives, eating breakfast, sipping an afternoon cup of tea or gathering for a family dinner, the patterned ceramic objects we live with are precious witnesses to our stories.”\n2\nPreview Molly Hatch's\nAmalgam\n1\nMichael Woodson, “Fine Art Meets Fine Dining | This Artist Creates One-Of-A-Kind Ceramic Art,” Artistsnetwork, Accessed October 26, 2022, https://www.artistsnetwork.com/magazine/molly-hatch-creates-ceramic-art/.\n2\nMolly Hatch,\nA Passion for China: A Little Book About the Objects We Eat From, Live With and Love\n(September Publishing, UK, 2017), 11.\nMolly Hatch\nStaccato\n2017/2022\nCeramic\n40 x 270 in.\nCourtesy of the artist and Todd Merrill Studio\nJohn Henry\nComplexus\n2007\nPainted Steel\nOn loan from the City of Sarasota\nGreat Lawn\nJohn Henry (1943 – 2022, Lexington, Kentucky) is acclaimed for his monumental sculptures composed of floating beams and primary colors.\nStanding 70 feet tall,\nComplexus\nwas completed in Henry’s signature style: a grand statement of mass and color constructed with refined, geometric forms. While the sculpture is composed of basic shapes, Henry orients them in a complicated puzzle of floating and leaning pieces, creating a visual paradox – the sculpture appears both grounded as a large steel structure, yet also airy, as pieces float amongst the background of the sky.\nHenry’s large-scale sculptures have made their mark on landscapes across the United States. All of his sculptures are designed and constructed in his studio in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\nLearn more about this exhibition\nJohn Henry,\nComplexus\n, 2007\nPainted steel\nOlivier Mosset\nUntitled\n2019\nAcrylic on masonry\nCourtesy of the artist\nMarcy & Michael Klein Plaza\nOlivier Mosset,\nUntitled\n(2019)\nAcrylic on masonry\nCourtesy of the artist\nOlivier Mosset,\nUntitled\n(2019)\nAcrylic on masonry\nCourtesy of the artist\nLeah Rosenberg\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n2019\nLatex and acrylic paint\nCourtesy of the artist\nMuseum Lobby and stairwell\nFor Leah Rosenberg (b. 1979, Michigan), color and process play a primary role in her body of work spanning painting, sculpture, printmaking, food and performance.\nIn\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n, Leah Rosenberg surveyed our hometown on foot and chose twenty-eight colors to represent specific aspects of Sarasota. On view you will see Purple Hyacinth of the Van Wezel, Sea Star of manatees at MOTE, Vermillion of circus stripes, Tangy Orange of the Sarasota High School team colors, and Oregano of palm tree leaves, among twenty-three other colorful interpretations. The shape of the installation responds to the architecture of the building, transforming from solid stripes in the Lobby that then begin to sway and segment into playful confetti in the stairwell, and ultimately fall back into a structured pattern that mimics the original brick masonry.\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nLeah Rosenberg,\n28 Colors (Sarasota, FL)\n(2019)\nLatex and acrylic paint\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson\nVita in Motu\n2019\nSolar Projection, Color Motion Picture, a durational site-specific installation with dichroic film, acrylic and glass\nCourtesy of the artist\nMuseum Third Floor – Jonathan McCague Arcade\nChristian Sampson (b. 1974) works with both tangible and intangible materials – Plexiglas, polymers, wood, dyes, light, reflection and shadow – to experiment with space and perception. His works are often site-specific, uniquely responding to architectural space. The ephemeral and ever-changing nature of these colored light projections aligns closely with early cinematic animation and filmmaking experiments.\nThe site-specific installation\nVita in Motu\nconscripts the architecture of the building, and the solar system, as collaborators to create an ever-changing dazzling color and light show, reminding us of our place in the universe and that color is light, constantly in flux, and subject to one’s perspective.\nClick here to see more photos of\nVita in Motu\nChristian Sampson,\nVita in Motu\n(2019)\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson,\nVita in Motu\n(2019)\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nChristian Sampson,\nVita in Motu\n(2019)\nPhoto: Coke Wisdom O'Neal\nNext\nNow\nBefore",
