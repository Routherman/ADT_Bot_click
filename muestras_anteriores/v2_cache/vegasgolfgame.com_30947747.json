We will be writing down each foursome along with your wager.\nWe would like each foursome to donate all of the negative chips (Water, Trees, Sand, 8-Ball, 3-Putt) to Breast Cancer. Whoever ends up with these chips at the end of 18 holes….please do not pay the other players! Once all of the foursomes are back at the clubhouse we will announce each foursome.
