      "text": "About Us\nPatty Narozny\nFounder & Executive Director\nHot Works Fine Art Shows Founder, Patty Narozny,\nentered the art world in 2002 with a unique set of media qualifications that enabled her to organize, market, produce, and curate the submissions for her award-winning fine art and craft shows. Armed with a B.S. in Corporate Finance from Detroit’s Wayne State University (1986), she started as comptroller for Detroit’s alternative art-heavy newsweekly, which led her to a management position at Detroit’s NBC affiliate, a pivotal point in Ms. Narozny’s career.\nIt was at NBC WDIV in Detroit where she learned the fine art of media negotiation, which largely accounts for the extensive media coverage her shows receive on the most limited of budgets. Combining strategic media buys with social media and digital marketing, Narozny has run hundreds of commercial spots in the regions where each of her shows is held.\nSuccess came early when in 2006 Narozny’s flagship Orchard Fine Art Show was voted one of America’s Top 100 Art Fairs by Sunshine Artists Magazine. Today, Hot Works Fine Art & Craft Shows in Boca Raton, Estero/Fort Myers, and Orchard Lake/West Bloomfield have been recognized nationally in the Top 100 Art Fairs in America list.\nHot Works media partnerships created the seeds for success which allowed Narozny to expand and create Institute for the Arts and Education, a 501c-3 non-profit for community outreach programs, and the nationally recognized Youth Arts Competition held at each Hot Works Fine Art & Craft Show.\nOver the years, Narozny has built a loyal following of nationally recognized artists and art patrons due to her high standards of quality and her determination to keep her show 100% authentic original fine art and fine handcrafts made and represented by the artist in person. The nationwide presence of imports and buy/sell products are so prevalent in today’s art fair scene that many shows have just given up trying to maintain authenticity. Narozny sees this as a break in the trust that art patrons expect from any quality art show. While it’s an ongoing struggle, Narozny keeps an eye on the forged and fake “art” coming into this country and trusts her artist exhibitors to assist in the effort to keep every piece of art shown at Hot Works Fine Art Shows authentic.\nShe is one-of-a-kind in the world of art fairs. Ms. Narozny and her husband, both avid gardeners, reside in White Lake, Michigan.\nPatty Narozny\nFounder & Executive Director\nHot Works Fine Art Shows Founder, Patty Narozny,\nentered the art world in 2002 with a unique set of media qualifications that enabled her to organize, market, produce, and curate the submissions for her award-winning fine art and craft shows.
