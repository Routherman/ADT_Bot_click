If you're looking for bottomless mimosa, delicious food and great music this is the place to be! (They have a DJ)\nFood 5/5- the food was delicious! I had the brunch burger and it was honestly the best burger I've had in a while.\nAmbiance 5/5- the music is amazing. It was a mix of r&b throwbacks a little hip hop and some pop. The place is also very cute!\nService 5/5- our server was great! We did the bottomless mimosas and let's just say our glass was never empty.\nThey have parking available right in front of the restaurant.\nOverall I would recommend this place for a girl's brunch or with a group.”\nShanique R. – ★★★★★\nLas Olas\nI love brunch mostly for the bottomless mimosas because every place has the same brunch food items. Until we tried American Social! The brunch in the keys is a shrimp cake topped with green goddess sauce and the combination of that and the hollandaise sauce is so fresh and delicious! It was so good I still think about this meal. We also tried the fried chicken sandwich (brunch BLAT) and what made it taste a step above anything else was the jalapeño bacon and honey aioli. American Social always has a great vibe with the music and atmosphere. We even got to sit outside and people watch as we ate and drank!\nJordan H. – ★★★★★\nTampa\n“I had a fantastic meal here, ribs for Lune, wagyu melt for me, and the drink was so good. I didn't post more Pictures because well Lune and I are out here living our best lives and sometimes it's hard to stop and whip out your phone. Staff at the outside bar was amazing and fun, had a great convo about all kinds of stuff and Lune was a hit people were going out of their way to pet him and that sparked conversations too. Had a great meal and will be back soon.”\nScott K. – ★★★★★\nLas Olas\nGreat happy hour, friendly staff, and beautiful location next to the Miami River in Brickell!!!\nHappy Hour is from 4-7pm Monday through Friday and they also have daily specials that are separate from the happy hour as well if you miss it.\nSitting outside is a must to get the views of the beautiful Miami river and scenery.\nThe staff were very friendly and outgoing from the time of arrival (hostess) to our bartender/server!\nMonday nights (after 7pm) they have $7 burgers and fries and discounted Bourbon/Whiskey (;\nP.S- They only have valet parking here so make sure to park in the meters or a parking garage near by!\nEmely R. – ★★★★★\nGive us a review",
