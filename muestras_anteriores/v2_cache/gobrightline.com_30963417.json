Brightline is the only privately owned and operated intercity railroad in the United States. We’re not here to brag, but that does mean we do things a bit differently.\nLife at Brightline\nRide Brighter.\nWe’re building easy, efficient, and eco-friendly routes between some of the country's best cities. With a focus on sustainability, it's a safer, greener way to travel and protect the environment. If you ask us, it's also a lot more fun. From in-station lounges complete with charcuterie to seamless transfers to get you from our stations to your door, we're making everyday travel a little bit better every day.\n2017\nBrightline was founded to create a solution for routes that are too long to drive, but too short to fly. We’ve also made it a priority to make sure every guest has some fun along the way.\n600+\nWe’re currently a team of over 600 thinkers and doers who all believe travel should be just as fun as it is functional. We’re not just about getting you from Point A to Point B—we do it with a smile.\nOver 5 Million\nWe’ve welcomed millions of passengers aboard since we opened our doors in South Florida, with service between Miami and West Palm Beach. And that’s just the start.\nExplore open roles\nDid you know?\nOur Teammates aren’t just building the future, they’re making it a greener one. So far, our team has planted over 3,000 native trees along our rail corridor to further reduce carbon emissions and help make the communities we serve greener, cleaner, and healthier.\nOur Impact\nThe Movers\nMeet the dream team.\nBuilding a brighter future takes a team of dreamers, thinkers, and doers. We’re proud of how far we’ve come, and every day we’re working towards a better tomorrow.\nExecutive Team\nMeet the Executive Team\nContact\nHelp Center\nAdvertise With Us\nPress Room\nSpeaker Request\nTravel Advisors\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nOur Impact\nRailroad\nRail Safety\nPolicies\nAccessibility\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nWi-Fi & Terms & Conditions/FAQs\nGift Cards\nGO SMARTER\nDownload the\nBrightline app\ntoday.\n© Brightline 2025.
