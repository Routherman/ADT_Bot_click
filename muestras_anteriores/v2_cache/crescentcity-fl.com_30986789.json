It also provides unrivaled recreation from world-class crappie and bass fishing to kayaking, swimming, and taking in the abundant wildlife.\nOur water surrounds us.\nThe same water has also shaped the people that have called us home.\nTools and pottery from Native Americans from thousands of years ago can be found on our shores and waterways, relics of our earliest settlements.\nLater residents came here to escape - people looking for a new life after the Civil War, northerners seeking a winter refuge, or newcomers simply seeking a slower pace of life.\nOur stories flow through us.\nWe have great stories here\n.\nSteamships were a common sight on Crescent Lake, bringing in settlers and visitors alike, and carrying our name out to the world.\nOur women's club, one of the oldest in the country, helped pave our streets and brought us our first library and movie theater.
