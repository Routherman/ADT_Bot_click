We love to learn and want to share our passion with others. Membership to the Dade City Garden Club is open to all regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, or religious affiliation.\nWe are always looking for new members who are interested in personal enrichment, preserving our heritage, and investing in the love of gardening.\nWhy Join?\nDo you love flowers and gardening and want to get to know others with your same interest?\nAre you new to the area and want to learn how to successfully garden in Central Florida?\nDo you wonder what would happen if no one cared about our rivers and springs, our wildlife, and trees?\nDo you hope today’s children grow up loving flowers, birds, bees, and butterflies, and our environment?\nThen you may just be the member we are looking for!\nBy joining the Dade City Garden Club. . .\n. . . You will attend interesting and varied meetings where you will expand your knowledge of gardening, the environment and floral design,\n. . .You will socialize with others with similar interests, exchange ideas, develop friendships,\n. . .You will discover what grows best in your kind of soil and how to fertilize and keep moisture in,\n. . .You will impact others by promoting the club’s programs encouraging young people to be curious about nature’s mysteries and careful about how they are used,\n. . .You will learn by doing while working with friends to maintain the beautiful gardens on the grounds of the garden club,\n. . .You will make a difference by getting together with others to present a solid front of civic concern to your city, county, and state representatives.\nJoin the Club\nThe Membership year runs from June 1st to May 31st. However, you can join at any time.\nMembership dues will be prorated from October thru May.\nYou can join the garden club either by joining a circle or joining as a member at large. All members, whether a member of a circle or a member at large, enjoy all the benefits and responsibilities of an active member of the Dade City Garden Club.\nDownload a\nMembership Application here\n.\nCircle Members\nThe club is made up of five circles: Azalea, Camellia, Hibiscus, Hollyhock, and Magnolia. The circles meet monthly from September through May on individual schedules. Camellia is the only circle which meets in the evening. The smaller group settings of circles allow members to pursue activities and topics of specific interest to the group. Before we had a clubhouse in which to meet, the circles were limited to a number that could be accommodated in a private home. Magnolia and Hollyhock accept new members by invitation only. The other three circles offer prospective members the option of attending circle meetings as a guest.\nMembers at Large\nIf you join as a member at large, you have no circle affiliation and therefore have no monthly circle meeting. You can join a circle at any time if you choose and take some time to get to know the personality of a circle by attending circle meetings as a guest. Since the circles range from active \"dig in the dirt\" gardeners to those more interested in floral design or field trips to gardens and related services, visits allow prospective members the ability to seek out others with common interests.\nAll Members Participate\nThe general club hosts bi-monthly general membership meetings with interesting topics which are open to the public. The general club hosts the Monarch Butterfly Festival annually, a Flower Show and “Uncorked in Dade City,” each on a biennual basis and sells a historical ornament each year. All these activities require the support of the entire club.\nUpon joining the club, contact information is entered into the club database and will be printed in the club’s annual Yearbook. Each member receives a subscription to the club’s monthly newsletter delivered by email.\nDues and Other Information\nAnnual dues are $70 which includes $45 toward common grounds maintenance and dues for state membership. Dade City Garden Club members become members of the National Garden Club and members of District VIII of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs and will receive the quarterly issues of the Florida Gardener Magazine.\nWe Hope to Meet you Soon\nOur general meetings are open to the public and we love to have visitors! Check our\nLatest News to see what's coming up. If you tell our Membership Vice President you are coming, we will save you a seat!\nFor more information, contact our Membership Vice President\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
