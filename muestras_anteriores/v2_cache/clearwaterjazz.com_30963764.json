The music festival has evolved from a series of concerts on the back of a flatbed truck and at venues around Clearwater into an annual, international, music festival that draws tens of thousands of visitors each year to beautiful Coachman Park in Clearwater, against the backdrop of the Gulf of Mexico, warm breezes, brilliant sunsets, and one of the world’s greatest beaches. The festival features a combination of legendary and relevant musical artists and a gathering of an amazingly diverse fan base. Over its 45-year history, a long and impressive list of legendary jazz talents have made stops in Clearwater such as Woody Herman, Buddy Rich, Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie Mann, Dave Brubeck, Tito Puente, Stephan Grappelli, Stan Getz, and the Count Basie Orchestra. The Jazz Holiday’s modern-day, diverse line-up covers a wide array of musical styles: straight ahead and smooth jazz, swing, blues, jamband, rock, folk, Americana, funk, and Zydeco and showcases a new generation of artists, emerging stars, and classic legends including Tony Bennett, Earth, Wind & Fire, Chicago, Bonnie Raitt, Trombone Shorty, The Avett Brothers, Brandi Carlile, Gov't Mule, Esperanza Spalding, Marcus Roberts, Mindi Abair, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Medeski, Martin & Wood, Soulive, Christian McBride, Bela Fleck, Boney James, Brian Culbertson, Spirit Family Reunion, Amos Lee, Lake Street Dive, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, Buddy Guy, Gladys Knight, Commodores, Kool & The Gang, UB40, Grace Potter, Sheryl Crow, Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins and the list goes on and on…. 45 years has shaped a unique magical and magnetic destination experience built on incredible community support. The true magic stems from those who built, shaped and implemented the experience, many of which share a multi-generational bond with it. The festival is organized and supported by the Clearwater Jazz Holiday Foundation. The Foundation’s dedicated and engaged Board of Directors is composed of community leaders, who oversee production of the festival and various innovative education and outreach initiatives.
