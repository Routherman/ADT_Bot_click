She said it was very delicious. It had carrots and peas, beef, and mashed potatoes. I had the French dip. The Ajou was awesome. The beef tasted a little old but overall the sandwich was well prepared. had had good flavor. The portion was generous. I got sweet potato fries to go with it and they were spectacular. Our server was Dane, like great Dane and Dane gave great service.\nScott Siewert\n02:01 22 Nov 23\nSnowbirding in the area got a tip to check out Clancys and glad we did.\nWhen we walked in bar area was full so we sat out on a table outside.\nServer came by right away very friendly, had a couple beers.\nI had the Fench dip Roast Beef and my wife The Reuben both were packed full of very very lean roast beef and lots of cheese \"very delish\".\nWe will return\nBryan Clapp\n15:25 13 Nov 23\n11/10/23 update. Stopped in for lunch and had the Italian Sub and French Dip. The French Dip was again, excellent! Juicy meat, soft bread and great au jus. Definitely a go to sandwich!\nStopped in as we were driving by and were starving. We walked in and were immediately greeted by Tana. We saw the back area, bar, stage, etc, and decided to sit outside. Lots of locals here. Tana was our server and is one of the best friendliest servers around! We ordered a couple drinks and decided on the Rueben and a French dip both with coleslaw. Everything was delicious and the owner, Rama, even stopped by, introduced herself and asked how we were doing. We will definitely be back!!!\nBillie Thompson-Romie\n19:32 18 Oct 23\nClancy is all about kickin back & having a great time! The food, drinks & ESPECIALLY the entertainment! With the right entertainment there’s standing room only & sooo much fun! There’s not a seat left in the house, it’s standing room only ( unless you’re out on the dance floor!)\nellen partal\n10:24 12 Oct 23\nWould I go back? Yes, in a heartbeat. The bar is large and area and the outside bar looked awesome. I sat inside and it was loud and the music was good. It could be too loud for some people.\nWe went to play Bingo with a big group of people and it was crowded. The parking looked like a used car lot there were so many cars. Plenty of parking for everyone though. They only had 2 wait staff and 1 bartender inside and one outside. Our waiters were drowning trying to keep up and they have Bingo and karaoke and live music all the time. Waiter forgot my drink and I had the nachos which were the wrong thing for me to order at a crowded table reaching over my bingo cards. The chips and beef were buried under a ton of lettuce, cheese and sour cream. The gal next to me had the Clancy's Rolls and they were really good.\nThe guy calling bingo had a great voice. He called the numbers very differently than anywhere I have been and it missed a couple of number because of the inconsistency.",

She said it was very delicious. It had carrots and peas, beef, and mashed potatoes. I had the French dip. The Ajou was awesome. The beef tasted a little old but overall the sandwich was well prepared. had had good flavor. The portion was generous. I got sweet potato fries to go with it and they were spectacular. Our server was Dane, like great Dane and Dane gave great service.\nScott Siewert\n02:01 22 Nov 23\nSnowbirding in the area got a tip to check out Clancys and glad we did.\nWhen we walked in bar area was full so we sat out on a table outside.\nServer came by right away very friendly, had a couple beers.\nI had the Fench dip Roast Beef and my wife The Reuben both were packed full of very very lean roast beef and lots of cheese \"very delish\".\nWe will return\nBryan Clapp\n15:25 13 Nov 23\n11/10/23 update. Stopped in for lunch and had the Italian Sub and French Dip. The French Dip was again, excellent! Juicy meat, soft bread and great au jus. Definitely a go to sandwich!\nStopped in as we were driving by and were starving. We walked in and were immediately greeted by Tana. We saw the back area, bar, stage, etc, and decided to sit outside. Lots of locals here. Tana was our server and is one of the best friendliest servers around! We ordered a couple drinks and decided on the Rueben and a French dip both with coleslaw. Everything was delicious and the owner, Rama, even stopped by, introduced herself and asked how we were doing. We will definitely be back!!!\nBillie Thompson-Romie\n19:32 18 Oct 23\nClancy is all about kickin back & having a great time! The food, drinks & ESPECIALLY the entertainment! With the right entertainment there’s standing room only & sooo much fun! There’s not a seat left in the house, it’s standing room only ( unless you’re out on the dance floor!)\nellen partal\n10:24 12 Oct 23\nWould I go back? Yes, in a heartbeat. The bar is large and area and the outside bar looked awesome. I sat inside and it was loud and the music was good. It could be too loud for some people.\nWe went to play Bingo with a big group of people and it was crowded. The parking looked like a used car lot there were so many cars. Plenty of parking for everyone though. They only had 2 wait staff and 1 bartender inside and one outside. Our waiters were drowning trying to keep up and they have Bingo and karaoke and live music all the time. Waiter forgot my drink and I had the nachos which were the wrong thing for me to order at a crowded table reaching over my bingo cards. The chips and beef were buried under a ton of lettuce, cheese and sour cream. The gal next to me had the Clancy's Rolls and they were really good.\nThe guy calling bingo had a great voice. He called the numbers very differently than anywhere I have been and it missed a couple of number because of the inconsistency.\n42 events found.\nEvents Search and Views Navigation\nSearch\nEnter Keyword.

She said it was very delicious. It had carrots and peas, beef, and mashed potatoes. I had the French dip. The Ajou was awesome. The beef tasted a little old but overall the sandwich was well prepared. had had good flavor. The portion was generous. I got sweet potato fries to go with it and they were spectacular. Our server was Dane, like great Dane and Dane gave great service.\nScott Siewert\n02:01 22 Nov 23\nSnowbirding in the area got a tip to check out Clancys and glad we did.\nWhen we walked in bar area was full so we sat out on a table outside.\nServer came by right away very friendly, had a couple beers.\nI had the Fench dip Roast Beef and my wife The Reuben both were packed full of very very lean roast beef and lots of cheese \"very delish\".\nWe will return\nBryan Clapp\n15:25 13 Nov 23\n11/10/23 update. Stopped in for lunch and had the Italian Sub and French Dip. The French Dip was again, excellent! Juicy meat, soft bread and great au jus. Definitely a go to sandwich!\nStopped in as we were driving by and were starving. We walked in and were immediately greeted by Tana. We saw the back area, bar, stage, etc, and decided to sit outside. Lots of locals here. Tana was our server and is one of the best friendliest servers around! We ordered a couple drinks and decided on the Rueben and a French dip both with coleslaw. Everything was delicious and the owner, Rama, even stopped by, introduced herself and asked how we were doing. We will definitely be back!!!\nBillie Thompson-Romie\n19:32 18 Oct 23\nClancy is all about kickin back & having a great time! The food, drinks & ESPECIALLY the entertainment! With the right entertainment there’s standing room only & sooo much fun! There’s not a seat left in the house, it’s standing room only ( unless you’re out on the dance floor!)\nellen partal\n10:24 12 Oct 23\nWould I go back? Yes, in a heartbeat. The bar is large and area and the outside bar looked awesome. I sat inside and it was loud and the music was good. It could be too loud for some people.\nWe went to play Bingo with a big group of people and it was crowded. The parking looked like a used car lot there were so many cars. Plenty of parking for everyone though. They only had 2 wait staff and 1 bartender inside and one outside. Our waiters were drowning trying to keep up and they have Bingo and karaoke and live music all the time. Waiter forgot my drink and I had the nachos which were the wrong thing for me to order at a crowded table reaching over my bingo cards. The chips and beef were buried under a ton of lettuce, cheese and sour cream. The gal next to me had the Clancy's Rolls and they were really good.\nThe guy calling bingo had a great voice. He called the numbers very differently than anywhere I have been and it missed a couple of number because of the inconsistency.\n42 events found.\nEvents Search and Views Navigation\nSearch\nEnter Keyword.

She said it was very delicious. It had carrots and peas, beef, and mashed potatoes. I had the French dip. The Ajou was awesome. The beef tasted a little old but overall the sandwich was well prepared. had had good flavor. The portion was generous. I got sweet potato fries to go with it and they were spectacular. Our server was Dane, like great Dane and Dane gave great service.\nScott Siewert\n02:01 22 Nov 23\nSnowbirding in the area got a tip to check out Clancys and glad we did.\nWhen we walked in bar area was full so we sat out on a table outside.\nServer came by right away very friendly, had a couple beers.\nI had the Fench dip Roast Beef and my wife The Reuben both were packed full of very very lean roast beef and lots of cheese \"very delish\".\nWe will return\nBryan Clapp\n15:25 13 Nov 23\n11/10/23 update. Stopped in for lunch and had the Italian Sub and French Dip. The French Dip was again, excellent! Juicy meat, soft bread and great au jus. Definitely a go to sandwich!\nStopped in as we were driving by and were starving. We walked in and were immediately greeted by Tana. We saw the back area, bar, stage, etc, and decided to sit outside. Lots of locals here. Tana was our server and is one of the best friendliest servers around! We ordered a couple drinks and decided on the Rueben and a French dip both with coleslaw. Everything was delicious and the owner, Rama, even stopped by, introduced herself and asked how we were doing. We will definitely be back!!!\nBillie Thompson-Romie\n19:32 18 Oct 23\nClancy is all about kickin back & having a great time! The food, drinks & ESPECIALLY the entertainment! With the right entertainment there’s standing room only & sooo much fun! There’s not a seat left in the house, it’s standing room only ( unless you’re out on the dance floor!)\nellen partal\n10:24 12 Oct 23\nWould I go back? Yes, in a heartbeat. The bar is large and area and the outside bar looked awesome. I sat inside and it was loud and the music was good. It could be too loud for some people.\nWe went to play Bingo with a big group of people and it was crowded. The parking looked like a used car lot there were so many cars. Plenty of parking for everyone though. They only had 2 wait staff and 1 bartender inside and one outside. Our waiters were drowning trying to keep up and they have Bingo and karaoke and live music all the time. Waiter forgot my drink and I had the nachos which were the wrong thing for me to order at a crowded table reaching over my bingo cards. The chips and beef were buried under a ton of lettuce, cheese and sour cream. The gal next to me had the Clancy's Rolls and they were really good.\nThe guy calling bingo had a great voice. He called the numbers very differently than anywhere I have been and it missed a couple of number because of the inconsistency.",
