Over 3 million acres of land located in 22 National Recreation Areas managed by the Forest Service is preserved for recreational activities like hiking, boating, fishing and swimming, while highlighting natural, cultural and scenic resources. Visitors who choose to recreate on these public lands find 162,984 miles of trails, over 30,000 recreation sites, over 400,000 miles of streams and 3 million acres of lakes, 127 alpine ski areas, 338,000 heritage sites, and specially designated sites that include 36.7 million acres of designated wilderness areas, 130 wild and scenic rivers, 12 monuments, and one preserve. And remember, “It’s All Yours.”\nEach National Forest unit is managed by a local team. As conditions, rules and regulations on each forest are likely to be different, contacting the forest directly is your best resource for local information:\nFind a Forest Tool\nForest and Grassland Websites by State\nInteractive Visitor Map\nNational Monuments Managed but the USDA Forest Service\nSpecial Destinations to Visit and Explore\nFor national programs, please review our\nlist of national offices\n.\nFire and Smoke\nThe Forest Service has been managing wildland fire on National Forests and Grasslands for more than 100 years.

Both state and federal laws apply on National Forest System lands, so you need to check on the state laws and county ordinances which may apply to the area you will be visiting. You also need to follow any general federal laws and regulations about weapons (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, (\nhttps://www.atf.gov/\n).\nBefore you visit,\ncontact the local Forest Service district or forest office\n, as they are more aware of local ranges, local orders and restrictions, issues and special conditions that may affect you.
