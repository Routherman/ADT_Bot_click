After graduation, I held positions at a number of high-profile restaurants and hotels in New York City, including the Stanhope Hotel, the 3 star French restaurant La Reserve and The Essex House Hotel. Now I am happily rooted in Florida as the Executive Chef at Woodfield.\nParty Planning Words of Wisdom:\nAnything is possible!

During college, I worked as an intern at a planning agency. After I moved to the United States, I entered the hotel world and worked at Marriott for over 9 years.
