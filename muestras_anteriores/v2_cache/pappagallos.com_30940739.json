      "text": "About\nPappagallo’s in Satellite Beach caters to the modern family that wants a quality, made to order dining experience and not just a quick, stamped out, drive-thru meal. We are committed to over-delivering in customer service and serving incredible tasting food. We also help grow relationships by donating to local schools and area youth sports teams.\nFamily recipes from our table to yours.\nWe do business a little bit differently by showing customers their hand tossed Pizza as entertainment, backing our made to order style. All dough and bread is made daily in-house. Our difference is our ability to customize any meal according to guest request\nNOW THERE ARE MORE REASONS TO CHOOSE Pappagallo’s:\nQuality, made to order dining experience.\nBig Portions for a low price.\nWe’re cool that way.\nAfter working in a family restaurant in Cape Canaveral in 1981. Dave wanted to open his own location.\nIn 1990 Dave Rich branched off to begin his own restaurant in Indian Harbour Beach, where it got a little too hot.\nAfter this location burnt down, we moved across from the Hilton in Indialantic. We also made some awesome smoothies at Blenders, in Indialantic. Then eventually hopped mainland for a little taste of Palm Bay serving Breakfast Lunch and Dinner.\nMoved the Indialantic location to sweet Satellite Beach. We are located at 1769 Highway A1A (in the Seaside Plaza with Morning Glory Eatery and Balsa Bills).\nWe provide a laid back family atmosphere with Italian-American food You won’t be let down. That’s a promise. We are helping you “Save Some Dough” with ongoing Daily specials. Watch the Pizza guy spin dough, Watch the bartenders create handcrafted cocktails, and enjoy the big screen HDTVs.\nWe feed every event and occasion like only Italians Can…\nFinish line or Deadline? We eat.\nVictorious or Defeated? We eat.\nSideline or Center stage? We eat.\nCelebrating or Mourning? We eat.\nThe Ocean view patio is a great spot to enjoy a meal with a view. A huge Sliding glass door brings the beach and patio to the inside. Allowing our guest to enjoy the view of beautiful Satellite beaches and the bartenders inside and out.\nJoin us on Facebook and Instagram to see what’s on special daily.\nWe look forward to serving you!\n~The Pappagallo’s Crew\nIn beautiful Satellite Beach, FL",
