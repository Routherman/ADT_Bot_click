A quiet fishing village that exudes Old Florida charm, Cedar Key is one of several barrier islands off the Gulf Coast and remains unspoiled by the commercialism of the tourism industry. In Cedar Key you will fall in love with the natural beauty and friendly faces that make up the laid back community.\nThe friendly, laid back culture of the island matches perfectly with the feeling you get when you arrive at Pirates Cove. Brian and Lisa purchased Pirates Cove in 2018 and are intent on it remaining a family owned and operated business. It will always remain the same beloved Old Florida retreat, and as Lisa and Brian add their own personal touches you will continue to see their love of the area reflected in the property.\nAt Pirates Cove you will enjoy beautiful sunrises over the bay.  Each cottage is equipped to make your stay feel like a home away from home.\nAll guests are welcome to bring kayaks to explore the mangrove islands right from our dock.\nTide depending, you can fish off of our dock and since our cottages offer kitchens, outdoor grills, as well as fish cleaning stations, you can clean and prepare your catch for the freshest seafood meal on the island.  We are also a short stroll to the unique shops and chef-inspired restaurants of Cedar Key.\nBrian & Lisa Barrett\nPirates Cove Owners\nWhen owners Brian and Lisa were ready to escape the hustle and bustle of life in Atlanta they knew exactly where to find the slower paced lifestyle they were craving. As their children were getting older, Lisa and Brian decided to fully embrace their new stage in life. It was time to leave the city behind and refocus on time together as a family. Cedar Key was the obvious choice; they had been visiting the island for over twenty years and were excited to make it their home.\nHave questions?
