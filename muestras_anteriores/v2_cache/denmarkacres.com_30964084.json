      "text": "Welcome! We’re Todd and Tammy Denmark, owners and operators of Denmark Acres, LLC.\nWe are excited to formally introduce ourselves and share the story behind our Old West Town, Ravens’s Hollow! Back in October 1990, Todd began crafting a small cemetery called Restless Slumber in his parents’ front yard, attracting hundreds who came to marvel at his spooky creations. After starting careers and raising families, we decided to pause our project while still dreaming and planning how to incorporate Restless Slumber Cemetery into our future. It wasn’t until our children grew up that we finally decided to bring our plans to life!\nUsing all our savings and gathering as many free materials as possible, we built a drive-through cemetery. With the support of family and friends, we proudly opened our Drive Thru in 2021.\nDue to long lines and traffic issues on our road, we chose to transform Restless Slumber Cemetery into an Old West town, providing families with a place to walk around and enjoy various activities!\nAfter countless sketches on dinner napkins and extensive planning, we constructed Ravens Hollow in our parents’ back field, funded by the earnings from our Drive Thru.\nConstruction began with a ticket booth and a small jail, followed by Todd’s dad, Chuck, who installed electricity throughout the park. Further enhancements included a general store, a mining company, an Undertaker facade, a playground, a wooden stage, and fencing around the park.\nThanks to our incredible food trucks and vendors who took a chance on us, along with the help of our friends and family, we held our very first Fall Festival in October 2022. The level of community support was truly overwhelming!\nIt is because of all of you that we have been able to expand. We added to the General Store, where visitors can shop for antiques, gifts, homemade baked goods, nostalgic candy, and more. Todd’s aunt, Frankie Sue, built a Livery stable to house animals for our petting zoo. We also implemented irrigation to grow our maze and sunflowers for our annual fall festival.\nLooking ahead, we hope to invite schools and daycares during the week to teach children about gardening and life in the 1800s.\nWe have grand ambitions, but with a limited budget, we are taking small steps to develop our town season by season. Although it requires a lot of hard work, seeing family and friends create lasting memories together makes it all worthwhile.\nThank you to everyone who continues to support us! We wouldn’t be here without all of you, as well as our family and friends!\nPhoto by\nHolly Frazier Photography\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nPinterest\n.entry-content\n#post-2564\nWelcome!
