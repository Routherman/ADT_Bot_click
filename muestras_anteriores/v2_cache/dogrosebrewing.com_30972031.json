Our handcrafted ales and lagers are brewed with style and tradition in mind. Whether it be a German styled Hefeweizen or Maibock to a fruited sour or West Coast IPA, only the best ingredients are used to capture the flavor profile we’re looking for. The tap room is at once, spacious and open, yet cozy and inviting while leaving the brewery itself easily accessible. If bellying up at our handcrafted Ambrosia maple bar isn’t your thing, then maybe a friendly game of shuffleboard on one of our 16’ tables or even a game of cricket on our professional dart boards is more your speed. With 5,000 SF of space, there is more than enough room to spread out with all your friends.\nAbout\nScroll Down to Content\nDog Rose Brewing Co. opened its doors in Oct. of 2017 in the historic neighborhood of Lincolnville, mere blocks from the center of the historic district of St. Augustine.
