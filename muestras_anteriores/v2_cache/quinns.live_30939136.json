If you're willing to part with 50 cents, we have arcade and other bar games, and a jukebox. On high volume nights like New Years Eve, Paddy's Day, and Quinnsgiving, we have an outdoor patio open for bands and large screen viewing.\nWe're open every day until 3am, to welcome all the service industry pros when they get off work from the beaches. The kitchen is open with hot food available all night long.\nCome to Quinn's & hang out with all your friends. Raise your hands, move your feet, lift your voice.\nWe're Open:\nMon-Wed 3pm-3am\nThur-Sat 11am-3am\nSun 11am-3am\nLEGEND OF THE WHITE HAND:\n``Why is there a plaster white hand on the wall by the door as you're leaving Quinn's?``\nIn Irish folklore, the white hand is a symbol used to keep the banshees away from your door. In the early 1900's the Irish ``white hand`` gang ran Al Capone out of New York and off to Chicago. At Quinn's, it does keep evil from the door. It doesn't stop Spectrum TV from continuing to try to bill us for two accounts... but REAL evil, it stops. Regulars sometimes high-five it. That may bring good luck - give it a try.\nOur Story\nMickey Quinn's opened in Seminole in 2003, and three generations have been coming here since to eat and drink, spend time with friends, listen to live local music, and enjoy fantastic and authentic Irish food.\nWe're named after Mickey Quinn, the Irish rugby player, whose sister Margaret first opened the pub in 2003, and whose recipes are the core of our original menu.\nQuinn's is known for amazing food, a talented and fun bartenders, and live music every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, with open mic nights every Tuesday, 'living room' jam nights, trivia Mondays, late night karaoke on Thursdays (ladies night on Thursday too with killer drink pricing for the lassies.)\nIndoors we have a music hall with a stage, 17 huge TV's, steel tip darts no charge to play, shuffleboard, foosball, all at no charge to play.
