These guys bust their humps every day to give you the service that you deserve. They’re slowing down a bit, so try not to be so hard on these fellas., They’re here to help\nEdwin Wantsome\nConsumate golf professional.\nAbout\nEdwin came to us via the northern Costa Rican senior tour, where he capped his final season off with his first and only major tour victory. Having finally captured the fabled green sombrero and after a celebratory drunken binge, Edwin stole away passage in the hold of a freighter transporting a load of rotten bananas to the Port of Manatee. He evaded capture with some stealthy moves and found himself at our door.  His style and brand of expertise is a welcome addition to our team, Even though he wears everybody thin with his constant muttering about some crazy ass British Open fantasy dream that he has. Please,  just humor him, he actually knows a lot about the game of golf. You might learn something.\nExperience\nPlayed a few tournaments. Had some success. Singer of sentimental ballads in his spare time.\nHobbies\nBackyard grilling, needlepoint,saying “Heh”\nsales@foresomesports.com\n(941) 794-2345\nDick Sonbawles\nPro shop troll that loves to change grips, just to smell the solvent.\nAbout this Team Member\nDick seems to always be lurking nearby, ready to change a grip at a moments notice.  His speed and tenacity at removing old tape has made him a bit of a sentimental favorite.  Ask him to show you his famous fireball of grip solvent trick.  Just remind him to do it outside this time, and keep your facial hair at least five feet away from him! Hard to believe that he has managed to keep his own beard this long…probably uses the same Vaseline that he puts on his driver during scrambles and other club matches.\nExperience\nAbsolutely none, sorry.\nA large box located on the left side of the I-75 underpass, down by the river\nsales@foresomesports.com\ndisconnected. Yell real loud!\nPar Lord from a Golf Galaxy Far, Far, Away\nTeaching Professional that specializes in the Laser method.\nAbout this Team Member\nWe found Par Lord walking in the median across from the shop one afternoon. He said he was working for the Golf Smith store in Sarasota. Apparently after saving the world (yeah sure), I mean universe, LOL., he returned to discover that not only had the name changed on the place he thought worked, the new people in charge were a bunch of peckers. He was so disturbed he charted a course across the universe, but his ship blew out the flux capacitor and crash landed near our location. After we brought him in to get out of the sun, we realized this guy has some earth shattering talents and his laser method of eviscerating a golf ball could come in handy. If you sign up for lessons, you simply have to ask him to go over the GROOT (Greens Really Offer Outstanding Traction) theory of approaching greens. He seems happy here, we promised not to change the name!\nExperience\nPlayed a few tournaments. Had some success. May or may Not have been a villian at the end of his last mission.\nHobbies\nLoves a good mix tape, Enjoys speeding through the Universe\nsales@foresomesports.com\n(941) 794-2345\nDolf Smithe\nCustomer Service Representative.\nAbout this Team Member\nGood luck trying to return those shoes you wore for a month of Sundays with this guy at the helm.  He has been known to have a bit of a temper, so it’s always better that you keep your cool around him.  He has really turned around his putting game lately, so if you ask him some questions about it, he would probably be happy to throw you a tip or two to drop your scores. Whatever it is, it sure seems to be working for him, unless its is just from having his girlfriend on the bag.\nExperience\nHe has been at this all of his life.\nSomewhere in Spain\nsales@foresomesports.com\n1.800.spit in cup\n8104 Cortez Rd.\nBradenton, FL 34210\n(941) 794-2345\n© 2024 Fore Some Sports\nThe Carousel Swiper\nThe main close buton\nImage info, comments and meta\nLoading Comments...\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail\nName\nWebsite",
