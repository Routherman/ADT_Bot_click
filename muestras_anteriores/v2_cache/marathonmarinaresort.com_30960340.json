The staff is extremely attentive and helpful. The facilities were clean and well maintained.  The pool was outstanding with lots of high-class furniture. Tikis and gathering areas throughout. This location also had a travel lift to address any problems as a boater. A+++. Thank you for a perfect stay. I will visit again.\nShow Less\nDavid Steeves\n1 year ago\nSpent 10 days at Safe Harbor Marathon in May of 2024. Beautiful Marina, very clean and very helpful folks who work there.
