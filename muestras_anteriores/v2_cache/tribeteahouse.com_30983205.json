      "text": "Two Locations:\nKenneth City, Florida & Largo, Florida\nAbout Us\nThe Tribe Story\nThe story of Tribe began with a transformative discovery of plant-based alternatives, leading to a deep dive into the kava bar scene across the U.S. The vision was clear: to create a space where people could unwind and enjoy unique, plant-inspired drinks in a relaxed, Tulum-inspired atmosphere.\nFrom this vision, Tribe Tea House & Kava Bar was born. What started as an idea has grown into two fullr-scale kava bars in Kenneth City and Largo, Florida. Tribe offers more than just beverages; it’s a welcoming community where people come together, share ideas, and work toward their goals.\nOur Products\nPremium Imported Kava & Botanicals & locally sourced coffee & teas\nTribe takes pride in the quality of our wide variety of products. We enjoy bringing together products from all over the globe and local to the Tampa Bay region to create a unique menu experience for all our customers to enjoy!\nKava\nOur Kava is carefully sourced directly from Vanuatu, an island in the South Pacific. Kava has an earthy flavor and a mouth-numbing sensation. We drink it to relax and feel a euphoric buzz. It’s known to help reduce stress and anxiety.\nHerbal & Botanical Teas\nAre you a tea lover? If so, you'll love the vast selection of herbal and botanical teas available at Tribe Tea House. Whether you crave a chai latte to start your day, a soothing chamomile to unwind at night, or our refreshing on-tap blue lotus tea, we have something to satisfy your tea cravings.\nCoffee\nTribe Tea House loves to support local business! Caracolillo Coffee Mills roasts all of our coffee right here in Tampa Bay and is immediately delivered for brewing in both of our locations. Whether you are looking for an espresso-based latte, nitro cold brew, or a simple cup of french-press coffee – Tribe has you covered! We offer both dairy or non-dairy options with endless flavors to spice up your latte.\nHave questions?

The Tribe crew provide top notch friendly service. The space has a calming vibe with plenty of greenery and a central tree that covers the main bar. You can’t go wrong here!\n- Ean Sugarman\nThe last few weeks I started coming to this Tribe almost every other day and I love it. It’s relaxing and cozy! The kava tenders are wonderful and very much like the other tribe the products are always great.\n- L Mc\nTribe tea house quickly became like a second home to me when I moved to FL. The best tea in  St. Pete in my opinion. The atmosphere sets a peaceful uplifting vibe while the employees treat you just like family.    I am happy to be apart of the Tribe community and plan to come here as long as I’m here.\n- Mica Tillman\nTribe Walsingham is top tier when it comes to atmosphere, drinks, and a sense of community. It’s hard to find another kava bar as well put together as this one folks. One of the best in the region, and that’s saying something, in what is one of the largest kava scenes in the continental united states.\n- Dominic Soto\nCome Visit Us\nCheck Out What's New at the Tea House\nEvents\nCopyright © 2025 Tribe Tea House\nPrivacy Policy\nWebsite Design by\nHang Ten Agency\nWebsite Content & Copy by\nNew Society Media",
