As part of this commitment, we’re working to replace aging lead and galvanized water service lines across town. This initiative is in response to a nation-wide federal mandate and aligns with our dedication to the health and safety of our community.\nTo expedite Dundee’s compliance with the LCRR, the Town has launched the Pipe Inventory Program. The program will help ensure that our customers have the resources they need to understand the LCRR and are clear on any action they may need to take.\nOur Lead Service Line Replacement Program is designed to:\nService Line Inventory:\nWe’re auditing service lines to determine the presence of any lead components.\nReplacement Process:\nIdentified lead service lines will be replaced promptly.\nPrivate-Side Galvanized Lines:\nTown will support property owners in identifying and addressing galvanized lines (which can absorb lead over time), if needed on private property.\nRegulatory Compliance:\nEnsure compliance with\nEPA’s Revised Lead and Copper Rule\n, provide transparency to the process, and keep Dundee ahead of the mandated schedule.\nA\nservice line\nis the underground pipe that connects your home to the water main, delivering water to faucets, bathtubs, showers, and other water outlets inside the home. A service line can typically be seen connected to the water meter outside the home and has a utility owned side as well as customer owned portion, as illustrated in the graphic below.\nThe use of lead in construction in the water industry was a common practice but was stopped in 1989 when the EPA prohibited the use of lead in water systems. This will help ensure the highest quality water for your home and the Dundee community.\nThe water provided to residents by the Town of Dundee does not contain lead when it leaves our water treatment facilities and has a carefully balanced pH to prevent corroding distribution pipes and plumbing. The latest water quality report can be found\nhere\n.\nAs part of compliance with the LCRR regulations, service line material information is provided to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Every customer service line has a location identifier in our inventory database, which is also being developed through the Pipe Inventory Map. If you receive drinking water as a customer of the Town of Dundee Utilities, you will be able to find this information later by visiting our webpage townofdundee.com/aboututilities or call 863.438.8330.  Please note if you are on a private well or receive drinking water from a different utility, your pipe material is not included in the City’s inventory.\nImportant Information About Lead in Drinking Water\nDrinking water sources do not typically have naturally occurring lead. Instead, certain types of plumbing materials that transport drinking water to homes and businesses can deposit lead into the water. These plumbing materials include older service lines, faucets, and other fixtures.  It is possible for lead to enter drinking water because of corrosion caused by the wearing of pipes, or from residential plumbing fixtures containing lead. This includes lead or lead-based solder used to join copper pipe, brass, and chrome-plated brass faucets. When present, lead service lines are typically the most significant source of lead in the water.\nThe Health Effects of Lead\nExposure to lead in drinking water can cause serious health effects in all age groups. Infants and children can have decreases in IQ and attention span. Lead exposure can lead to new learning and behavior problems or exacerbate existing learning and behavior problems. The children of women who are exposed to lead before or during pregnancy can have an increased risk of these adverse health effects. Adults can have increased risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney, or nervous system problems.\nLearn more about preventing childhood lead poisoning at\ncdc.gov/lead\n.\nSources of Lead\nLead is a common metal found in the environment. Most sources result from human activities. Some of the most common sources of lead are:\nLead-based paint\nLead-contaminated dust or soil\nPottery, pewter, and brass fixtures\nPlumbing materials containing lead\nFood\nCosmetics\nLead on clothing or shoes carried from work areas or certain hobbies\nToys, playground equipment, and children’s metal jewelry\nLead Leaching Factors\nWhen tap water stays in contact with plumbing materials containing lead for an extended amount of time, lead has a greater opportunity to leach out of the pipe or fixture into the drinking water. This means that standing water in the pipe drawn from the tap after several hours without use, such as in the morning or later in the afternoon, may contain higher levels of lead than water that has been continuously flushed through the pipe throughout the day.\nLead Reduction Steps\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) establish specific monitoring, testing, and reporting requirements to address health risks from lead exposure in drinking water. To comply with the LCRR, the Town of Dundee is developing an inventory of customer water service lines.\nConcerned customers can follow the tips below for additional protection from the potential for lead in drinking water:\nRun water to flush pipes:\nIf a tap has been unused for several hours, flush the water for several minutes before using it for drinking or cooking. To avoid wasting water, capture and reuse the flushed water for irrigation, cleaning, etc.\nUse only cold water for cooking, drinking, and preparing baby formula. If hot water is needed, collect cold water after flushing and then heat it up. Boiling water does not reduce or remove lead.\nFilter your water:\nFor drinking, cooking, and baby formula, use water that has been run through a filter. Filters should be certified by an American National Standards Institute, like the NSF 53 for lead removal and NSF 42 for particulate removal. Maintain and replace the filter device in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions to protect water quality.\nClean aerators:\nAerators and/or screens on faucets should be cleaned periodically (every 3-6 months) and more often if there has been a service line replacement (every month for six months). Aerators should be replaced if damaged or worn out.\nIdentify and replace plumbing fixtures containing lead:\nBrass faucets, fittings, and valves, including those advertised as “lead-free,” may contribute to lead in drinking water. Current regulations have established a maximum lead concentration of 0.25 percent for drinking water fixtures. Visit the NSF website at\nwww.nsf.org\nto learn more about lead-containing plumbing fixtures.\nWhy would a line on private property need to be replaced?\nA line replacement on the property side of the meter is necessary if:\nLead service lines from the water main to the meter are confirmed and replaced by City staff, and\nLead or galvanized lines exist on the property side of the meter.\nNote\n: Galvanized lines can absorb lead from lead service lines and must be replaced after the city-owned line is replaced.\nWhat needs to be replaced on the private property side?\nIf notified to replace the line on your property, the replacement should start from the meter to the home’s foundation, typically connected at the main shut-off valve.\nWhat do I Need to Do?\nIf your line is identified for replacement, don’t worry – we’ll handle most of the work. Here’s what happens next:\nStep One: Check the Service Line on the Private Property Side\nAs a property owner or res5330ident, you are responsible for maintaining the portion of the service line that runs from the water meter to your home or building. This is called the customer service line. The EPA recommends homeowners inspect the service line. Any lead or galvanized pipe or components found should be replaced by the property owner. A licensed plumber can assist with both the inspection and pipe replacement.\nPlease note, the cost of replacing the customer service line is the responsibility of the property owner.\nStep Two: Flush Your System\nNow that the water service line has been replaced, it’s important to flush your water system to remove any particles that may have entered your plumbing during the replacement.\nFor more information on reducing lead exposure and the health effects of lead, visit the EPA website at\nwww.epa.gov/lead\n, or contact your health care provider.\nIf you have any questions or require further assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re here to help ensure that your water remains safe and clean. For additional information on the nationwide effort to remove lead components from water systems, please visit the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) website at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/revised-lead-and-copper-rule\n.\nTracy Mercer\nPublic Utilities & Special Projects Director",
