It will take you straight down to the Keys or up to Miami.  If you’d prefer not to drive, bus service – all the way down to Key West – is both convenient and reasonably priced.\nAMENITIES & NEARBY ATTRACTIONS\nDubbed the ‘Fishing Capital of the United States,’ this cozy corner of Florida definitely validates that accolade.  Besides great fishing, the area offers emerald green golf courses, white sand beaches and a treasure trove of natural and man made wonders.  Our area also offers plenty of shopping choices such as the Florida Keys Outlet Center.\nDuring your stay with us, we encourage you to check out our amenities including:\nGENERAL STORE\nOur general store opened in August 2015 and is located inside of our office.  We offer: candy, snacks, drinks, Hershey’s Ice Cream, toiletries, medicine, basic need items, gifts, toys and RV, household, fishing, pool and other general supplies.\nTHE CLUBHOUSE\nA spacious air conditioned building features ceramic tile floors, restrooms and a functional service kitchen for dinners, parties, etc. The clubhouse is equipped with tables and chairs for 100+ guests, plus adjoining poolside patio facilities.  Nearby the clubhouse, next to the horseshoe pit is a grilling area with three grills and picnic tables.\nBILLIARD ROOM & LIBRARY\nIn a separate room within the clubhouse, you’ll find two pool tables and a small ‘rotating’ library, where guests can share their favorite books, games & other media.\nHEATED SWIMMING POOL\nNext to the clubhouse is our professionally maintained pool. At 84 degrees, it’s comfortable year-round and is plenty large enough to swim laps. Tables, chairs and lounges offer the choice of sunbathing or snoozing in the shade. Guests are encouraged to bring a picnic and make a day of it. And what better way to enjoy a sunny day in Florida?! And, of course, it’s always a fine place to throw a party.\nFITNESS CENTER\nair-conditioned, perfect area for an everyday work out session, currently equipped with a bench press, treadmill, gazelle machine, stationary exercise bike, elliptical, multi-function pull up station\nOTHER AMENITIES\nlaundry-card operated (inquire in office- $) laundry facility, clean bathrooms/showers, sand volleyball / petanque court, bean-bag toss area, shuffleboard courts, grass horseshoe area, common areas equipped with BBQ grills and picnic tables, picnic tables are also on every site\nWhatever the order of the day – relaxation, exercise or just plain old everyday chores – you’ll find it convenient and easy to achieve here at the Boardwalk!\n.entry-content\n#post-##\n/main\n#main\nMAKE RESERVATIONS ONLINE\n<b>Click here to<br />Reserve</b>\nRESERVE NOW\nContact Us\nSidebar Contact Form\n\"\n*\n\" indicates required fields\nName\n*\nPhone\n*\nEmail\n*\nMessage...\n*\nComments\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nMAKE RESERVATIONS ONLINE\nReserve Now\n#middle\nAbout Us\n.entry-header\nABOUT US\nThe Boardwalk RV Resort is a gated community comprised of 145 back-in, full hookup RV sites and several ‘overflow’ sites for special events and seasons of peak traffic.  We accommodate RV reservations for any length of stay 1 night to 1 year or longer!  For those needing a more permanent option, we also have 165 manufactured homes, all of which are privately owned.  If you are interested in purchasing a home within our community please inquire within the office first.\nLOCATION\nWe are conveniently located in Homestead, Florida, gateway to the Florida Keys – the southernmost stretch of the United States.  We’re so far south that Miami is 30 minutes north!  Key Largo is about 20 minutes south of us and the Everglades about 20 minutes west and Biscayne Bay – a favorite launching site for fishermen – is closer yet.\nBeing just one block east of U.S. 1 – on lightly traveled NE 6th Avenue – we’re easily accessible.  Should you feel the urge to explore, just jump back on U.S. 1.
