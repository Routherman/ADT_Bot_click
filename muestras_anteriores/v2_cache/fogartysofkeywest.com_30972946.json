He hosts parties for Henry Flagler, William Howard Taft, and Grover Cleveland.\n2001\nFogarty’s Restaurant opens to the public. Captain Outrageous paints his iconic mural at the Flying Monkeys bar. The first Red Party kicks off during Fantasy Fest with proceeds benefiting local education.\nThe Red Party\nFor over 20 years, we have hosted Fantasy Fest’s best party, the Red Party. The proceeds from this event go to supporting local education: for many years, the money went directly to the Monroe County School System. Later, it was gifted in the form of college scholarship for some of our brightest graduating seniors.\nRecently, the Red Party isn’t as big as it used to be.
