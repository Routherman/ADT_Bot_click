      "text": "About Us\nThe Greater Dunnellon Historical Society was formed in 1986 by a group of area women who were concerned about preserving the history of the town. They made those plans from the porch of the original Gingerbread House on Chestnut Street, which has since burned. The society began meeting at the old railroad depot, and the building was purchased by the society in 1992 after J. Phil Felburn donated $40,000 toward the mortgage.\nThe society meets the third Thursday of each month and welcomes new members. The society maintains the historic depot and is dedicated to ensuring its place in history and as well as a site for community events. Members would like to see the depot bustling with activity as it did in its heyday. Events are typically held on Saturdays. Check the events section to learn more.\nThe society invites community members to visit on these dates to help identify individuals and locations in the hundreds of photos in society’s archives.\nThe society is also working to capture the remembrances of Dunnellon’s citizens in an oral history project. If you are interested in sharing your memories, call\n(352) 465-5005\nand leave your contact information or use our contact form. A member of the Greater Dunnellon Historical Society will contact you to discuss the project.\nThe Greater Dunnellon Historical Society Inc. is a federal 501(c)3 charitable tax-free organization and all donations are tax deductible\n.\nJoin Us Today!\nFill out a membership application today.
