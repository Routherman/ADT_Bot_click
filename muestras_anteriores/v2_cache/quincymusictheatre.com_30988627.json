      "text": "Meet the Team\nOLGA\nOlga Connolly\nOutgoing Managing Director\nOlga moved to the beautiful woods of Gadsden County in 1994. A year later, she completed her Ph.D. in Commonwealth Literature at Florida State University, beginning a career in teaching, writing, and editing that spanned another two decades.\nHer love of theatre began during graduate school, when she picked up the theatre column for the Florida Flambeau. She likes to say that her first 30 dates with her husband were spent at the back of a theatre, writing copy by flashlight. But it was Quincy Music Theatre that really captured her imagination. For the last sixteen years, she has done props, costumes, lightboard and spot, crew, and a multitude of other tasks and builds at QMT. From 2018 – 2019, she also served as President of the QMT Board\n.\nCRAIG\nCraig Grafmiller\nScenic Carpenter\nCraig has been building and creating for as long as he can remember. Growing up on a dairy farm, he learned early on how to solve problems with his hands and make things work. That foundation has served him well through a 37-year career as a Mechanical Design Engineer, where he’s become expert at reading blueprints, using CAD software and bringing designs to life. His engineering background gives him a unique perspective on set construction, combining technical precision with practical craftsmanship. When he’s not at his day job, you’ll find Craig working on home renovation projects or volunteering with First Presbyterian Church of Quincy, where he has built access ramps and stairs for people with disabilities through Florida Cares.\nCraig started as a volunteer builder at QMT and quickly became an invaluable part of the team. His exceptional craftsmanship and dedication led to his transition into the role of part-time Scenic Carpenter. He’s excited to bring his skills to each new production and tackle whatever creative challenges come his way at QMT.\nCOLLINS\nCollins Cudjoe\nIntern\nCollins Cudjoe is a student at Florida State University with a passion for theatre management and a goal of one day leading a regional theatre. As an intern at Quincy Music Theatre, Collins is gaining hands-on experience across all areas of production and operations, supporting both front-of-house and behind-the-scenes efforts.\nWith a strong appreciation for community-driven storytelling and the role of the arts in creating connection, Collins brings energy, insight and a collaborative spirit to the QMT team. His time at QMT is part of his journey toward becoming a thoughtful and dynamic leader in the world of theatre.\nALUMNI SECTION\nIntern Alumni\nWILL TAYLOR\nSet Design Intern\n2023–2024\nDIANA BAXTER\nProduction Intern\n2024\nJOSHUA SIMON\nProduction Intern\n2023\n.entry-content\n#post-##\nMeet the Team\nOLGA\nOlga Connolly\nOutgoing Managing Director\nOlga moved to the beautiful woods of Gadsden County in 1994.
