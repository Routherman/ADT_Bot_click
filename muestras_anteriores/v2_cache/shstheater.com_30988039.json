Thank you to the stagecraft class and others who helped with the set, and Mr. Kolowith, Mr. Ashby and Mr. Boyle for building it. We are especially grateful for the artistry and excellence that the stagecraft class brought to the design and construction of all of the custom props in the show (there are so many!) Thank you Mr. Serres for helping us bring our lighting designs to life and for teaching a whole new tech team how to do lights and sound. Thank you to the boosters for all of the support. We would never be able to do this without Mrs. Graham and her never ending devotion to this program- thank you for everything! Finally, thank you to our administration team for allowing us to practice and perform safe theatre this year. We are so thankful for these experiences we've been able to share even in these strange Covid times.\n\"The Last Broadcast\" will be recorded for archival purposes on Wednesday, March 10, thanks to Melissa Dweck and Brad Scully, and the talented TV production students. Please check out Knack for That Productions on YouTube and at http://knackforthatproductions.com/.\nA Note From the Director:\nDirectors notes are always so difficult for me to write, and this year is no different. This week marks one year since we all went on spring break, not knowing we wouldn't be back until September. Producing Mamma Mia was always a dream of our program, and it was a heartbreaking loss felt by so many students, families, and staff when we didn't get to bring the project to its' completion.\nOf course we had no idea that there would be other kinds of unimaginable losses to follow. In the grand scheme of things, losing a show might not be as bad as it felt. But this year, the importance of theatre and art in education has only been magnified, and it is so apparent that theatre makes the world a brighter place, an easier place for many of us to exist in, and it keeps so many of us healthy, happy, and alive.\nThe first thing I'd like to acknowledge in this note is just how blessed I feel to have been allowed to produce theatre this year, and how honored I am to be able to direct and teach these young artists. Thank you to our administration for supporting and trusting us to provide safe and meaningful experiences for our kids. This play has been on my wish list for a long time and directing it has been a dream, and more. I have never laughed so much at rehearsal before, and I feel so lucky because I get to do it every day. Not only that, but through the silliness and \"schtick\" there are some truly tender lessons to be learned throughout the story of our loveable yet underappreciated Puffs.\nAt the surface, the Puffs can seem like zany personalities, even caricatures, but deep down, these characters are real people that a lot of us can identify with. One of the lessons I hope to pass on to our student actors is that we are stewards of every character we play, and they deserve to be honored and played honestly. I hope you can find a little bit of yourselves in these characters too.\nSpeaking of zany characters, did you know some of our actors are playing up to TWELVE different characters tonight? You'll notice \"costume changes\" that may just be a set of glasses here, or a hat there, an accent change, or a cape swished to the back. We hope you can allow yourself to suspend your disbelief tonight and let yourself get swept up in our fast paced adventure!\nI'd like to leave you with a quote from the Headmaster that I feel really sums up the heart of \"Puffs\":\n\"It is very easy to feel like you're only a secondary character in someone else's grand story. That does not mean, however, there isn't another story out there that's all about you. The one where you're the most important person in the world. The hero. We're all important, Wayne. And we're all unimportant. We're all heroes in some way. To someone.\"\nThank you for being here and supporting our student theatre artists.
