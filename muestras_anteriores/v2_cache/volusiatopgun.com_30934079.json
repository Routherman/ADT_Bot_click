If you would like to utilize your personal firearm, please ensure your firearm is unloaded prior to the lesson and that your ammunition is the correct type to use (please see\nRange Rules and Regulations\n).\nTargets and eye/ear protection are provided with the lesson if you do not have your own. Firearm rentals and ammunition are available but are not included in the price and will be an additional fee. Lessons are offered seven days a week (unless there is an event taking place). Lessons need to be booked in advance and require a $25 deposit (non-refundable) to secure your slot. The deposit is included with the price of the lesson and the remaining balance is paid at the time of your lesson. To reserve a time, please contact an associate at the range counter and we will be happy to make the appointment for you.\n**Please note that if you are 15 minutes late, your lesson will be canceled.**\nFirearm Safety Rules:\nTreat every firearm as if it were loaded\nKeep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire.\nBe sure of your target and what is next to and beyond it.\nNever point a firearm at anything you are not willing to injure, damage and/or destroy.\nLessons include:\nUnderstanding the basic firearms safety rules\nEye dominance\nNomenclature/parts\nStrong hand/weak hand\nStance\nGrip\nSight alignment/sight picture\nLoading/unloading\nTrigger control\nPrivate lessons will begin in a classroom setting that does not include live fire on the shooting range.
