By doing so, all the characteristics of each watershed can be evaluated to reflect the real, interconnected nature of Florida’s water resources. This increases the District’s ability to clearly identify, prioritize and address issues related to the area’s water resources. The Watershed Management Program provides a method to evaluate the capacity of a watershed to protect, enhance and restore water quality and natural systems while achieving flood protection.\nThis program provides five major elements:\nTopographic information\nWatershed evaluation\nA watershed management plan\nImplementation of best management practices\nMaintenance of watershed parameters and models\nFor additional information about the District’s comprehensive approach to watershed management, view or download our Watershed Management brochure.\nWatershed Management\nFloodplain Map Viewer\nThe Southwest Florida Water Management District, in cooperation with local governments, is developing flood risk information for watersheds throughout west-central Florida.\nThe floodplain map viewer is an interactive tool that allows you to view flood risk information\nthat has been developed to date as part of the District’s Watershed Management Program. The information is provided as an advisory tool for flood hazard awareness and to present preliminary floodplain results for public review and comment. Once finalized, the flood hazard information will be used by the District as the most appropriate information for\nenvironmental resource permitting\nand will, in the future, be used to revise the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs).\nIf you do not know which watershed you live in, you may submit an address using the\nwatershed search tool\nto find out.\nTo access this useful tool, proceed to the\nFloodplain Map Viewer\nand find your county and watershed. First time using the map viewer? Check out the\nQuick User's Guide\n.\nWhat is a flood map?\nA flood map is a risk assessment tool used to help determine the different flooding risks in a community. The most current maps, called Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps, depict high-, medium- and low-risk zones (25-30 percent of all flood claims come from moderate- to low-risk flood areas).\nView Floodplain Map Viewer »\nPublic Meetings\nAs preliminary flood risk information is developed for a watershed, the District is conducting public meetings so that citizens can learn about the data and science used to determine the flood hazard areas, view the preliminary floodplain results and have an opportunity to ask questions and provide comments. Upcoming meetings will be posted here (by watershed) and in local newspapers.\nView public meetings calendar »\nWhat is a watershed?\nA watershed is an area of land that water flows across as it moves toward a common body of water, such as a stream, river, lake or coast.\nLearn about our Watershed Management Program\nWhat is a floodplain?\nPart of every watershed, a floodplain is a dry or semi-dry land area where water collects when it rains.\nTypically found near rivers, lakes, coasts and depressions\nProvides temporary natural storage for runoff\nServes as recharge areas for the aquifer\nProvides important natural habitats for animals and plants\nVertical Datum Upgrade »\nLearn why the District is currently upgrading the datum used to record water level elevations\nWatershed Management\nComments or Questions\nIf you have a comment or question, contact\nthe WMP Info Line at (352) 415-0974\n, or email us at\nWMP@WaterMatters.org\n.\nFEMA Online Resources\nTo view FEMA’s existing Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), visit the\nFEMA Map Service Center\nand search by street address; or, you can view flood risk information using\nFEMA’s map viewer\n.\nRelated Videos\nSearch\nFacebook\nYouTube\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nX\nNextdoor\n2379 Broad Street,\nBrooksville, FL 34604\nTelephone: (352) 796-7211\nor 1-800-423-1476 (FL only)\nCopyright © Southwest Florida Water Management District 2018",
