We offer affordable drinks in a relaxed, easy going atmosphere where the regulars and staff will soon know your name. We can't wait to meet you!\nRenovated\nIn December of 2018, Turn 3 Sports Bar took a different turn. With new ownership, the entire place has changed for the better. The inside has been completely renovated. It is no longer a smoking venue. We now have a kitchen and serve food til 4:30am! The environment is very refreshing. We pride ourselves in being the cleanest sports bar in Boca Raton - hands down.\nEvents\nWe have several daily events. You can look forward to our free pool day on Mondays. We host a tournament at 8pm. It's non-apa. Anyone can join and there's a pool of money split between winners. Tuesdays we host poker tournaments and have our dart league team defending our home at night. Thursdays we have poker again with a dart tournament that follows. This tournament is open to anyone and is not league affiliated. Friday and Saturday we have live bands that rock the stage from 9:30pm-1:30am. Perfect for a group or birthday party. It's free to enter. Come listen to your favorite songs being played live. Sunday night we have karaoke. Whether you're a shooter, a thrower, a dancer, or singer - we look forward to seeing you! We have tons of fun activities waiting for you. So make that turn, to Turn 3.\nFood\nTurn 3 has food now! We have a menu full of great tasting appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, wings, salads, desserts, etc... Our kitchen stays open til last call - 4:30am.
