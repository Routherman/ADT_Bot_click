This landmark destination offers a rich history and longstanding reputation for integrity, exceptional service and compassion.\nOne of the largest country clubs in Naples, Vineyards has earned numerous awards and accolades for its dedication to delivering an unmatched, timeless experience for golf, wellness, fine dining, social events and more. Both residents and non-residents are welcome to enjoy the club’s resort-style amenities. This includes two award-winning, 18-hole\nchampionship golf courses\nset against 300-acres of verdant greens.\nLaying the Foundation\nfor a True Legacy\nVineyards Country Club began as the dream of two brothers and successful businessmen, Joseph and Michael Procacci. After growing their family’s tomato business into one of the largest wholesale produce distributors in the world, the Procacci brothers founded the Vineyards Development Corporation with the vision of creating a community of lasting integrity in North Naples. As a result, the country club provided buyers with greater value from the start. More than three decades later, Vineyards Country Club remains debt-free, competitive and stable, offering a sustainable legacy that many local clubs simply cannot match.\nBECOME A MEMBER\nAT VINEYARDS COUNTRY CLUB!\nEXPLORE MEMBERSHIP\nVineyards Country Club Awards & Accolades\nAs a debt-free club,\nmembers\ndo not pay assessments. The strong ownership of the Procacci family has ensured that Vineyards Country Club will maintain its legacy of stability and luxury for generations to come.\nCreating a community of lasting integrity inspired Vineyard’s creators to invest heavily in the community’s central feature, its award-winning country club. Vineyards Development Corp. broke ground on the country club in October 1986, with its completion in January 1988. One of the largest country clubs in Naples, more than 300 acres were dedicated to the club’s grounds and its clubhouse is a spacious 70,000 square feet.\nTo keep the club fresh and competitive at the highest level, Vineyards Country Club has continued to expand and enhance its facilities over the years. Since its original construction, the club has completed three renovations. During its 30th year, the clubhouse received a total renovation and brand-new 15,000 square-foot state-of-the-art Wellness Center & Spa, delivering exceptional amenities and service to Vineyards members and their guests.\n5X CONSECUTIVE\nWINNER\nPEOPLE’S CHOICE\nAWARD FOR BEST\nCOUNTRY CLUB\nNaples Daily News\nWINNER\nSAND DOLLAR AWARD\nFOR THE WELLNESS CENTER & SPA\nCollier Building\nIndustry Association\nWINNER\nFINALIST FOR BEST GOLF COURSE AND PICKLEBALL FACILITY\nGulfshore Life\nBest of the Gulfshore\nWINNER\nGOLDEN PALM AWARD\nFOR EXCELLENCE\nSouth Florida Hospitality\nIndustry Network\nHONOREE\nAND MEMBER\nAMERICA’ S\nHEALTHIEST CLUBS\nPrevo Health Solutions\nIndustry Association\nPROJECT\nPARTNER\nBLUE ZONES\nPROJECT COMMUNITY\nBlue Zones Project®\nSILVER ADDY\nWINNER\nCONSUMER WEBSITE\nAmerican Advertising Awards\n5X CONSECUTIVE\nWINNER\nPEOPLE’S CHOICE\nAWARD FOR BEST\nCOUNTRY CLUB\nNaples Daily News\nWINNER\nSAND DOLLAR AWARD\nFOR THE WELLNESS CENTER & SPA\nCollier Building\nIndustry Association\nWINNER\nFINALIST FOR BEST GOLF COURSE AND PICKLEBALL FACILITY\nGulfshore Life\nBest of the Gulfshore\nWINNER\nGOLDEN PALM AWARD\nFOR EXCELLENCE\nSouth Florida Hospitality\nIndustry Network\nHONOREE\nAND MEMBER\nAMERICA’ S\nHEALTHIEST CLUBS\nPrevo Health Solutions\nIndustry Association\nPROJECT\nPARTNER\nBLUE ZONES\nPROJECT COMMUNITY\nBlue Zones Project®\nSILVER ADDY\nWINNER\nCONSUMER WEBSITE\nAmerican Advertising Awards\nWhat People Say About Vineyards Country Club\nThis place is gorgeous!

The food was out of this world, not only delicious, but plated so beautifully you could honestly eat it with your eyes. The service was fantastic, and everything went so smoothly. A big shoutout to Demi Munar and her team! Demi was there the entire time, super responsive, and made sure every detail was perfect. She made the whole process stress-free and the night truly unforgettable. If you’re planning an event, I can’t recommend The Vineyards Country Club (and especially Demi and her team) enough!\nGina Supp\nin the last week\nMy husband and I got married here, and the second I went to the venue I knew this was where we were going to get married.
