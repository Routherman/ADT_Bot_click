I am currently giving lessons at my home located at 623 State Road 26, Melrose, Fl 32666\nMy philosophy is to teach students the way I would have liked to have been taught when I was young. One of my methods is to provide simplified versions of popular songs to inspire students to practice along with the basics of note reading and music theory. My focus with adult students is to encourage them to express their goal in taking music lessons. Together, we then develop a plan to  reach that goal. I often ask students to bring in recordings of their favorite songs that they would like to learn to play. Learning to play your favorite song always makes it more personal and fun!\nFooter\nfacebook like and share js",

We play often in the Gainesville-North Florida area and are available for parties, weddings and special events.\nMoondog was formed in 2004 originally as a trio then expanded to a four piece band. Moondog band members are John Stephens on guitar, Ed Coogan on harmonica and keyboard, Jon Rhoads on bass and Mark McMillan on drums.  The band offers a versatile range of sounds to fit any occasion, from rock ‘n roll dance music to soft background music.\nFor booking info or just to get in touch email:\nmoondog5200@gmail.com\nFooter\nfacebook like and share js",

I would like to take the time to meet with you and together plan the sequence of musical events for your wedding or special event. I can provide music for either a traditional or non-traditional style wedding. I play instrumental piano and guitar music along with vocals when requested. If the event is held outdoors I can set up both piano and guitar as well as a PA system in remote locations when needed. Please visit Samples-Piano & Guitar for some examples.\nReceptions and Special Events\nAfter the wedding Moondog is the perfect band for your reception. We can provide several configurations, from the acoustic duo to a four piece which includes guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. We play everything from soft background music to dance music. Moondog is great for everything from small parties to large banquets and clubs.
