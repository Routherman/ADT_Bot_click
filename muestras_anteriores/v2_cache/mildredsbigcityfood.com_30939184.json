By day it is a casual bistro-style setting, in the evening Mildred’s offers some of the most sophisticated cuisines in the region with service to match. The menu changes nightly, with a meticulously crafted wine list and top shelf, craft spirits. When dining at the New Deal, you are welcome and encouraged to order from our Mildred’s menu.\nThe New Deal Café features local award-winning burgers and salads and we all know there’s nothing better than a well-paired burger and beer. We also have a great pizza oven so that we can offer delicious, crispy flatbreads in addition to our burgers. We offer happy hour daily from 4-7pm and our back dining room is available for private events such as business dinners, showers, and birthday parties.\nIn 2011, Blue Gill Quality Foods opened its doors inviting friends and family to enjoy contemporary meals inspired by southern cuisine. Blue Gill offers local, fresh ingredients in dishes created by a talented kitchen staff. For private events, Blue Gill also provides a venue known as “the barn” adjoined to the main dining room.\nFrom day one, the Gills and their staff have ensured that their restaurants not only offer delicious cuisine but also maintain a community first orientation. While they purchase products from local farmers and artisans they also contribute to Gainesville in a more subtle manner. In 2008, Bert won the Florida Volunteer Restaurateur Award for his work as a mentor with the Eastside High School Culinary Team. Additionally, under Tara & Bert’s careful guidance numerous Gainesville residents have had the opportunity to learn skills of the trade, which has allowed them to seek hospitality careers in competitive environments such as New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta.\nSubscriptions\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nFill out this form to get all of our latest news and updates.\nName\n*\nFirst\nLast\nEmail\n*\nΔ\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\nOverlay Wrapper\nOverlay Wrapper Closed\nOverlay Wrapper\nOverlay Wrapper Closed\nOverlay Wrapper\nOverlay Wrapper Closed\nFind Us\nMildred's Big City Food is located at 3445 West University Ave. in the Westgate Regency Shopping Center.
