      "text": "About US\nTwo airline pilots that have a passion for the “Golden Era” of Flying Boats along with the love of craft beer.  Combine that with a young, talented chef with a passion for creating the best homemade wood fired pizza accompanied with unique dishes and a drive for providing the best service possible.  What could possibly go wrong?\nThe Founders\nBill Bow\nBill was raised in Homestead, Florida during the late 50’s, early 60’s.  His Uncle Dick was actually a Flying Boat mechanic at the Dinner Key Marine Terminal in Miami.  Bill’s big career break came when his cousin, Dick (Uncle Dick’s son) secured him an interview with an airline he was working for.  Once Bill got one of his appendages in the door, there was no stopping him. After making a number of seemingly ridiculous moves to smaller and smaller airlines and larger and larger pay cuts he found himself in the top 24 pilots at the UPS Airline in 1988.  He retired in 2017 as number 4 on the seniority list with 30 years of service. Bill’s passion for aviation did not end with his retirement. Bill lives in a Fly-In community, where he routinely flies his fully Pimped Out, Cessna 172, affectionately known as “Betty.” Bill has traveled the world with UPS and has been able to sample some of the finest and worst beers in the world while on layovers. The opportunity to combine a love for the Flying boats, craft beer and fantastic food was a no brainer.  Come visit Bill, sometimes known as “Cabana Boy” and share some lies over a cold craft beer.\nTim Kirby\nTim was born in Miami and his father would retire in 1986 from Pan American World Airlines as a Professional Flight Engineer.  In Tim’s youth his father would routinely take him out to Watson Island to watch the Chalk’s Seaplanes arrive and depart. Another past time was watching the Coast Guard’s Albatrosses doing touch and goes in Biscayne Bay.   This planted the seed for the seaplanes. Trips to “Corrosion Corner” with his father would capture the romance of the round motored airliners such as the DC-6/7 and Super Connie’s. Tim would pursue his father’s footsteps and become an airline pilot also.  Luckily Tim was able to sample a wee bit of nostalgia, initially flying the Convair 440’s and DC-3’s en route to eventually landing his dream job with Piedmont Airlines in 1985. Tim also has taken his aviation passion to his home life where he lives in the same Fly-In community as Bill.  Tim holds a mechanics license and restores Stearman bi-planes for a sideline hobby/job. Tim’s passion for craft beer began some time ago and continues to this day. Especially being able to promote Florida Craft Beers. The opportunity to share his passions with others inspired the idea of an aviation themed taproom.  Wrap that up with keeping the history alive of the flying boats is also a wonderful opportunity to share as well. Stop in and find out more about both the Flying Boats and Florida Craft Beer.\nManaging Partner\nTucker  Bengoa\nTucker was born in Bilbao Spain and soon after relocated to Ocala, Florida with his parents. Around the age of 11 Tuckers first contact with cooking occurred. This relationship with cooking developed in Tucker’s home kitchen where he watched and assisted his mother’s cooking. Tucker’s mother, Teresa, a woman born in Portugal cooked often, having learned her cooking skills from her native home as well as getting experience in France. Throughout Tucker’s youth he kept cooking as a home activity while he pursued other hobbies such as drag racing, go-kart racing, and soccer. Tucker’s experience with cooking continued again in 2010 when he started to work as a cook at a craft beer and tapas restaurant. Over the years his passion would grow and he began to experiment with at home cooking projects. Such endeavors included making scratch bacon and jalapeno jams and pickles. Tucker draws inspiration for his cooking creations from tapas style plates, creating something new, and using fresh ingredients. It has been a goal and a dream for Tucker to be a part of a venture that highlights a creative menu, a Florida influenced craft beer selection, and atmosphere with history.\n#content\n#primary\n#content-wrap\nAbout US\nTwo airline pilots that have a passion for the “Golden Era” of Flying Boats along with the love of craft beer.  Combine that with a young, talented chef with a passion for creating the best homemade wood fired pizza accompanied with unique dishes and a drive for providing the best service possible.  What could possibly go wrong?\nThe Founders\nBill Bow\nBill was raised in Homestead, Florida during the late 50’s, early 60’s.  His Uncle Dick was actually a Flying Boat mechanic at the Dinner Key Marine Terminal in Miami.  Bill’s big career break came when his cousin, Dick (Uncle Dick’s son) secured him an interview with an airline he was working for.  Once Bill got one of his appendages in the door, there was no stopping him.
