At the time of the American Revolution, the Commonwealth of Virginia confiscated the property from owner Francis Jerdone, who was a Tory, because of his political principles. Mr. Jerdone was able to regain the estate and then sold it to George Divers in 1785. Legend has it that Mr. Divers, who was in Philadelphia at the time of the sale, rode two horses to death in his dash south to claim the estate.<br><br>\n\t\tIt was under Mr. Diver's ownership that in 1802, Thomas Jefferson drew plans for an addition to the house, an octagonal addition with two rooms. A subsequent owner, General Bernard Peyton, divided the Jefferson Room into two stories and four rooms.<br><br>\n\t\tIn the spring of 1927, an idea was conceived by local businessmen to develop a country club and residential community of a quality that would do justice to the historic atmosphere of Albemarle County.\"\n\t</p>\nCoral Ridge Yacht Club History\n1947\n1947\nThe location and vision for the Coral Ridge Yacht Club was first discussed by Hal E. Wolfe and the owners of Coral Ridge Properties, James S. Hunt and Stephen Calder.\n1951\n1951\nHal E. Wolfe completed the roster of 450 members and the membership was closed.\n1959\n1959\nDemolition of the old Clubhouse started.\n1968\n1968\nThe CRYC gained the distinction of being the first east coast yacht club to be admitted to the Florida Council of Yacht Clubs.\n1972\n1972\nThe Club celebrated its 25th anniversary with a gala year of special events.\n2019\n2019\nCarolyn S. Greenlaw made history by being appointed as the Club’s first female Commodore, one of the few female Commodores in the nation at the time.\n2020\n2020\nThe Club underwent a $4 million dollar renovation of the original Clubhouse, retaining the old-world charm while upgrading all of the interior spaces and adjacent patios with modern amenities and design.\n2023\n2023\nConstruction commences on the highly anticipated outdoor entertainment area and dining space, “The Pointe.”\n2024\n2024\nThe Pointe, a stunning waterfront restaurant, opened on December 8th, 2024. Featuring a full-service bar seating 26, as well as elegantly arranged tables seating over 150 members, it offers a seamless indoor-outdoor dining experience. With a retractable patio roof and wind screens, guests can enjoy breathtaking views in comfort year-round.\nWeather\n81\n°F\nscattered clouds",
