Leave your flip-flops behind and soak in the fun, food, and fruity drinks at Longboards Tiki Beach Grille, where the triumphant spirit of surf meets the calm rhythm of the shoreline.\nLet's Hang Out\nFood:\nOpen Every Day | 11:00am – 10:00pm\nDrinks:\nSunday to Thursday | 11:00am – 10:00pm\nFriday to Saturday | 11am – 12am\nLive Entertainment:\nFridays  | 6:00 - 9:00 pm\nSaturdays  |  6:00 - 9:00 pm\nSundays  |  Noon - 4:00 pm\nBites & Bevs\nSEE MENU\nTake in the Perfect View\nWe’re so close to the ocean, you could probably go for a swim while you wait for your food. Or, you could just feast your eyes on the kaleidoscope of blues and greens on one of the world’s most beautiful beaches.\nLive Entertainment\nGroovin’ to live music is good for the soul — just take a look around during any of our weekend jam sessions, hosted by local musicians on Friday and Saturday evenings as well as Sunday afternoons. Smiling faces and lovely people galore.\nLearn More\n(Be Happy) Hour\nTime flies when you’re having rum, tequila, and something with body or bubbles.\nEnjoy food and drink specials from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm every afternoon from Sunday to Thursday.\nLearn More\nGet on Board\n“Great place for afternoon drinks to escape a scorching sun or summer downpour! Walk up the boards to the oceanside bar which has benches with umbrellas and barstools looking over the water. Good place to catch a launch or watch the surf!”\n- Michele Byrne, Google Reviews\n“Great place! If you want a tiki bar atmosphere then look no further than Longboards. Great drinks and great food! I had loaded nachos with BBQ and it was delicious. Bartender was so friendly and checked on me multiple times. There is a deck and bar with drinks close to the beach. Felt like I was in Hawaii! 5 stars, check this place out!\n”\n-Robert, Google Reviews\n“Awesome tiki bar right on the water in Cocoa Beach! Love this hotel and this bar! The bartenders are always super friendly as well.\n”\n-Jack Davis, Google Reviews\nFloat on By\nWhen you’re as close to the crystal-clear waters of Cocoa Beach as we are, life's as easy as it is breezy. Our oceanfront location makes it easy to drift in for a post-surf sesh lunch or a lively night of delicious drinks and live music.\nChillin’\nSee FULL GALLERY\nWave Hello\nto Cocoa Beach\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\nBites & Bevs\nSEE MENU\nTake in the Perfect View\nWe’re so close to the ocean, you could probably go for a swim while you wait for your food.
