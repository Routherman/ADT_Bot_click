Dreyfoos Concert Hall\nWith a depth and imaginatory infinity that is beyond question, musical multi-hyphenate Jacob Collier has taken the world by storm. Described as “the colourful Mozart of Gen Z” by\nthe New York Times\n, his genre-bridging discography has led to 7 GRAMMY® wins and 15 GRAMMY® nominations, making him the first British artist in history to win GRAMMYs for each of his first 5 studio albums. His fearless approach to music has attracted 100+ collaborators, including Coldplay, SZA, Stormzy, Anoushka Shankar, Shawn Mendes, Hans Zimmer, Joni Mitchell and more. Whether it’s writing songs in keys that don’t exist, or bringing 100,000 people together in improvised song – Jacob continues to push the boundaries of what’s creatively possible in a language beyond words.\nPlease note:\nThere is a four ticket limit for this event per guest.

Dreyfoos Concert Hall\nWith a depth and imaginatory infinity that is beyond question, musical multi-hyphenate Jacob Collier has taken the world by storm. Described as “the colourful Mozart of Gen Z” by\nthe New York Times\n, his genre-bridging discography has led to 7 GRAMMY® wins and 15 GRAMMY® nominations, making him the first British artist in history to win GRAMMYs for each of his first 5 studio albums. His fearless approach to music has attracted 100+ collaborators, including Coldplay, SZA, Stormzy, Anoushka Shankar, Shawn Mendes, Hans Zimmer, Joni Mitchell and more. Whether it’s writing songs in keys that don’t exist, or bringing 100,000 people together in improvised song – Jacob continues to push the boundaries of what’s creatively possible in a language beyond words.\nPlease note:\nThere is a four ticket limit for this event per guest.
