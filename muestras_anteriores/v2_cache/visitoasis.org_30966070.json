These three are co-equal and are one God.\nGenesis 1:1, 26,27; Genesis 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19;1 Peter 1:2; 2 Corinthians 13:14\nman\nMan is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. He is the supreme object of God’s creation. Although man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called “sin.” This attitude separates man from God.\nGenesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a; Romans 3:23; Isaiah 59:1, 2\neternity\nMan was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.\nJohn 3:16; John 2:25; John 5:11-13; Romans 6:23; Revelation 20:15; Matthew 18:8; Matthew 25:44,46\njesus christ\nJesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven’s glory and will return again to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\nMatthew 1:22,23; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-5; John 14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14,15; 1 Corinthians 15:3,4; Romans 1:3,4; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Timothy 6:14,15; Titus 2:13\nsalvation\nSalvation is a gift from God to man. Man can never make up for his sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can man be saved from sin's penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.\nRomans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:6; John 1:12; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:1\neternal security\nBecause God gives man eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self effort of the Christian. It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives this security.\nJohn 10:28-29; Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 10:10, 14; 1 Peter 1:3-5\nholy spirit\nThe Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth and guidance for doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live under His control daily.\n2 Corinthians 3:17; John 16:7-13; John 14:16-17; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 1:13; Galatians 5:25; Ephesians 5:18\nthe bible\nThe Bible is God's Word to all men. It is written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of error.\n2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21; 2 Timothy 1:13; Psalm 119:10, 160; Psalm 12:6; Proverbs 30:5\nour beliefs\ngod\nGod is the Creator and Ruler of the universe.
