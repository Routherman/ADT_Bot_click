Because of the way Julie handled our experience, my exec would like to do two trips a year going forward to your hotel.\nI’m sure you are aware of her above and beyond approach to her role, but I wanted to make sure you know that everyone walked away from the trip saying that La Playa was simply magical, and Julie made it happen!\nWarmest Regards,\nMaggie Beyer\nNorthwestern Mutual\nEveryone is raving about the service, food and staff!
