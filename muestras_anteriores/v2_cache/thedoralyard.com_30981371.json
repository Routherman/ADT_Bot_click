Danny joined The Doral Yard in May 2022, when he fell in love with the concept and its exciting potential. Danny leads the day-to-day operation, directs our talented leaders, collaborates with our resident vendors, and continuously crafts and executes The Yard’s strategic vision.\n+\nDanny previously served as Director of Operations of B Bistro + Bakery, where he led the company to national media recognition and the highest level of reputational and operational excellence. Other professional highlights include his tenure as an Operations Manager at Dunkin’ Donuts and National Managing Partner at Granier Bakeries. At Dunkin’, Danny managed the turnaround of the brand’s worst performing restaurants in America into highly successful operations. At Granier Bakeries, he spearheaded the expansion of Spain’s premier bakery chain into the United States at age 25.\nDanny’s favorite aspect of his job is undoubtedly the opportunity to create more and better jobs that are respectable and dignifying for members of our community. For Danny, creating this impact alongside the powerful, local, family-owned brands that operate at The Yard is an unbeatable feeling.\nWhen he’s not leading the team at The Doral Yard, Danny can be found absorbed in a book or working out at his boxing gym. On Sundays, you can catch him at Church and watching Formula 1 or a great soccer match.\nFavorite Meal at The Yard:\nThe Korean Salmon at Barbakoa by Finka\n–\nGUSTAVO CARMONA\nGeneral Manager\nMeet Gustavo Carmona, who hails from Venezuela and joined The Yard in early 2023.\nGustavo fell in love with The Doral Yard’s mission and culture, and felt that taking on this role would be an exciting new professional challenge. In his day-to-day role, he expertly guides the team on the floor and behind the bar while they provide hospitality to our guests, vendors, and talent.\n+\nGustavo has been working in the hospitality industry for over eight years in different positions. In his more recent role, he assisted in opening a new restaurant, hand in hand with an amazing group of people. As General Manager of B Bistro + Bakery at The Grove, he excelled at creating a motivating and healthy environment for his team.\nGustavo has brought this passion and skillset to The Doral Yard, where he feels proud to support each team member’s learning and growth throughout this daily adventure.\nIn his free time, he enjoys going to the movies and spending time with Marlon, his four-legged son. He’s always open to exploring new sports and trendy outside activities.\nFavorite Meal at The Yard\n:\nHouse Salad at Un Pollo and any flavor of margarita made by our team!\n–\nGUSTAVO LAPI\nFloor Manager\nGustavo Lapi has been bringing his contagious passion and enthusiasm to The Doral Yard since early 2023. With a focus on Front-of-House and Floor management, he serves as on-the-ground support for any and all service-related issues.\n+\nGustavo previously worked at Brickell’s Fourteen Eatery, where he began in the kitchen and was promoted into management. He subsequently worked his way up the ranks at B Bistro + Bakery from host to server to Assistant Manager.  He ultimately was promoted to General Manager of B Bistro + Bakery Brickell, and credits this experience as one that allowed him to discover his love and passion for the hospitality industry.\nGustavo enjoys working hand to hand with the team, guiding them to improve every day, and inspiring them to offer the best service possible. In earlier years, he studied psychology at Yacambú University, and his interest in this field continuously helps him understand and manage his team.\nWhen he’s not at work, Gustavo enjoys exploring Miami’s culinary scene with friends and learning about Interior Design, his second passion.\nFavorite Meal at The Yard:\nPokekai’s\nPoke Burger paired with an Eternal Spring from The Bar at The Yard\n–\nJASON GARZIA\nManager\nJason hails from Hialeah, Miami, and has been part of The Yard team since early 2022.\nA jack-of-all-trades, Jason’s leadership role includes day-to-day management of all front-of-house activities, as well as working closely with our accoun\nting team on accounts payable matters.\n+\nPrior to his role at The Yard, Jason worked in Sales at Carnival Cruise Lines for 7 years. In his earlier years, he pursued pharmaceutical studies and worked at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician.\nKnown for being a devoted team player, Jason’s favorite aspect of his job is working side-by-side with his colleagues, and instilling every team member and vendor with a sense of their importance and significance as part of The Doral Yard.\nHe enjoys playing sports, including flag football, basketball, and golf, and is a CrossFit enthusiast.  Most of all, Jason loves spending time with my family, especially his wife and adorable newborn son.\nFavorite Meal at The Yard:\nPokekai’s Wontons\n–\nCICI CABALLERO\nBar Manager\nCici Caballero became part of The Doral Yard family in October 2024, bringing her passion for mixology and hospitality from Barbakoa by Finka, where she worked her way up from bartender to Bar Lead and eventually Bar Manager.
