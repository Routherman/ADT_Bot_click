      "text": "About Us\nOur Story\nSince the day we were inspired to open our doors, our family has held true to our vision of creating an extraordinary dining experience. After traveling the world together, we decided to establish a culinary experience right here in Port Saint Joe, the place we call home. Originally, The White Marlin was the inspiration of Mark Haddock and is now locally owned and operated by the Haddock Family. The impeccable attention to detail that Mark envisioned, along with the rest of the Haddock family, has already earned The White Marlin a reputation as one of the most highly rated destination restaurants in the Panhandle of Florida. Our chefs select only the most pristine fish, beef, and oysters and have been recognized for their discerning – and delicious – standards, not\nto mention that the location has been known for its sunsets for more than two decades. Situated overlooking the beautiful St. Joseph’s Bay, The White Marlin has extensive outdoor deck seating and frequent local live music, and thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the water from inside, the best seat in the house is any seat. Whether you come for our views or for our food, we guarantee you’ll leave with your next reservation in mind!\nThe Haddock Family would like to thank former owners of Sunset Coastal Grill  for helping us make the White Marlin the best place to enjoy a gorgeous view and incredible cuisine.\nOur Story\nSince the day we were inspired to open our doors, our family has held true to our vision of creating an extraordinary dining experience.
