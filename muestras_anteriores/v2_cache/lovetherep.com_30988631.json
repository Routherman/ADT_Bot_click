Since then, The REP became just that and so much more—a vibrant cultural heart where locals and visitors from across the world could gather, connect, and experience the wonder of live performance.\nWe were more than a stage; we were a gathering place. Our purpose was to spark vital conversations, build community, and enrich lives through the unique power of performance. Our greatest pride comes from the memories we helped create—the children who saw their first play with us, the annual traditions for countless families, and the collective moments of shared wonder. Our stage hosted not only professional theatre but a vibrant mix of concerts, films, touring family shows, and educational outreach that created unforgettable shared experiences for audiences of all ages.\nThis 25-year journey was a shared production, and we are eternally grateful to everyone who played a part. Our deepest gratitude extends to our visionary founders, Craige Hoover and Jennifer Steele; to the artists and volunteers who poured their hearts into every show; and to the generous donors, sponsors, foundations, and Board members who sustained and guided our mission. To every audience and community member who believed in the power of theatre: you were the lifeblood of this organization. The REP’s story may be ending, but the community we built together will forever be our proudest production.\n/.sc_title\nOur Legacy\nArt, Education & Entertainment\nFor 25 years, The REP was driven by a mission to be more than a stage—we aimed to be a gathering place that enriched the 30A community through art, education, and entertainment.\nOur vision was to be a world-class regional theatre, a goal we pursued through unforgettable programming—from professional theatre that sparked vital conversations, to touring shows for the whole family, film screenings, concerts, and educational outreach that created collective moments of shared awe for audiences of all ages.\nWe are proud to have served as a premier professional theatre in Northwest Florida and a vibrant cultural heart for our community, making a lasting contribution to the quality of life for the locals and visitors who gathered with us.\n/.sc_title\n.entry-content\nMore than a stage\nThe 25-Year Story of The REP\nOur journey began 25 years ago with a single vision: to build a vibrant home for the arts in the heart of our beautiful 30A community.
