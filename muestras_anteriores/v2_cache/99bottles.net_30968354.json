From first pour until last call, we love to welcome you on your own experience of craft beer, boutique wines, and extraordinary liquids of the finest kind.\nWhat Makes 99 Bottles Different?\nFounded in April 2019, 99 Bottles is about the experience of extraordinary liquid. Built by a team of passionate hospitality professionals and an experience in this space where there is not a bad beer in the place. 99 Bottles is what happens when someone who loves great beer lets his imagination run wild. A beer bar where “what if we put this on draft?” becomes “why didn’t we think of that sooner?” The place where world-class pilsners share a tap list with Rosé All Day and hazy IPAs. A world where kombucha has a tap and so does prosecco – whatever your taste, this is where you find your new favorite. Like Willy Wonka’s factory meets an art gallery for beer lovers – and every exhibit is meant to be tasted!\nThe team at 99 Bottles has looked at (and likely tasted) every beer on the wall and approved it for your drinking pleasure. Every beer, like every musician in a symphony, has a place in the symphony. Whether a classic brown ale, an old school West Coast IPA, or a turbid tornado from New England, the name of the game is 99 Bottles – and they’re all meant to be taken down and passed around!\nJoin Us For\nBagel Brunch\nLearn More\nEvery Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
