Though it originated in Mexico, it is observed across various cultures, each with its unique customs and traditions. Visual artist\nNicario Jiménez\n;\nSamantha Navarro\n, member of Danza Azteca Guadalupana (Guadalupean Aztec Dance); and\nNely Rodríguez\n, Coalition of Immokalee Workers, will come together in a panel discussion to illuminate the profound significance and rich ancestral traditions behind the celebration of el Día de los Muertos. They honor this vibrant and spiritual event through their unique perspectives and cultural heritage.\nThis panel discussion is part of the\nDía de los Muertos Celebration\n.\nbaker museum lecture\nAll museum lectures and public programs of The Baker Museum include same-day admission to\nThe Baker Museum\n.\nNicario Jiménez\nNicario Jiménez\nNicario Jiménez\nNicario Jiménez was born in Ayacucho, Peru, a peasant community in the high Peruvian Andes. He is a master retablo artist known for creating intricate three-dimensional dioramas that blend traditional Andean art with contemporary social narratives, often incorporating themes such as Día de los Muertos. His work tells stories of cultural resilience, migration, and daily life in the Andes, bridging the gap between history and modernity.\nAs a child, Jiménez learned the art of crafting religious retablos, or altarpieces, under the guidance of his father, Florentino Jiménez. While working with his father, Jiménez learned techniques he continues to use for his mixed media sculptures — a mixture of boiled potatoes and gypsum for the figurines and wood for the boxes. Jiménez attended the Universidad Nacional de San Cristóbal de Huamanga in Ayacucho, Perú, and has taught and lectured at institutions including the University of Miami and American University. His retablos have been showcased at prestigious exhibitions across the United States, including the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum and the Museum of Man in San Diego. The Smithsonian Institution has even selected Nicario’s work for its\nSeeds of Change\nexhibition and is now part of their permanent collection.\nSamantha Navarro\nSamantha Navarro\nSamantha Navarro\nSamantha Navarro was born in Naples, Florida, to Mexican parents. Ceremonial dance has been a constant in her life. She has been dancing with Danza Azteca Guadalupana (Guadalupe Aztec Dancers) since she was 6 years old and currently serves as the group’s\nsahumadora\n— the person responsible for smudging and overseeing the sacred fire before the dance ceremony begins. Now that she has a family of her own, she has continued the tradition. Now, all of her family members participate in the Danza Azteca Guadalupana.\nNely Rodríguez\nNely Rodríguez\nNely Rodríguez\nNely Rodríguez was born in Tamaulipas, Mexico. She has been a community organizer and worker-leader of the Florida-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) since 2007. Rodríguez leads worker-to-worker educational meetings on farms across more than 25 states on farmworkers’ new rights under the Fair Food Code of Conduct. She heads the CIW’s Women’s Group gatherings, is a speaker at CIW events and meets with public officials and food industry leaders to press the case for Fair Food.\nIn 2013, Rodriguez was selected to be highlighted in WGCU Public Media’s “Makers: Women Who Make Southwest Florida” as one of several leaders recognized for their contributions to building a stronger and more just Southwest Florida.\nFor over 25 years, the CIW Women’s Group has upheld a cherished tradition by creating an annual ofrenda (altar) to honor and celebrate the lives of departed loved ones on the\nDía de los Muertos\n. Rooted in remembrance, this heartfelt practice has provided farmworkers — many of whom are far away from their families — with a meaningful sense of connection, belonging and community.\nDanza Azteca Guadalupana\nDanza Azteca Guadalupana\nDanza Azteca Guadalupana was officially founded in Naples, Florida, by Guadalupe Navarro, originally from Guanajuato, Mexico. After her passing, Celestina and Leobardo Navarro (Samantha’s parents) started leading the group. The family first began dancing in 2000 as part of a\nmanda\n—a promise to the Virgin of Guadalupe in gratitude for a family member’s health. Initially composed solely of family members, the group has since welcomed newcomers, creating a space for ceremony and a safe and supportive environment for youth.\nLast year, Danza Azteca Guadalupana was honored with an\nestandarte\n(banner), an achievement reserved for committed and long-standing ceremonial dance collectives. Generals or guides bestow this recognition upon the captains or leaders of a group, signifying their dedication to preserving tradition. Danza Azteca Guadalupana embodies commitment, pride, and reverence, upholding an ancestral ceremony that endured despite colonial disruptions. It is not entertainment or performance, but a living tradition.\nPlan Your Visit\nTicket Policy\nSafety & Security\nMuseum Admission\nMap—Directions\nFood—Beverage\nSeating Charts\nGroup Tickets\nAccessibility\nParking\nArrival\nFAQ\nLecture\nPanel Discussion\nDía de los Muertos\nNicario Jiménez\n,\nvisual artist\nSamantha Navarro\n,\nDanza Azteca Guadalupana\nNely Rodríguez\n,\nCoalition of Immokalee Workers\nDía de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a traditional Indigenous celebration that honors the lives of departed loved ones.

A pioneering figure in American music, Antes was not only the country’s first luthier but also one of its earliest chamber music composers. His writing — elegant, balanced and conversational — gives equal voice to each instrument. The program continues with J.F. Peter’s String Quintet No. 1 in D Major. A contemporary of Antes and prolific composer of sacred music, Peter’s chamber works are captivating and filled with expressive color and curiosity.\nThe afternoon concludes with Mendelssohn’s String Quartet No. 2 in A Minor. Widely regarded as his first fully mature quartet, it is a richly emotional work that channels the energy of new love and pays tribute to Beethoven, Mendelssohn’s greatest musical influence.\nThe Sypert Salon Series is generously sponsored by Drs.

Music is based on timing, and rhythms are essentially patterns of beats organized by time signatures. Musical notes correspond to specific sound frequencies while intervals between notes can be defined by simple ratios.  Both music and math also use patterns such as repetition, symmetry and variation. This concert will highlight these common traits between music and math and will display how composers use sequences and transformations that mirror mathematical operations. This engaging and entertaining classical music concert featuring the Naples Philharmonic will include works from composers such as Mozart, Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky!\nStudy Guide\nHomeschoolers and families are welcome at the 10am performance.

Rounding out the concert is Miguel del Águila’s Woodwind Quintet No. 2, a colorful and imaginative four-movement journey that travels through mystical landscapes and culminates in a whirlwind finale reminiscent of a bustling Middle Eastern market.\nThe Wang Chamber Music series is generously sponsored by David* and Cecile Wang.\n* deceased\nNaples Philharmonic\ntab bio NP\nNaples Philharmonic\nFounded in 1982, the Naples Philharmonic normally performs over 140 orchestral and chamber concerts, as well as opera and ballet, education, community and special event concerts from September through June each year.\nMeet the Musicians\nAlexander Shelley\nArtistic and Music Director\nMeet Alexander\nJack Everly\nPrincipal Pops Conductor\nMeet Jack\nJames Ehnes\nArtistic Partner\nMeet James\nManuel López-Gómez\nAssociate Conductor\nMeet Manuel\nProgram Book\nProgram Book\nView this month's program book to get general information about\nArtis—Naples\nand to read articles about this month’s activities.
