Take a seat at a booth or the bar, relax and catch a game.\nBecause of our location at a relatively high elevation on the island, Jack Flats stays open for as long as possible during hurricanes. Hurricanes are part of life in Key West, and we are proud to serve the community when life on the island gets a little messy, as it did during Hurricane Irma of 2017.
