Every day we wake up in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave. We owe this to our Military, Fire and Police past and present. Their needs are not always met and we want to be there for them. Our mission statement, I believe, says it all!\nOne team, their cause is our cause.\nWe are here to support those who have served and protected us. Our goal is to honor and support our Military,  Fire and Police, and EMT; physically, financial and spiritually. Many of us are civilians who have never served in any of these capacities and many of us have served in one or more of them. All of us have one common cause and that is to provide a network of support that is able to help these service members in any way we can. We are a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization and we are always accepting new members to join us in our mission.\nWe recently opened our social club, The Warehouse, to have a place to connect with each other and meet new members. The Warehouse is a spacious 3000 sq ft full liquor bar with a delicious food menu located in Leesburg, Florida. Our goal is to create a sustainable business that will generate a profit that we can give to the charities that we hold dear, our service members. The Warehouse has volunteering opportunities in various positions within our daily operations and special events, contact us for details.\nCheck out our Facebook!\nVisit our page\nand give us a LIKE if you want to stay updated!\n/.main\n/.row\n/.content\n/.wrap\n© 2025 MFPSA - Military, Fire, Police Support Association - WordPress Theme by\nKadence WP\nWrapper\nCustom Facebook Feed JS",
