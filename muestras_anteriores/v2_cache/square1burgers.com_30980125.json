So we’re returning burgers to their roots, back to Square 1. Simple is savory, and our recipes reflect that. Our ingredients are high quality and fresh. Our proteins come from the wide-open pastures of the west, and farms that raise livestock humanely—without hormones or antibiotics. We hand press every patty and grill each burger to order. Why? Because burgers deserve better. You and your family deserve better. Whether indulging in Angus, Kobe, Buffalo, Lamb, Portobello Mushroom or Vegan—on the bun or beyond—SQ1 serves affordable luxury you can devour. Visit us today and rediscover what burgers should be. There’s enough Awesome for everyone.\nThe burger is sacred and as All-American as football and fireworks. But somehow, burgers have turned fast, cheap and unhealthy.
