It is at the same time rewarding and maddening - and it is without a doubt the greatest game mankind has ever invented.”\nAn Arnold Palmer Signature Course\nThe championship golf course at Frenchman’s Reserve is without question the ultimate expression of the Arnold Palmer guarantee of uncompromising standards in golf course design. With large, subtle greens and fairways lined with tall Florida pines and colorful wildflowers, the course enhances the beauty of the lush South Florida landscape.\n18-hole, 6,735-yard, par-72 Arnold Palmer Signature Golf Course complete with two Paspalum grass driving range tees, two practice putting greens and an expansive three green short game practice area.\n#content",
