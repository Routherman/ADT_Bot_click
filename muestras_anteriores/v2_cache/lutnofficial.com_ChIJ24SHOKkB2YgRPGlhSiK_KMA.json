      "text": "Aug\n28\n2019\nUncategorized\nThe event production industry has been forever changed with the creation of 3D Projection Mapping. Modern technology now allows projection mapping to transform a plain surface from the side of a building, or inside of a convention center, into a wall of amazement.\nBut what is 3D Projection Mapping?\n3D Projection Mapping is the projection of 3D images and video onto nearly any surface. These images can be as complex as entire skyline or as simple as a logo. The use of this technology has changed the way event coordinators can change the ambiance of an event. 3D Projection Mapping is designed to wrap around specific physical features of the surface, turning the objects into interactive 3D displays.\nHow Does Projection Mapping Work?\nBy using a pre-production process during which images are fitted onto a 3D graphic rendering of the building, the same objects appear to wrap themselves around the physical features of any structure. They give the appearance of being painted on and part of the same structure. This can be done on a smaller scale to project 3D images on anything from a person in a window or a car changing their color, appearance and structure.\nThinking of launching a new product or hosting a party? Let our creative team come up with some renderings to project at your next event! 3D Projection Mapping is huge in advertising and promotions, because of its interactive nature. From dogs running on a wall, to dancing butterflies. Projection mapping is completely changing the way we view our surroundings. Projection Mapping has evolved since its debut nearly 20 years ago when it was used to project visuals and enhance live-music shows. It is now used by production companies, such as Light Up The Night to amplify our events, by using animated visuals and music to produce cinema style action and narratives. Projection mapping can turn buildings, walls, floors and even common objects into something truly magical.

      "text": "Aug\n15\n2019\nTypes of Lighting\nYou know that warm, fuzzy feeling while being captivated by the colors of a sunset, or those dull and depressing emotions while walking down the street during the darker seasons of the year? Well warm colors such as red, yellow and orange invoke excitement and attract your attention, whereas lack of colors can induce a sensation of depression and lethargy.\nLight Up The Night is often asked what color should be used for an event. While choice of color may be about personal preference or representation of a brand, we believe that there is more to it than just being pleasant to look at. We question and study the thinking behind color, the feelings invoked, and what colors help open and stimulate our senses. As an event production company, we understand the psychology of color. Usually, when hosting a private party, people will choose their favorite color or colors. But when it comes to planning a corporate event or a festival, event managers often do not have a specific theme… This is where Team Light Up The Night comes into play.\nThe psychology of color has been pondered since the days of Sir Isaac Newton and his discovery of light refraction. Through his discovery, the concept of complementary colors was formed. Complementary colors are pairings of colors which are diametrically opposite on the color wheel, these colors emphasize the qualities of each other with red complementing green, and blue with yellow. Our sensations are exemplified when these pairings appear together, for instance blue and yellow heighten each other as seen above in van Gogh’s painting\nCafe Terrace on the Place du Forum.\nThe Breakdown of Color\nThe following colors\noften emit the listed emotions:\nBlue:\nSecurity/integrity\n     or tranquility/peace\nGreen:\nFreshness/ environmental\nYellow:\nEnergy/cheerfulness\n     or caution\nPink:\nRomance,\n     beauty, love, or sensitivity\nRed:\nEnergy/passion\n     or danger/war\nHere at Light Up The Night, our creative team has studied the psychology of color for years giving us the insight and expertise to effectively design events. We will spend the necessary time planning and designing your event. Our\nLED lighting\nwill contrast every small detail, while radiating the desired energy. Professional stage lighting is an essential factor when planning your event, and we’ve got you covered.
