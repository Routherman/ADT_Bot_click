When it is available it will be posted under the \"rentals available\" tab.\nLease:\nOur leases are 12 months. We have found that 12 month leases allow for a more stable community and the lease is enforced.\nApplication Process:\nApplicants must undergo a screening process to verify they have no drug, crime or serious credit problems and will be a good neighbor to the rest of our residents. This includes verifying rental history, a complete criminal background check, and income verification. This process is usually conducted within 48 hours of our receipt of your completed application, the cost is $45 app fee (per adult.)\nPets:\nWe love cats and dogs. However, they don’t always treat our homes with equal love. Therefore, we unfortunately cannot allow pets inside, outside or visiting.\nSmoking:\nWe prefer non-smoking residents. However, if you smoke you cannot smoke inside the home. Also, do not throw your butts on the ground.
