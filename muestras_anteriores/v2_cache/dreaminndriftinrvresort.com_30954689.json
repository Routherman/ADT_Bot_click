Our journey into the world of RV living began when we embarked on a monumental 13,500-mile trip across the United States in our Journey DL Winnebago. This incredible experience deepened our love for the RV lifestyle and the wonderful community that surrounds it.\nEmbracing the simplicity and tranquillity that comes with this lifestyle, we transitioned into full-timers, trading the bustle of traditional home life for the serene embrace of nature. Our experiences on the road helped us recognize the importance of well-appointed RV parks, especially those that cater to the needs of our furry friends like our Labradoodle, Khloe.\nDreaming of creating an RV park that included larger lot sizes, a pool, and a pet-friendly area, we spent a year searching for the perfect location. Our pursuit led us to a charming 33-acre pasture, shadowed by majestic century-old live oaks, located conveniently close to the expressway and local shopping areas, yet sufficiently tucked away to provide a peaceful retreat in Lake City, Florida.\nOur vision for Dreamin’ ‘n ‘Driftin’ is simple: we want to build a welcoming RV community, combining friendly neighbors, engaging activities, and affordable rates. It’s not just an RV park; it’s a place we’d love to call home.\nWhether you’re planning long-term, seasonal, or just an overnight stay, we look forward to welcoming you into our community and becoming neighbors.\nSincerely,\nPaula and Bobby\n.entry-content .clear\n#post-##\n.entry-header\nMeet Bobby & Paula\nDreamin’ ‘n ‘Driftin’ RV Resort is the brainchild of my husband, Bobby, and me, Paula.
