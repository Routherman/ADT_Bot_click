As soon as he came over the Jolley Bridge he felt like he was home. John decided to make Marco Island his home in 1995 after visiting his sister Teresa who is also a Marco resident. They  both have raised their own children here as well. John has 1 son Shane. Moose has 3 children, Michael, Sean, and Shannon. Moose’s son Michael “Snackz” O’Regan bought out one of the original Irish owners Paddy McDonagh from County Galway. Mike grew up here on Marco Island and loved every bit of growing up in paradise.\nHOW IT STARTED - The original Irish trio of ownership started Paddy Murphy's in downtown Naples in 1998.  It started out as just beer and wine, and eventually added a full liquor license and that really set the stage for what we have today. Throw in some live music, especially from Moose alongside his wife Mary Jo, and there was definitely a recipe for success.\nNEW BEGINNINGS - After 22 years of business at the downtown location, the lease came to an end during Covid in 2020.  We searched far and wide and finally came to the conclusion of coming back home to Marco Island.  We are excited to have a new fresh spot to start over that is almost double in size of the old one.  We will have our own kitchen this time around and hope to bring in some Irish fare. The cocktails, wine, and beer will still be flowing as usual and the music will still be a-rocking.\nEnd Section 2\nStart Section 4 Custom section\nEnd  Section 4 Custom section\nStart Section 3\nContact us:\nby phone\n(239)-388-4099,\nby email\nmoosepaddymurphys@gmail.com\nEnd Section 3\nStart Section 1\nPaddy Murphy's Irish Pub\nslideshow start stop playing\nDot slide navigation number 1\nDot slide navigation number 2\nDot slide navigation number 3\nprevious slide\nnext slide\nPaddy Murphy's Irish Pub\nEnd Section 1\nStart Section 2\nAbout us\nMichael “Moose” O’Regan hails from Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland, and Johnny “Spoons” McNaboe comes from Gowna, County Cavan and they both emigrated  to New York City in the mid-1980s. Moose moved to Marco Island in 1988 after a vacation to the island.
