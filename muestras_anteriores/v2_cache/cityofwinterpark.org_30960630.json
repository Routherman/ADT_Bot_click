With its rich heritage, strong sense of community, vast parks system, diverse economic base, and beautiful chain of lakes, the city provides a high quality of life to both its residents and visitors alike.\nLocated just three miles north of Orlando in Orange County, the city is 10-square miles with over 30,000 residents. Winter Park is known for its Old World charm, elegant homes, quaint bricked streets, extensive tree canopy, first-class shopping and dining experiences, world-class museums and Rollins College.\nDescribed by some as a small New England village with a European flavor with quaint shops and scrumptious restaurants, Winter Park is as beautiful as it is unique. In addition to its town-and-gown relationship with Rollins College, the oldest private college in Florida, the city has developed significant partnerships among area businesses, schools, cultural organizations, civic groups and neighborhood associations.\nWinter Park is not only known for its abundance of upscale shopping and unique restaurants, but also its historic Hannibal Square district, Winter Park Village and nationally-ranked schools which include Winter Park High School, Rollins College and Valencia Community College. With four museums, The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art, Cornell Fine Arts Museum at Rollins College, Albin Polasek Museum & Sculpture Gardens and Winter Park Historical Museum, Winter Park is a Mecca for those interested in world-class art and rich cultural experiences.\nOne of the best ways to get acquainted with the city is to take a leisurely boat ride on the Winter Park Scenic Boat Tour, located at the east end of Morse Boulevard. This one-hour, open-air cruise will provide you with breathtaking views of our city’s beautiful homes and expansive chain of lakes as you listen to a narrated history of Winter Park. You can also take a walking tour of the city by picking up a brochure at the Winter Park Historical Museum located at the corner of New York and New England avenues on the north end of the award-winning Winter Park Farmers’ Market.\nThe Downtown Winter Park Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the official list of the nation’s most historic areas worthy of preservation. The district, which runs along Park Avenue, was deemed significant in the areas of early settlement, architecture, community planning, commerce and transportation. Eight buildings in Winter Park are also listed on the National Register of Historical Places, including the Albin Polasek Museum & Sculpture Gardens, All Saints Episcopal Church, Annie Russell Theatre, Comstock-Harris House, Edward Hill Brewer House – ‘The Palms,’ Knowles Memorial Chapel at Rollins College, Winter Park Country Club Clubhouse and Woman’s Club of Winter Park.\nAmong the city’s 75 beautiful large and small parks, the main parks include Central Park, Mead Botanical Garden, Kraft Azalea Garden, Ward Memorial Park, Lake Baldwin Park, Shady Park and Martin Luther King, Jr. Park. Be sure to make plans to attend the nationally-recognized Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival during the third weekend in March, the Winter Park Autumn Art Festival during the second weekend in October, the Old Fashioned 4th of July Celebration, and many other community and city-sponsored events that are held throughout the year.\nWe are sure you’ll agree after visiting our parks, shops, restaurants, museums, historic sites and other points of interest throughout the city, that the City of Winter Park is truly a unique community with an international appeal.\nWelcome to Winter Park\nCode of Ordinances & City Charter\nDemographics\nFee Schedule\nInfo Sheet\nResident Survey Results\nResident Survey Results\n2011\nCommunity Conversations Executive Summary\n2008\nExecutive Summary\nDetailed Written Report\n2006\nSurvey Results\nResident Survey Questions\nVision Postcard\n2005\nSurvey Results\n2004\nSurvey Results\nAbout\nContact Us\nHistory\nPerformance Measurements\nOur Vision\nWinter Park is the city of arts and culture, cherishing its traditional scale and charm while building a healthy and sustainable future for all generations.\nYou’re now leaving cityofwinterpark.org\nThe City of Winter Park Privacy Policy and Terms of Use does not apply to the site you are about to visit.
