We belong to International Festival Events Association, Florida Festival Events Association, and our local Chamber and Alliance for the Arts. The annual Festival Events Association Conventions, behind-the-scene trips to events, frequent calls with festival directors, and local training keep us up-to-date with best practices and innovative ideas.\nArtFest Supports the Community\nArtFest Fort Myers is committed to supporting the community that supports us.\nAs one of our community's most popular, well-known, and respected arts organizations, we are ever-aware of our responsibility to be involved in the success of art and culture throughout the area.
