      "text": "ABOUT US\nThe Irish Eatery You Have Waited For is Here\nHome\nAbout Us\nABOUT US\nStephies Pub & Irish Eatery in Apopka FL Serving Smiling Faces Since 2022\nIn 2022 Stephie and Paddy decided to move to Florida, enjoy the warmer temperatures and be around the many Florida friends they made over the years. Oh and enjoy avoiding the harsh winters of course.\nThey were looking for a business to buy to contribute to their new home in America and hire Americans and they found this great city with this location for sale.\nHaving retired, they set about creating a comfortable, safe Irish pub that featured great traditional Irish pub food but not using grease fryers, grills but using air fryers, panini grills and convection ovens for a much healthier result. This is their success story.\nCozy Place\nWhere you feel at home, like “Cheers” & find your Irish!\nPro Bartenders\nAsk about our Drink Specials…and Colin’s Creative Cocktails!\nOrder Now\nFree delivery\nup to 5 miles, on orders above $30.\n0\n+\nYears Of Experiences\nCozy Place\nWhere you feel at home, like “Cheers” & find your Irish!\nPro Bartenders\nAsk about our Drink Specials…and Colin’s Creative Cocktails!\nStephie is a Canadian girl from Ottawa Canada\nStephie has run small and medium businesses, including two very successful B&Bs. This is her third pub, first solely owned, serving great meals and drinks in a relaxed setting.\nPaddy's Irish Pub in the 1,000 Islands, Canada\nStephie and her husband Paddy opened Paddy’s Pub in the 1,000 Islands, Canada, gaining fame as a live music venue and being featured in magazines like National Geographic Traveler.\nPaddy's Pub and Irish Eatery in Kerrville TX\nIn 2005 they opened a second pub with the same success in Kerrville Texas called: Paddy’s Pub & Irish Eatery. After retiring in 2013 they moved to New Brunswick in 2020.\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST\nChef Paddy Savage\nPaddy has been the food industry since the 1970s and was the youngest liquor licensee in Canada. This chef who was certified as a Chef Garde Manger & Saucier has owned restaurants near Ottawa, Canada, The Crows Nest in Grand Cayman, and the two Paddys Pubs.\nOUR MONTHLY NEWLETTER\nSIGN UP TODAY!\nOUR MONTHLY NEWLETTER\nSIGN UP TODAY!\nWe pride ourselves in providing a laid-back upscale pub with lounge seating for having a drink and long conversations.
