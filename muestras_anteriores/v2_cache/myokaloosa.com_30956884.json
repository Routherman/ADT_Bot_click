For decades we have been captivated by the white sandy beaches of Destin and Okaloosa Island, the eclectic atmosphere of the Fort Walton Beach area; the history, forests and waterways of Crestview and Baker; and the commerce and sense of community in areas like Niceville and Shalimar. In addition to the nine municipalities that make up Okaloosa County, our community is home to the military members and families of Eglin Air Force Base, Hurlburt Field and Duke Field. The United States Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard Presence diversify, enhance and preserve our community and natural resources. Many visit but we’re fortunate enough to call Okaloosa County home.\nWe have numerous accolades for our soft, white, sandy beaches that include “Best Beach, Best Family Destination and Best Place to Boat,” to name a few. Acclamations are from media outlets such as USA Today, Southern Living, Travelocity, the Travel Channel and most recently, Okaloosa County made the top ten list for “Best Places for Business & Careers,” by Forbes Business Institute.\nMajor economic indicators include tourism and military, while community leaders are consistently striving for more economic diversity. The success of the tourism industry has provided additional environmental resources through the development of a Marine Resources division of the TDD leading projects including invasive species management, our artificial reef program and beach nourishment initiatives. Citizens were presented with the opportunity and voted to approve the expansion of tourism development or “bed tax” countywide in October 2021.\nOkaloosa County’s three airports have another significant impact on the local economy. Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport (VPS) is a joint-use facility established on Eglin Air Force Base in 1957.  This valuable relationship with Eglin assists our military with convenient, affordable air travel, thereby benefitting local residents as well. With the recent addition of Southwest Airlines, the airport flies direct to more than 50 cities.\nThe Bob Sikes Airport in Crestview and the Destin Executive Airport are equally diverse, with Crestview rising as a hub of industry, accommodating aerospace industrial applications from across the globe. Bob Sikes Airport recently welcomed the Hsu Foundation’s Aviation Center for Excellence supporting the next generation of STEM education innovators.\nWhile working to meet housing and traffic improvement needs, the County is actively working to expand broadband Internet access by installing 60 miles of fiber in north Okaloosa County, funded by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). The County is also closely monitoring and guiding the influx of companies installing additional fiber for residents countywide.\nTourism bed tax revenue has continued to be an asset for the County. Collections from the voter-approved expanded bed tax district began in FY 2023 and plans are underway to utilize that funding for tourism-related capital investments countywide. Additionally, bed tax revenue has assisted in the acquisition of properties for additional public parks, including a property on the Santa Rosa Sound in Mary Esther, a parcel of land next to the Shalimar Bridge, Phase II of Veterans Park, and the continued work on the Crystal Beach and Tarpon Beach accesses in Destin. The artificial reef program is also thriving as more large vessels are deployed that are benefitting divers, and the fishing industry while simultaneously creating a sustainable ecosystem for marine life.\nThe innovative design, future growth enhancements and overall technology of these facilities and projects are setting a new standard for economic excellence. The five elected Okaloosa County Commissioners are dedicated to connecting our communities and providing essential services, public safety, and quality of life for the county’s citizens and for future generations.\nSidebar Left\nEnd Sidebar Left\nSidebar Right\nCounty Admin\nCounty Administration\nMeet County Administrator - John Hofstad\nMeet The Deputy County Administrator - Craig Coffey\nMeet The Deputy County Administrator - Sheila Fitzgerald\nMeet the Deputy County Administrator- Jason Autrey\nOrganizational Chart\nAnnual Report\nPublic Notices\nAdministrative Policies\nPhone Directory\nEnd Sidebar Right\nJohn Hofstad\nCounty Administrator\n1250 N Eglin Pkwy\nSuite 102\nShalimar, FL 32579\nPhone:\n(850) 651-7515\nFax:\n(850) 651-7551\nEmail:managerinfo@myokaloosa.com\nADA Website Accessibility\nTitle VI/Nondiscrimination Assurance\nPrescription discount card\nEconomic Development\nCommunity Links\nFlood Information\nAttainable Workforce Housing Strategic Plan\nBuilding Code Changes\nLocal Mitigation Strategy (2021)\nNorth Okaloosa Planning Study\nNonprofit Funding Policy\nShort-term rental resource\nWomen Veterans Monuments at Veterans Park\nSite Map\nCounty Commission Office Locations\n:\n302 N.
