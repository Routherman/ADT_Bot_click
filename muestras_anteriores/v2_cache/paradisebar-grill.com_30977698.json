      "text": "Louisiana LeRoux on September 1, 2025\nTheir 1978 Capitol press release read, \"LeRoux takes its name from the Cajun French term for the thick and hearty gravy base that's used to make a gumbo.\"  LeRoux's eponymous first album was a musical gumbo that blended various instruments and music arrangements into a spicy, mouth-watering southern rock sound. Their Southern anthem 'New Orleans Ladies', voted Song of the Century by Gambit Magazine, simmered with the laid-back feel of the \"Big Easy,\" evoking images of Bourbon Street and the bayou.\nFollowing the success of the first album, the group released 'Keep the Fire Burning' in 1979 and 'UP' in 1980.  In 1981, LeRoux recorded 'Last Safe Place' for RCA Records, which became the band’s highest charting album.  Hits spawned from this recording included 'Addicted' (#3 Mainstream Rock), 'Nobody Said It Was Easy' (#18 Hot 100), and 'Last Safe Place' (#77 Hot 100).  The band completed their second album for RCA in 1983, 'So Fired Up'.\nThis era marked the advent of MTV, and LeRoux was in the forefront, filming several videos that made their debut on that music channel.  In addition, LeRoux performed on Solid Gold, The Midnight Special, and Don Kirchner's Rock Concert, the late-night television music shows that were so popular at that time.\nOver the years, LeRoux enjoyed performing with many of classic rocks' greatest bands, including The Allman Brothers, Wet Willie, Journey, Kansas, Heart, The Doobie Brothers, Charlie Daniels, Foreigner, Marshall Tucker, The Outlaws, ZZ Top, and many, many more.\nWho:\nLouisiana's LeRoux\nWhen:\nMonday, September, 2025\nTime:\n5:30 PM\nWhere:\nParadise Bar & Grille on Pensacola Beach\nSocial Share\nShare this article on Facebook\nShare this article on Twitter\nShare this article on LinkedIn\nEmail this article to a friend\nOther Events\nPolyrhythmics on October 18, 2025\nMusicians Memorial on Friday, September 5, 2025\nLouisiana LeRoux on September 1, 2025\nReceive news on specials and events!\nWe truly care about our users and our product.\nEmail\n*\nSubscribe\nGoogle ReCaptcha\nThis is for invisible recaptcha only.
