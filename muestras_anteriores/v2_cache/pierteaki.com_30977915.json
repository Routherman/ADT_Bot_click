Whether you're sharing a romantic evening or enjoying a night out with friends, our rooftop tiki bar guarantees unforgettable moments. Guests must be 21 or older after 8pm.\nShop Gift Cards\nTake a glance at\nThe Pier Teaki Menu\nTake a glance at\nThe Pier Teaki Menu\nLearn about our\nService Charge\nLearn More\nOur aim is to professionalize one of the only industries in the world that has no guaranteed income for the service provider, (i.e., the hospitality industry). We have adopted a service model that utilizes a sales commission for every dollar sold for an employee, regardless of discount. This commission-based system has been in use for decades.\nWe are proud to continue setting a high standard for employee compensation in the vibrant Florida restaurant industry. Our company’s legacy is built on the belief that legendary service is provided by a team – not just one person. It is shown in every detail of the Teak LLC experience. Ever since opening in 2020, we have been committed to compensating all employees, both front and back of the house, as the professionals they are. This model ensures that our team will thrive, our guests will continue to receive an outstanding experience and our company is well-positioned for the future.\nLearn about our\nService Charge\nLearn More\nOur aim is to professionalize one of the only industries in the world that has no guaranteed income for the service provider, (i.e., the hospitality industry).

This model ensures that our team will thrive, our guests will continue to receive an outstanding experience and our company is well-positioned for the future.\nWhat is a service charge?\nA 20% service charge is included on each check. Teak LLC retains 100% of the service charge.\nDoes this mean that your servers will make less?\nNo. This model was implemented in Seattle almost two years ago and in Dunedin a year and a half ago so we have extensive data which tells us that it is working well for staff, guests, and the companies. Our servers and bartenders are paid a commission and there is a revenue share model for the rest of the service team. The result is that the whole team benefits from delighting our guests from the moment they arrive until they leave us for the night. Our entire team will do as well or better with this model. Our professional service team receives industry-leading compensation including commissions on sales, health insurance, matched 401K, and extensive education and training for a successful career path.\nAre you also raising prices?\nNo. In fact, we are developing ways to add even more value to our guests by not having to raise prices due to labor costs.\nWhat will you do if a guest is upset about their service?\nWe know that excellent service is provided by a team – not just one person. It is shown in every detail of the Teak LLC experience and all our people are dedicated to providing that. We stand behind what we do. If a guest is not delighted – we will make it right. That’s what we have always done.\nWill employees still be rewarded for a job well done?\nOur servers and bartenders are paid a commission and there is a revenue share model for the rest of the service team. The result is that the whole team benefits from delighting our guests from the moment they arrive until they leave us for the night. Our entire team will do as well or better with this model. In addition, we provide health insurance to our team and their families (at 25 hours a week.) We have a great 401K with matching program and a career path with extensive training opportunities. We really want people to build their careers with us. That is why we invest so much in training and development so that our team grows and thrives.\nWhat if there is a problem with my experience?\nIf there is any aspect of your experience that does not exceed expectations, we will make it right.\nWhat if I still want to leave a tip?\nAdditional gratuities are accepted but not expected.\nYou guys are already so expensive, isn’t this going to scare people off?\nThis percentage is already in line with what most of our guests were leaving as a gratuity. Our guests come here because they know they are getting the very best service. Now it is just inclusive in the bill. They don’t have to do the math. It’s just part of what we do.\nIs this going to help with the disparity between front of the house and kitchen compensation?\nOur company culture doesn’t work that way. We have always paid well and provided great benefits to all of our employees. It is part of why people love working here. We respect our employees for the pros they are. We pay them well; we provide health insurance to our team and their families. We have a great 401K with matching program and a career path with extensive training opportunities. We really want people to build their careers with us. That is why we invest so much in training and development so that our team grows and thrives.\nWhat has the reaction been from employees?\nWe have been talking to our team for a while now about this and have taken their input to heart and I believe they know that we are absolutely committed to making sure they do as well or better than they did before. Our team is made up of professionals who have made hospitality their career and they count on doing well here because they have families, they are homeowners, they are active members of their community.\nTeaki Huts & Large Events\nAt Pier Teaki, there are a few options for hosting private events.
