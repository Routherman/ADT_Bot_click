BubbaQue's specializes in expertly smoked cuts of pork, beef, and chicken, accompanied by freshly prepared Southern side dishes made from traditional recipes and quality ingredients. The restaurant's origin story dates back to the 1950s, when Ethel and Jed, proud parents of their only child, Bubba, fostered a warm atmosphere centered around good food, laughter, and the formation of lasting friendships that felt like family.\nAt BubbaQue's, the spirit of community is paramount. Every Sunday at their home, Ethel and Jed hosted gatherings filled with good company, sweet tea, and, most importantly, exceptional barbecue. Uncle Jed was particularly proud of his barbecue, earning numerous trophies and accolades for his skill. His impressive smoker became a centerpiece for family celebrations, from weddings to baptisms.\nAs Bubba learned the art of barbecue from Uncle Jed, he absorbed the essence of their gatherings—inviting good people to share delicious food and fun, transforming friends into family. \n                                          Today, BubbaQue's carries forward this legacy of great food and warm hospitality, inviting everyone to experience the joy of Southern barbecue.
