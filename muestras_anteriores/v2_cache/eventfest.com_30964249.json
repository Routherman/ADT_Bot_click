      "text": "Darrell Stefany\nFounder and President\nDarrell Stefany is an event marketing and management executive who produced his first event in 1981. While playing professional Jai alai, Darrell started working at EventMakers in 1991. While producing corporate and retail events throughout the southeast, Darrell has primarily been responsible for the development, management and production of “Community” events – from historic and memorable events like FreedomFest (July 4th) to Flags Along Bayshore – Tampa’s Remembrance of 9/11 to annually one of the largest Community events in the country – Tampa’s historic Gasparilla celebration.\nGasparilla has grown to include a six-week series of events in Tampa, and includes three signature events developed, marketed and produced by EventFest in Tampa: the Children’s Gasparilla Extravaganza, the Seminole Hard Rock Gasparilla Pirate Fest and Gasparilla’s Outbound Voyage.\nDarrell is Past-Chair of the\nFlorida Festival and Event Association (FFEA)\n, and recipient of\nFFEA’s\nSUNsational Award in 2004 recognizing their Event Professional of the Year.\nDarrell is a member of the\nFlorida Festivals and Events Association\n, SMEI Tampa Bay, Visit Tampa Bay, the Tampa Downtown Partnership and Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce.\nDillon Stefany\nVice President\nEvents and Production\nFrom early mornings in Ybor City helping his dad with the Outback Bowl Pep Rally setup, to helping run shuttle transports in a golf cart at Gasparilla, Dillon grew up helping at events within the family business.\nDillon began his professional career in management of Multi Family Housing in Tallahassee, Florida. While living and working full time in Tallahassee, he would frequently drive home to Tampa, FL to help produce events for EventFest, Inc.\nHe moved home to Tampa to begin full time work at EventFest, Inc. in the Spring of 2016. Dillon is a Senior Project Manager and the head of our Event Production team specializing in on site logistics and contractor management. From the first day our events start their build out until the last piece of equipment has been removed from the event site, he and his production team, (who we refer to as #TeamNoSleep) work tirelessly to ensure that our events run as smoothly as possible. Dillon currently manages Pig on the Pond in Clermont, FL, Santa’s Grand Arrival Parade at UTC Sarasota, and manages the Gasparilla Air Invasion in association with the Children’s Gasparilla event.\nIn his spare time, Dillon can be found on the golf course or out on the water in Tampa Bay.\nMcKenzie Pruitt\nEvent Manager\nMcKenzie is a Chicago native and University of Iowa graduate. She spent the first part of her career juggling her favorite things; food, sports, and events, while working with The Chicago Blackhawks and on Lou Malnati’s marketing team. Through that time not only did her passion for events flourish, but she emerged as an admitted “pizza snob.”\nFrom there McKenzie moved to Tampa, FL. to work for The IRONMAN Group, where she started organizing and executing events throughout the country. Her event portfolio grew to over 100+ events. She worked on everything from developing new concepts, building relationships with partners and vendors, working alongside production crew, executing customer experience, and more.\nOver the years Tampa has become home to this Midwest-girl in more ways than “y’all” becoming part of her vocabulary. She is excited to bring to life everything the Tampa Bay region has to offer. Through her years in the industry, she has learned to respond calmly and adapt quickly. Her attention to detail and problem-solving skills are what gives her success in her role.\nLeisurely she can be found watching sports or enjoying the outdoors alongside her supportive husband, adorable baby boys and energetic dogs.\nShawn Fordham\nEvent Manager\nAs a student at Florida State University, Shawn could typically be found in the athletic facilities working with the Athletic Facilities & Event Management department. He then moved into the role of Graduate Assistant where he managed a group of Athletic Assistants in the production of all major sporting events and other various events at the University.\nShawn has spent the last 5+ years in Atlanta, GA working as a Supply Chain/Financial Analyst. This change of pace was crucial in developing strong analytical/budgeting skills, but Event Management has always been his passion. Working freelance with EventFest for the last decade, Shawn has long been a part of Team EventFest.\nIf Shawn is not found running around the event site, he is likely to be found on the golf course or spending the day with his wife and two dogs.\nCarla Perez\nEvent Manager\nCarla is a Tampa native who has been planning events for half a decade. She majored in Hospitality Management, (and college football) at The University of Alabama and then made her way back to the Tampa Bay Area!\nCarla orchestrated unforgettable moments as the Event Manager at Hotel Zamora, crafting corporate events, private parties, and fairytale weddings.\nCarla has worked on dozens of iconic Tampa events over the years… Her favorite being Gasparilla! On the weekends you'll catch her cheering on the Bucs or enjoying quality time with her husband and their two adorable pups. Where there's excitement, creativity, and a touch of Tampa magic, Carla is there!\nDarrell Stefany\nFounder and President\nDarrell Stefany is an event marketing and management executive who produced his first event in 1981.
