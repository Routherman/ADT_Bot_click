Loving the game of golf since age four, after his father cut down an old seven iron to swing at plastic balls in the yard. From that point forward, playing competitive junior golf and tournament baseball consumed all summers. James may have gotten his love of golf and baseball naturally from his cousin’s side of the family, PGA winner, J.C. Snead, who also played pro baseball. Having a successful junior golf and baseball career sparked interest to stay connected to the sports as an adult.\nJames has worked in and around golf since he was 16. Starting on the grounds crew as a teen, then serving as Assistant Golf Professional, Head Professional, and Director of Golf in Virginia. James joined the PGA in 1999, and also competed sparingly on mini-tour circuits in the 90’s. Coaching and paying it forward to the community became a priority as he coached for over 20 seasons, high school and collegiately. Bringing state championships in golf to his alma mater was rewarding, recognized as VHSL coach of the year, and Virginia Sports writers coach of the year. James also coached girls varsity softball for several seasons. James quoted “The real reward is the relationships with the players and how you may have had a positive effect on their lives in some way”.\nJames also served his community as Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, Athletic Director, Special Events Coordinator, Director of Aquatics, Facilities Director, in addition to many board appointments. James also worked as a consultant to distressed golf properties. James attended James Madison University (Summa Cum Laude) and Harvard Business School.\nRecently retiring from the state of Virginia after 25 years of service, James and his family made the decision to move to Wellen Park in August 2024. Wellen proved to be the perfect place for good schools, golf, beach, and baseball. The family discovered the area attending a Braves game at CoolToday Park and fell in love. His lovely wife Shelly works from home in the banking industry, their oldest daughter Kinley, is a rising eighth-grader and London is their free spirited three year old. The entire family loves watching baseball and football with Chi-Chi and Lilly (cats), cheering for the Braves and Packers! James also lived another life in the music industry, but that is for another day.\n“It has been my pleasure getting to meet all of the members here and working with the staff. I truly enjoy getting back to the course and offering my experience in the industry to the club.”\nFor more information regarding instruction or to book a lesson, please e-mail\nkwagner@theiconteam.com\nor\njcorbett@theiconteam.com\nHome\nGolf\nTEE TIMES\nCourse Details\nRates\nFacilities\nInstruction\nLennar Family Golf\nDining\nCalendar\nReal Estate\nContact\nContact Us\nE Club Signup\nLearn from the Pros & improve your golf game at Wellen Park Golf & Country Club, a great setting to focus on perfecting all aspects and reaching towards your personal goals.\nWellen Park Golf & CC Instruction is led by Head Golf Professional Kristina Wagner, Class-A LPGA Professional with over 15 years experience in coaching and teaching players of all ages and skill levels.\nOur goal is to create uniquely driven lessons based on student goals and abilities.  Whether you are picking up a club for the first time or are looking to take your game to the next competitive level, we can help you create a path to success.\nChoose your own lesson style with options of booking a 1-on-1 private lesson, group lessons of 2-8 people or register for group clinics offered periodically.\nRATES\nPrivate Lessons\n30 Minutes – $45\n60 Minutes – $80\nOn Course Lessons\n1 Hour each\n3 or more holes – $90 (afternoons only)\nGroup Lessons\n1 Hour each\n2 people – $90\n3 people – $100\nIt is $10 for each additional person participating and up to 8 students total can create a group lesson\nINSTRUCTORS\nKristina Wagner, Head Golf Professional\nkwagner@theiconteam.com\nJames Corbett, 1st Assistant Golf Professional\njcorbett@theiconteam.com\nMeet James Corbett, our First Assistant Golf Professional.
