The State constitution gives the BCC the power to adopt ordinances (local laws), approve the County budget, set property tax millages and establish the requirements for the departments under its control. The Board governs all unincorporated areas of the county directly. (\nFull list of powers and responsibilities.\n)\nThe BCC does not have control of the budgets or policies of the School Board. The BCC approves support funding for court services, insofar as County funds are concerned, and approves the budgets of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the Sheriff and the Supervisor of Elections. Budgets for the Tax Collector and the Property Appraiser are approved by the State Department of Revenue and filed with the BCC.\nThe commissioners also serve on other Boards for the County, such as the Affordable Housing Advisory Committee, Early Learning Coalition of Pinellas, Health and Human Services Leadership Board and the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority.
