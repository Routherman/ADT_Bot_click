In the early 1950’s J.B. “Brandy” Siebenaler, a well-respected marine researcher and graduate of the University of Miami’s Marine Laboratory, had a vision to display marine life in a way that visitors to this area had never seen before. Brandy sold the developers of northwest Florida the idea that Fort Walton Beach needed an aquarium, a tourist attraction and scientific research center.\nIn early 1954, the Gulfarium was incorporated by fifteen scientists at the University of Miami and fifty local residents. Today, many of the stockholders at the Gulfarium are the same, or their heirs, as they were back then.\nLearn More\nGulfarium Marine Adventure Park has entertained millions since its inception in 1955.

Today, many of the stockholders at the Gulfarium are the same, or their heirs, as they were back then.\nIn September of 1954, construction began on a 600-foot stretch of Okaloosa Island in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The main dolphin habitat took 11 months to develop and built entirely from battleship steel originally from Mississippi. In August of 1955, the Gulfarium opened its doors for the first time with admission prices at $1 for adults and $0.50 for children.\nIn the beginning, the main habitat contained multiple animal species including sharks, dolphins, rays, and sea turtles. This habitat doubled as both the dolphin show and the Living Sea exhibit with a daily shark feeding demonstration on SCUBA gear. Glass portholes at varying levels gave the visitor the impression of actually being in the sea with the marine life.\nDespite knowing that their main attraction animals were actually called dolphins, the trainers referred to them as porpoises so not to confuse the public with the dolphin fish that they consumed. These “porpoises” were trained to jump high to ring dinner bells and collect fish from the trainers hand or even mouth.\nIn 1956, a separate Living Sea exhibit was built, providing another view “under the sea” with daily dive demonstrations led by Gulfarium staff. This was the first aquarium of its time to feature viewing windows that stretched from the sea floor to the water’s surface. While common now, this was groundbreaking at the time. Throughout the years, additional habitats and exhibits have been added including sea lions, seals, otters, alligators, and exotic birds.\nThe Gulfarium’s extensive history of shows and demonstrations continues to this day, with the recent addition of close-up animal encounters, providing our visitors with a new dimension of discovering sea life.\nCelebrating 65 years of care\nIn 2020, Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park celebrated its 65th anniversary. As one of the world’s oldest marine animal parks, we are thrilled to celebrate many milestones including:\nThe first marine park to perform underwater shows on SCUBA gear, rather than the traditional full-helmet dive gear of the era.\nThe first to record a dolphin jumping to a height of 21 feet.\nThe first to successfully raise a stranded baby bottlenose dolphin.\nThe first to develop a synthetic milk formula for bottlenose dolphins. This formula is still used today.\nThese are among many of the significant impact the Gulfarium has had on the community as well as the field of marine animal care and training.

Center has been awarded a grant for $20,306.25 from the Florida Sea Turtle Grants Program. The C.A.R.E Center received the grant to help purchase a new digital radiograph (DR) x-ray machine. This new item will benefit sea turtles in NW Florida and Alabama. Since purchasing the DR x-ray plate the C.A.R.E. Center has already successfully completed radiographs on 31 rehabilitated sea turtles, ranging in size from juvenile green sea turtles to adult loggerheads. The DR machine enables the animal care technicians at the C.A.R.E. Center to view an x-ray image instantaneously after taking the photo. This process gives the animal care team real time information allowing for instant analysis.\nThe Gulfarium C.A.R.E. Center was chosen for the award through a competitive application process that is open to coastal county governments, educational institutions and Florida-based nonprofit groups striving to improve the livelihood of sea turtles and conserve Florida habitats.\nLaunched in 1996, the “Helping Sea Turtles Survive” specialty license plate raises money for two important programs that benefit Florida sea turtles – the Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission’s Marine Turtle Protection Program and the Sea Turtle Grants Program, which distributes money back to the local level for turtle conservation projects. The sea turtle specialty plate is currently number two in sales, having sold 66,696 plates in 2010 – second only to the University of Florida specialty plate.\n“It’s rewarding to know that so many people share our concern for Florida’s sea turtles,” said David Godfrey, Sea Turtle Conservancy Executive Director. “What we do in this state has a dramatic impact on sea turtle populations around the world. By purchasing the sea turtle specialty plate, Floridians are voluntarily funding important programs to save these amazing creatures.” To learn more about the Sea Turtle Grants Program and the “Helping Sea Turtles Survive” specialty license plate, please visit www.helpingseaturtles.org.\n5 Comments\nHeidi howard\nFebruary 28, 2024 at 9:26 am\n- Reply\nI love this organization and I would love to be a part of your team how can I do that?
