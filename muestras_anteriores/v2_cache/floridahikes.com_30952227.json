Last admission 4:30 PM. Gates close 5:30 PM.  Dogs are not permitted.\nAll visitors must pass through the Blair Audubon Center, which offers a movie about the swamp, interpretive exhibits and wildlife art, a gift shop, and a snack bar. Pay your admission here.\nAdmission costs $14 adult, Audubon member $10, student with ID $6, ages 6-18 $4, under 6 free. Your admission is good for two back-to-back days, so you can show up one afternoon and come back the next morning.\nMosquitoes can be a problem any time of year, but especially in summer. Deer flies and yellow flies can also be an issue during late Apr-early Jun. Use repellent and wear long pants.\nVisitors are encouraged to walk clockwise around the loop trail. Interpretive markers help you gauge how far you’ve walked along the way.\nFor those who cannot do the whole 2.3 miles, a 0.7 mile boardwalk loop is available.\nWildlife uses the boardwalk too. One visitor filmed a Florida panther racing down the boardwalk.\nDirections\nFrom Interstate 75 exit 111 in Naples, Immokalee Road / Naples Park, drive east on CR 846. After 15.6 miles, turn left at the “Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary” sign onto CR 849. Follow this road for 1.5 miles, which makes a sharp left, until you see the parking sign for the sanctuary.

This wanton slaughter led to the formation of the first Audubon Society in 1896.\nLittle blue herons and other wading birds are now protected from hunting thanks to Audubon’s efforts\nReturning from the side trail, walk in the shade of the cypress strand. After a half mile, an observation platform on the prairie offers a good birding spot.\nThe boardwalk continues into the depths of the cypress strand, where giant strap ferns cast a primordial mood as they reflect in the inky shallows below.\nStrap ferns have feathery fronds\nRotting logs host colonies of fungi and ferns. You hear splashes in the shadows.\nPassing through a rain shelter, pause and watch for wildlife: small alligators, frogs, and turtles.

A platform just beyond the shelter looks over a flag pond where the birds are especially active.\nAll around you are enormous cypresses, many of which have equally gigantic strangler fig trees grappling with their trunks.

Continue eastward at the traffic circle, staying on Bonita Beach Rd SE for another mile, and the trailhead is located on the left side of the road.\nHike\nReached by three trailheads off Bonita Beach Rd, the trails of Flint Pen Strand offer a variety of habitats to traverse. Two start at the Main trailhead.\nThe Yellow Trail (5.9 miles in two parts) and the Red Trail (1.5 miles, detailed below) are loops. The Yellow Trail is open to equestrians.\nRed Trail between the pines\nAccessible from the those trails or from Pinewoods trailhead are the 2.9-mile Orange Trail loop and the 3.1-mile linear Purple Trail.\nThe Lakes trailhead at the end of Bonita Beach Rd also provides access to those trails as well as the “Lakes,” a series of borrow pits that make a great birding destination.\nHeron at the Lakes\nThe Purple Trail heads east through swampy terrain to Bird Rookery Swamp in Corkscrew Strand, connecting to the 7.7 mile loop within the strand.\nIt is possible to hike a 7-mile linear trek between Flint Pen Strand and Bird Rookery Swamp using the lower end of that loop and a car at each trailhead.\nParking signs point to the exit of Bird Rookery Swamp\nRed Trail\nStarting at the Main trailhead for the Red Trail, be sure to look at the kiosk for information about the property and pick up a map if needed.\nPassing through a gap in the fence, a bench sits next to a well-maintained path bordered by plumes of golden grass.\nTrailhead bench\nPalmettos grow in clusters on the grassy forest floor alongside wax myrtles, grapevines, and passionflowers.\nLeaving the pines at 0.2 miles, the trail enters a wide-open area before crossing an intersection with the yellow-blazed equestrian trail.\nPassionflower in bloom\nTo the west, pillars of tall, bone-white tree remnants rise from the horizon in stark contrast from the otherwise lush green landscape.\nThese are remains of the highly invasive and ecologically disruptive melaleuca tree, the removal of which is part of an ongoing habitat restoration project.\nMelaleuca remnants\nAt 0.6 mile, the trail enters a small hammock of live oaks and cabbage palms.

It is common to see anhingas, cormorants, herons, and ibis perched in trees and on the banks of this linear waterway.\nPay close attention to the trail markers here when the forest is flooded to avoid slipping into the deeper water.\nContinue following red blazed posts as the trail bends southward, completing the loop in a half mile.\nCanal views\nTrail Map\nRed: Red Trail.

Continue eastward at the traffic circle, staying on Bonita Beach Rd SE for another mile, and the trailhead is located on the left side of the road.\nHike\nReached by three trailheads off Bonita Beach Rd, the trails of Flint Pen Strand offer a variety of habitats to traverse. Two start at the Main trailhead.\nThe Yellow Trail (5.9 miles in two parts) and the Red Trail (1.5 miles, detailed below) are loops. The Yellow Trail is open to equestrians.\nRed Trail between the pines\nAccessible from the those trails or from Pinewoods trailhead are the 2.9-mile Orange Trail loop and the 3.1-mile linear Purple Trail.\nThe Lakes trailhead at the end of Bonita Beach Rd also provides access to those trails as well as the “Lakes,” a series of borrow pits that make a great birding destination.\nHeron at the Lakes\nThe Purple Trail heads east through swampy terrain to Bird Rookery Swamp in Corkscrew Strand, connecting to the 7.7 mile loop within the strand.\nIt is possible to hike a 7-mile linear trek between Flint Pen Strand and Bird Rookery Swamp using the lower end of that loop and a car at each trailhead.\nParking signs point to the exit of Bird Rookery Swamp\nRed Trail\nStarting at the Main trailhead for the Red Trail, be sure to look at the kiosk for information about the property and pick up a map if needed.\nPassing through a gap in the fence, a bench sits next to a well-maintained path bordered by plumes of golden grass.\nTrailhead bench\nPalmettos grow in clusters on the grassy forest floor alongside wax myrtles, grapevines, and passionflowers.\nLeaving the pines at 0.2 miles, the trail enters a wide-open area before crossing an intersection with the yellow-blazed equestrian trail.\nPassionflower in bloom\nTo the west, pillars of tall, bone-white tree remnants rise from the horizon in stark contrast from the otherwise lush green landscape.\nThese are remains of the highly invasive and ecologically disruptive melaleuca tree, the removal of which is part of an ongoing habitat restoration project.\nMelaleuca remnants\nAt 0.6 mile, the trail enters a small hammock of live oaks and cabbage palms. Ferns carpet the richer soils here, prospering under the shady canopy.\nAfter crossing an old manmade ditch, the path takes sharp turn to the right, meandering towards the Kehl canal.\nOak and palm hammock\nThe trail turns right in a tenth of a mile, following the canal eastward although the water is not visible through the dense shrubs bordering the trail.\nThudding and the laughter-like calls of pileated woodpeckers echo through the forest as they search for a meal in the treetops above.\nMixed forest alongside the canal\nReaching one mile, the trail takes a turn to follow alongside the canal. It is common to see anhingas, cormorants, herons, and ibis perched in trees and on the banks of this linear waterway.\nPay close attention to the trail markers here when the forest is flooded to avoid slipping into the deeper water.\nContinue following red blazed posts as the trail bends southward, completing the loop in a half mile.\nCanal views\nTrail Map\nRed: Red Trail.
