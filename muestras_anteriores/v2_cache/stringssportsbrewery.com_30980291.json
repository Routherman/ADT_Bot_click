Housed in a beautifully restored 1930s Art Deco building (Springfield) and in historic Terry’s Country Store (Jax Beach), our spacious venues blend the warmth of a scratch‑kitchen serving fan‑favorite dishes and an exciting array of house-brewed beers. Whether you’re shooting hoops under our full‑size basketball court, catching the game on big screens, or laughing over games with the kids, Strings offers something for everyone. Our cozy family-friendly atmosphere is all about good people, great brews, and shared memories. At Strings, we’re more than a brewery.

Bright and balanced with a floral, citrusy hop finish—this brew always delivers a clean out.\nGolden Sombrero\nA refreshing Mexican lager with a crisp finish and hint of sweetness.
