No gas, no electric assist (that means we start it old school.. wood & flame only) …. this oven is fueled with oak wood only at all times and we promise you’ll love the taste of your freshly made pizza and many more menu items because of it.\nThe vibe is dark, cool, sexy, the fire hot, the music loud.  It is what we have created, what we do and do not change it.  Just relax and enjoy.\nFavorite Pizzas… or Build Your Own\nThe Neapolitan Pizza oven’s average temperature is about 900 degrees, we do a 12″ pie cut into 6 slices and is meant to be “well done” with lots of char and leopard spots.   We have a variety of favorite pizzas to order—or you can create your own! Choose from any of our fresh ingredients. Enjoy our homemade dough, or our gluten-free cauliflower crust.  And yes, we have options for vegans like our vegan “mozzarella” cheese.\nHouse Eats Menu\nPizza Menu\nA Handful of Specialty & Artisan Options\nWhat Started Us is Still Here\nWe were the first  place in Key Largo to offer amazing cheese boards and imported meats as we have since 2016 when we first opened as Cork & Curds.\nImported Meats, cheeses, almonds, fig spread, crackers, truffle oil and honey are few fan favorites that appear on our charcuterie & cheeseboards.\nYou Can Take Us Home\nFind a bottle of wine you love? Take one home. We have the convenience factor of a wine & beer retail license and offer a discount on all products that you purchase to take out.\nWe are also happy to pre-order things buy the case for an even larger discount.  Just ask.\nIt’s all About\nReally Good Ingredients\nFor every plate and every drink, nothing compares to the punch of flavor that fresh ingredients offer.  Imported and Domestic Artisan stuff has been “our thing” since 2016.  We were THE first to bring Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch and many more imported cheeses and meats to Key Largo and continue to do so.\nWe love our Florida Keys and although seafood is not what we concentrate on, we do serve some pretty killer oysters and seafood as featured specials to please every palate.\nPlease email us for any large format platters, pizza orders or takeout options for any and all occasions.\nWe source locally as often as possible, too.\nC&C Restaurant & Bar in Key Largo\nCome in and experience the delight of a wood fired oven pizza, unique menu items, specialty cheeses & meats, and hand-selected wines and craft beers.\nHOURS\nSunday – Thursday\n4 PM ~ 10 PM\nFriday & Saturday\n4 PM ~ 11 PM\nHappy Hour\n4 ~ 6 PM Daily\nContact Us\nLocation\n99201 Overseas Hwy  Key Largo, Florida 33037\n(305) 451-0995\n/container\n/footer-widgets\n©2020 C&C.

Please contact us via email if interested\nCatering & Private Events\nIf you are looking to host a special event at our Key Largo restaurant and bar and have a large group, a full restaurant ” buy out’ is always an option.  We are very small and larger parties are not always easy to accommodate.  If you have interest in buying us out for a private event, please email us woodfiredovenkeylargo@gmail.com to begin the conversation.\nPlease email woodfireovenkeylargo@gmail.com with plenty of notice to discuss details.\nWe currently do not offer “traditional” catering for off-property events as we do not have the equipment necessary to prepare or keep food warm at venues.\nOur kitchen and staff are small so at this time, we choose to be a restaurant first but can offer menu items in a family-style format for pick up.\nWe Can Help\nCustomize Your Event\nWith a flexible menu and plenty of notice, the possibilities are really only limited by imagination. So email us to discuss customizable options for your event.\nOur Key Largo restaurant and bar is small and intimate, and is the perfect spot for events of any kind.\nIn other words… we’ve here for it, whatever you need.\nC&C Restaurant & Bar in Key Largo\nCome in and experience the delight of a wood fired oven pizza, unique menu items, specialty cheeses & meats, and hand-selected wines and craft beers.\nHOURS\nSunday – Thursday\n4 PM ~ 10 PM\nFriday & Saturday\n4 PM ~ 11 PM\nHappy Hour\n4 ~ 6 PM Daily\nContact Us\nLocation\n99201 Overseas Hwy  Key Largo, Florida 33037\n(305) 451-0995\n/container\n/footer-widgets\n©2020 C&C.
