This hotel (or Inn) is amazing. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room is amazing. Huge space, nice kitchen and supplies, balcony with a lot of chairs and table to sit and relax. King size bed was great and bathroom has 2 sinks - identical as photos. They offer 1 covered parking spot (in the summer or raining season, this make a difference). The Inn is right at the beach, in a private and nice place at Sanibel - away from the public beach area. My wife loved shelling in peace and found several shells to her collection. They offer chairs/umbrella at no cost. And bikes for rentals. Cleaning staff was great and service everyday. I stayed in Matthews Lodge Luxury suites.
