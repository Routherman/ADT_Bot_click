In the early days it was just Jimmy and Roger. Two acoustic guitars, and vocals. After a year on the road as a duo, and with the success of a hit song, Come Monday, it was clear a band was needed for the bigger venues they were playing, so Jimmy added Greg “Fingers” Taylor on harmonica and keyboard, Harry Dailey on bass and Phillip Fajardo on drums.\nRoger is also infamous as the singer and writer of the song Fool for a Blonde from the classic horror movie\n“The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,”\nand for the many incarnations of his own bands, and as lead guitarist for many artists from New York to Las Vegas.\nJOHN FRINZI:\nJohn Frinzi\nblends folk, pop and country, delivering a sunny, laid-back beach vibe. A gifted singer and songwriter, Frinzi has built an audience through craft and originality. An early demo caught the ear of legendary pedal steel guitarist\nDoyle Grisham\n, a longtime member of\nJimmy Buffett’s Coral Reefer Band\n, and their working relationship led to John’s first album, “Into The Dawn.” His second release, “Shoreline,” showcases Frinzi’s versatility as a songwriter and vocalist with many of the songs co-written by\nTom Corcoran\n, co-writer of the Buffett classics,“Fins,” and “Cuban Crime of Passion”. Most recently, John teamed up with multi-platinum songwriter and producer\nAaron Scherz\nto release “Blue Sky View.”\nSingles from all of these albums remain in regular rotation on Sirius/XM’s Radio Margaritaville. A seasoned live performer, Frinzi has toured nationally, performed in the Caribbean and Europe and has been featured at major festivals including Musikfest, The Keith Sykes Songwriters Celebration, Key West Songwriters Festival, Pensacola Beach Songwriters Festival and has shared the stage with acclaimed artists including Jesse Winchester, Mac McAnally, The Coral Reefer Band, Todd Snider and Maria Muldaur.\nDOYLE GRISHAM:\nDoyle Grisham\nhas had a distinguished career in the music industry since moving to Nashville in 1966.

One highlight that stands out from many memorable recordings were the sessions for a duet album where\nRandy Travis\ninvited several top artists to join him; some of those artists included\nRoy Rogers, Tammy Wynette, Chet Atkins, Dolly Parton, Kris Kristofferson, B.B. King, Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn\n, and more.\nIn 1999, Doyle began touring with\nJimmy Buffett & The Coral Reefer Band\nand played with his own band,\nThe Bandits\n, while recording Buffett’s “Beach House On The Moon.”\nHe was inducted into the Texas Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 2002 and joined\nThe Grinders Switch Ensemble\nin 2016.

Then, taking a short break from music, she represented\nThe California Angels\nbaseball organization as their on-air spokesperson in television commercials, appearing at games and various charity events as Miss California Angel.\nNext came performances with local bands, “Star Search” and music videos. She was featured in what became an early MTV favorite,\nJohn Waite’s\n“Change.” More local bands and studio vocal work followed, including sessions for\nTori Amos, Martika\nand\nBill Medley\namong others.
