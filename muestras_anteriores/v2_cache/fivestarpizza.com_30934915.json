      "text": "about\nfck\nWhy Us?\n​At Five Star Pizza, we are passionate about our pizzas. We work relentlessly to source the best possible ingredients, regardless of cost. From our Wisconsin mozzarella cheese to our California fresh packed tomatoes, our real meat toppings, no soy or fillers, our fresh sliced vegetables, sourced locally when possible. We proudly serve Springer Mountain Farms all natural chicken wings - no antibiotics, no steroids, no growth stimulants, no hormones.\nIn addition to the very best ingredients, we make pizza the way pizza was meant to be made - hand tossed with fresh dough made in each store every day. Cheese shredded and vegetables sliced daily with great care. But we couldn't deliver the best pizzas without the best staff - the friendliest people to take your order, make your pizza, and deliver it faster than you thought possible!\nOur History​\n​ John Gillespie opened the first Five Star Pizza in Gainesville, Florida in 1988. The mission was to deliver a great pizza fast, any time of the day or night. Soon, it became the University of Florida students’ favorite. Building on the overwhelming success of the first location, a second location opened in Gainesville operated by brothers Steve and Paul. A third location followed in Ocala and today, Five Star Pizza has 20+ locations and continues to grow. Five Star Pizza now brings its customers the highest quality pizza in locations from Sarasota to Jacksonville, from Ocala to Ormond Beach.\nFive Star Pizza’s commitment to quality has never wavered, regardless of the cost of ingredients, we always use the best. Although our competitors have shrunk their large pizzas to 15, 14, or even 13 inches, Five Star has continued to make a 16-inch Large and has even introduced an 18- and 24-inch pizza great for families or parties!\nThere are no crazy new products, no gimmicks. Five Star Pizza consistently does what it does best: provides every customer with the highest quality pizza with the highest quality service. As we continue to grow, our commitment to quality remains consistent.\nIt’s our promise,\nOur Slogan:\nBigger, Better, Faster!\nFind Your Location\nabout\nfck\nWhy Us?\n​At Five Star Pizza, we are passionate about our pizzas.
