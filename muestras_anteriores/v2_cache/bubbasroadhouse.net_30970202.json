      "text": "ABOUT US\nHey Bubba!\nOf course we mean you. Bubba does everything in America, from Main Street to the White House; everybody is a Bubba!\nLook around you, Bubba’s Roadhouse is a 90% recycled restaurant – recycled in the sense that America has built some great landmarks in every town. In Fort Myers, there were a couple of old warehouses that were being torn down for “progress.” Bubba was there and negotiated a deal to acquire the old lumber and bricks – some parts of the job are better than others. Bubba the carpenter then took that old plank wood and finished the walls and made the horseshoe bar – hard to believe that it is the same wood.\nAs you can tell, Bubba is also an avid fisherman and hunter. Look around the restaurant and find the birds, fish, deer, coyote and other animals. As you can see, Bubba also wrestled a couple alligators. When you are in the bar area, you will notice that Bubba has been known to drink a beer or two, Bubba’s beer can collection includes some of the great old American breweries from all regions of the country.\nWhen you look back into the kitchen, you can tell that Bubba is a Peterbilt man (sometimes you’ll see his rig in the parking lot). He is on the road a lot but he always comes home to Cape Coral. Bubba brought all those license plates from the great 50 states (some were donated by Bubba’s customers).\nBubba loves America and his stamp is all over this place including the creation of “just good food.” So relax, sit back and enjoy a great evening out. You will soon understand why Bubba’s has been called “America’s Favorite Roadhouse.”\nABOUT US\nHey Bubba!\nOf course we mean you.
