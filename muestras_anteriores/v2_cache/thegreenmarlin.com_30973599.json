We order fresh seafood every day but only enough for one day.\n​\nLou is also the proud owner of\nChive Restaurant\n, in Vero Beach, Florida. Chive is a local favorite for Quick, Creative Cuisine and has been since 2013. If you have not stopped in, try Chive for lunch or dinner. Be sure to keep an eye out for a Chive coming to your neighborhood.\n​\nPrior to opening, Lou spent months painting, cleaning, & personally designing all the artwork throughout the restaurant. Take a few minutes to enjoy the recycled pallets, turned artwork. We hope you feel welcome & enjoy the restaurant as much as we do.\nWe value your opinion & use your feedback to move towards becoming your choice for seafood in Vero Beach.\n​\nDuring the Pandemic, we transformed a portion of our dining room into a market to sell every day grocery items in a smaller environment. This allowed us to keep our employees working and provide meals to our guests.\nWe love this community and will continue to serve our guests within the guidelines provided to ensure everyone's health & safety.\n​\nIn early 2023, we expanded our establishment by opening a Tiki Bar for your outdoor dining pleasure. Please be patient as we work our the dynamics of this new area. During busy times, we may only provide drinks & appetizers while guests wait for their tables. We are working to schedule live music as many nights as possible. We currently have live music scheduled for Fridays, some Thursdays & Saturdays, and continue to expand that schedule.\n​\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\n$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n/$\n$\nabout us\n/$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n/$\n$\nOur Story\n/$\n$\nGreen Marlin Restaurant & Raw Bar opened in August 2017 by owner & operator, Lou Kolbauer.  Our goal was to provide a relaxing atmosphere for Vero Beach residents to be able to enjoy the freshest seafood.  We felt Vero Beach was missing a casual sit-down restaurant that offered fresh oysters & top notch seafood at an affordable price.  We want the Green Marlin to be your first choice in Vero for seafood.
