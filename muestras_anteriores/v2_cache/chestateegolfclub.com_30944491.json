      "text": "COURSE INFORMATION\nChestatee Golf Club is known for its challenging and unique design; each hole has been carefully routed to take advantage of the mountainous terrain while protecting the land’s natural environment.\nThe first hole plays from an elevated tee box to a comfortable landing area. On this dogleg right Par 5, a well-placed tee shot leaves the challenge of making it to the green in two. Chestatee’s signature par 3, 17th hole offers a beautiful view of the Chestatee River before it meets Lake Lanier, while Hole 8 has been dubbed one of the most challenging Par 4s in the state.\nChestatee provides plenty of challenge for high caliber players, however the course can be fun for players of all skill levels, with 5 sets of tees to choose from.\nPer current guidelines, we allow one (1) cart for two (2) players with a maximum of two (2) carts per tee time. Regardless of circumstances, we do not guarantee one (1) cart for one (1) player if requested. Golf shop staff will have final say in determining number of carts allowed per group/tee time.\nCall 706.216.7336 Today to Book Your Tee Time\nCONTACT\nAddress\n: 777 Dogwood Way\nDawsonville, GA 30534\nEmail\n:\nwendy.merry@chestateegolfclub.com\nPhone\n:\n+1-706-216-7336\nHours\n: Daily | 7:30am. – 5:30pm",
