Born in Iowa in 1951, he lived in the Midwest and attended college in New York before moving to Tampa in 1972 with his wife, Dori. Continually painting, his numerous commissioned paintings and murals span from Canada and the US to Europe and the Caribbean and his Fine Art and Plein air paintings have won numerous awards and recognition.\nFadi Diab\nLink to Fadi's Work\nMy name is Fadi Diab, I am an artist living in Tampa Florida. There is nothing I love more than starting with a blank canvas and creating something beautiful. During my childhood, my mother’s closest friend was an artist, there were several pieces of her artwork displayed in our home, she noticed my keen desire to paint, and offered that we do a painting together, I still remember how thrilled I was, painting a seascape at sunset with orange purple sky and scattered palm trees at the seashore, she insisted that I sign the painting and it was hung in our living room. This experience uncovered the artist in me. Wherever I travel, part of my itinerary is to visit art galleries, trying to learn from every artwork I encounter. It wasn’t until 6 years ago that I realized my dream to learn to paint, and ever since, I am either painting or learning a new technique on daily basis.I am mesmerized by textured mixed media art; I experiment with different media to get the texture I want. I use high quality heavy body acrylic paint, acrylic ink and alcohol ink.\nLiving in Florida with its beautiful seascape scenery inspired many of my art pieces, I am fond of painting aerial view seascapes, abstract floral paintings and crackled texture art.\nI create, I imagine, I think, and I have fun!\nI am an artist.\nRachel Dummeldinger\nLink to Rachel's Work\nMy art is an invitation—an opportunity to let your mind relax and let memories and fleeting moments rise to the surface.\nWhat you see in my art comes from a place of profound introspection and a daring willingness to explore the unknown. Each piece is a chapter in my ongoing story, an open book where florals burst into life, abstract shapes tell tales of mystery and wonder, and colors sing with joy. This is my world, a world where art is not just seen but felt.\nI am humbled and thrilled to share my art with you, to invite you into my world where each painting is a snapshot of my story told through color and movement.\nThank you for joining me on this journey.\nLarry Kimbro\nLink to Larry's Work\nFrom an early age I was told that I had an unusual sense of curiosity about life and especially the life around me. Oddly, I was fascinated and read my World Book Encyclopedias (my generations version of surfing the internet) and was fascinated by the likes of multi-disciplines of Leonardo da Vinci and others. Combined with the intense imagination of a young boy and the need to express it led to an endless menagerie of pencil sketches - from exaggerated hot rods to clowns. Inspired by my 7th grade art teacher, Mrs. Lonnie Skipper, I discovered a keen interest in oil painting. Fast-forward almost a decade when I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Auburn University.\nThere, I was exposed to many different art forms and came away with a broader view of the creative world around me. As a true Florida native, I have always been captivated by the lush beauty of nature that surrounds us. From the ever-changing moods of our ocean front to the interruption of peaceful solitude by the cast of a thousand inhabitants within our picturesque back waters, I accepted the challenge to bring creative expression to this and other regional sources of inspiration. While my preferred mediums are oil or acrylic paint on canvas, however, do not be surprised to find where I have ventured into scratch art, pen/ink or an occasional watercolor to satisfy an insatiable appetite for creative expression.\nThrough a realistic interpretation of the subject matter, it is my deep desire to provide the viewer with a moment to escape from the distractions of the day - a safe place to meditate, celebrate and awaken us to the beauty that surrounds us that only the Master Creator could have created in six days and rested on the seventh.\nGabriela Morales\nLink to Gabriela's Work\nArt, to me, is not confined to a single style or subject - it is an evolving language of emotion, a dialogue between color, texture and form. My work traverses landscapes, portraiture, and abstraction, shifting between realism and contemporary experimental approaches, yet always with a singular goal: to evoke emotion.\nEach piece I create is an exploration of the human experience, whether through the quiet serenity of a vast landscape, the raw intimacy of a portrait, or the soul of a moment - every brushstroke breathing life into its subject. Meanwhile, my abstract work embraces the chaos and spontaneity of emotion, inviting viewers to interpret and feel beyond what is seen.\nI believe that art should resonate, not just be observed. Whether through the precision of detail or the freedom of abstraction, my work is a study in contrast - between structure and spontaneity, familiarity and the unknown. Through this interplay, I aim to create a visual and emotional bridge between my are and those who encounter it.\nAt its core, my art is an invitation - to pause, to feel, to see the world through a different lens, if only for a moment.\nJeff Lee Thomson\nLink to Jeff's Work\nMy art comes from all the great artists that have lived before me now living in my spirit.\nI am interested in many forms of art and push myself to make inspirational works that live on long after I do,\nLesli Platt\nLink to Lesli's Work\nI am inspired by my surroundings. I want my art to express nature in a way that incorporates the beauty that I see. My paintings generally will include birds or butterflies, florals, plants and fauna as I see them in life or my minds eye. I am drawn to color, pattern and textures that nature offers. I paint with acrylics because it allows for lots of layering on canvas while painting with glazes on pottery gives an extra element of surprise when the true color is exposed during firing. My art is ever changing and evolving. Every new work is a rediscovery of my need and passion to create.\nJill Ross\nLink to Jill's Work\nFor over 20 years, I have been designing and crafting unique, elegant jewelry inspired by the natural beauty of Maine, my birthplace and lifelong muse. As a skilled metalsmith, I work with silver and gold, incorporating gems, stones, Maine sea glass, and Roman glass to create one-of-a-kind pieces of wearable art. Every piece I create reflects my passion, as I let my hands and soul shape stunning designs that resonate with a wind range of tastes.\nI was fortunate to be mentored by renowned metalsmith Pauline Warg at Warg Enamel & Tool Center in Maine. Over the years, I have dedicated hundreds of hours to workshops and classes, learning from world-renowned jewelry masters. This education, combined with countless hours of hands-on experimentation and exploration, has allowed me to refine my craft and push creative boundaries.\nI spend much of my time in my home studio, meticulously crafting one-of-a-kind designs with a deep appreciation for detail and artistry. When I’m not at my bench, you’ll likely find me fishing or shelling - activities that bring me much joy and inspiration as my art. I live full-time in Cape Coral, Florida, but spend several months each year in Maine with my kids and grandchildren, continuously drawing inspiration from the places I love most.\nRachel Layman\nLink to Rachel's Work\nRachel Layman is dedicated to crafting beautiful, personalized jewelry that tells your story, one piece at a time. Using premium quality material, Rachel captures the essence of life’s most cherished moments. Each piece she designs is not just an accessory; its a reflection of your experiences, emotions, and milestones.\nAndreas Goff\nLink to Andreas's Work\nIn my 35 years of sculpting Native Americans and 25 years of sculpting African figures, my goal as an artist remains the same: to capture the pride and beauty in my subjects, and to honor their cultures.\nMeet our Artists\nTerry Klaaren\nLink to Terry's Work\nAmerican artist Terry Klaaren is a professional artist living and working in the Tampa Bay area and Central Florida for over 40 years.

This education, combined with countless hours of hands-on experimentation and exploration, has allowed me to refine my craft and push creative boundaries.\nI spend much of my time in my home studio, meticulously crafting one-of-a-kind designs with a deep appreciation for detail and artistry. When I’m not at my bench, you’ll likely find me fishing or shelling - activities that bring me much joy and inspiration as my art. I live full-time in Cape Coral, Florida, but spend several months each year in Maine with my kids and grandchildren, continuously drawing inspiration from the places I love most.\nRachel Layman\nLink to Rachel's Work\nRachel Layman is dedicated to crafting beautiful, personalized jewelry that tells your story, one piece at a time. Using premium quality material, Rachel captures the essence of life’s most cherished moments. Each piece she designs is not just an accessory; its a reflection of your experiences, emotions, and milestones.\nAndreas Goff\nLink to Andreas's Work\nIn my 35 years of sculpting Native Americans and 25 years of sculpting African figures, my goal as an artist remains the same: to capture the pride and beauty in my subjects, and to honor their cultures.\nRed Calliope Gallery on Evers\n109 S.
