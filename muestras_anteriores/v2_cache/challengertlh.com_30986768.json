Now IMAX Entertainment proudly presents a thrilling new abridged version of the documentary “The Blue Angels” taking audiences soaring with the Navy’s elite Flight Demonstration Squadron in breathtaking IMAX 2D & 3D presentations. Filmed for IMAX, the immersive footage puts you in the cockpit for a firsthand view of the Blue Angels’ precision flying, while the aerial shots deliver a spectacular showcase of the breathtaking maneuvers that have made them the world’s premier jet team. The Blue Angels also takes audiences behind the scenes for a revealing, in-depth look at what it takes to become a Blue Angel—from the careful selection process to the challenging training regimen, and on through the demanding eight-month show season. The film is a fitting tribute to the extraordinary teamwork, passion and pride of the hundreds of\noutstanding men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps who have had the honor to serve in the Blue Angels squadron…past, present, and future.\nFilm Details\nRun time: 40 minutes\nRating: G\nFormat: 3D\nThis program sponsored in part through COCA’s Cultural Grant Program funded by the City of Tallahassee and Leon County.\nYour ticket purchase supports the Challenger Learning Center’s community outreach and educational programming.\nThe Blue Angels\nIMAX® 3D | Documentary\nShowtimes\nEducator Guide",

Vancore\nOur family has been a member of the Challenger Learning Center since 2013 and we have enjoyed many programs: planetarium shows, IMAX documentaries, SCIturdays and members-only special events offered by the wonderful staff at Challenger. We are proud supporters of the Challenger mission…Being a member of Challenger has had a positive impact on our family…We plan to renew our membership and continue supporting the Challenger Learning Center’s initiatives. We are excited to see what they do next.\nRuss & Ruchi Rhodes\nWe have enjoyed working with the CLC over the last fourteen (14) years. We include a visit to the Challenger Learning Center for many of our groups booking a trip to the Tallahassee area. Your programs are educational and fun for the many students we serve each year.\nMarta Kendall\nTour Coordinator\n,\nSonshine Educational Tours, Coral Springs, FL\nI’m a retired middle school science teacher and I am happy to report that I took my 6th grade students to “fly a mission” for many, many years, where they simulated being an astronaut… The Challenger Learning Center also offers many workshops for enrichment. Among my favorite ones tied literature with science… The CLC is unique and a definite asset to our community. My family and I will continue to support their programs and mission.\nIrene Klay\nI visit the Challenger Learning Center on a regular basis. The CLC has provided learning opportunities designed for all ages, not only K-12 students. I am a member of the Tallahassee Astronomical Society and consistently attend the free showing of Monthly Skies Over Tallahassee. We are lucky to have access to such a fine planetarium in the Tallahassee community. The CLC is an asset to our community and provides unique programming. I will continue to support their programs and overall mission.\nDayle Coxen\nThe Challenger Learning Center has opened up the universe for people of all abilities. As Executive Director of the Florida Disabled Outdoors Association, I want to let you know that our members are always welcomed at the many programs they have attended. The Challenger Learning Center is an asset to our community and provides unique programming. I will continue to support their programs and mission.\nLaurie LoRe-Gussak\nExecutive Director\n,\nFlorida Disabled Outdoors Association\nEducator Testimonials\nTestimonials are received through customer surveys following programming.\nThe Challenger Center always provides a highly engaging experience for the kids! Additionally, they are well organized and make the process of bringing the kids there very simple!\nThe Center provides engaging, relevant, and lasting learning experiences for students of all ages. Allowing students to connect to the history of the space program by learning about the Challenger experience and about our universe at large, leaves a lasting learning experience for children who may otherwise not encounter this information in the classroom.\nThe children are always engaged and learning. The staff is very easy to work with. It is a wonderful experience for everyone involved!\nChallenger Learning Center is a great place to inspire students and open their minds about various science topics.\nNot only did [our field trip] meet all of our Florida standards, but it also brought the abstract world of our universe into the hands of our students. They were able to almost touch and feel what it is really like in outer space.\nThe mission [simulation] gives every student the opportunity to be successful. Even the students least likely to participate get excited and understand their part in making the mission successful.\nThe staff is friendly, very accommodating, and encouraging to our students.\n[The field trip] has always been a great experience, from the planning staff to the people that greet you when you walk in.\nWonderful facility, amazing films and excellent customer service. What more could we want?\nOur trip to the CLC was one of the most engaging field trips that my students have ever participated in. Students were engaged in hands-on learning disguised as fun. In addition, the content was tightly correlated to eight grade science standards, providing a concrete shared experience to later serve as a launching point for mental reference.\nThe students enjoyed themselves. We have a great experience each year. This is the fifth year I have been planning field trips for Pre-K and the CLC is always first on my list.\nMy students loved [our field trip] and it sparked their interest in science. That’s all they can talk about.\nTestimonials\nEducator Testimonials\nTestimonials are received through customer surveys following programming.",
