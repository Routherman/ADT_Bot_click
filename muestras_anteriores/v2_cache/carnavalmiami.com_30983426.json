They wanted to be heard. They wanted to be different. They wanted to change the world.\nArmed with a vision and hard work, they started Calle Ocho Music Festival, which soon became the largest Hispanic festival in the country. Soon after, all-time partner The Miami Herald suggested to expand the party to a larger audience and Carnaval Miami was born as the platform for all shapes of art, music, fashion, cuisine, and sports.\nToday, the economic impact of Carnaval Miami extends to $40M, ever year. Its community impact is priceless! Carnaval Miami funds projects that change children’s lives, from sports leagues to summer camps, the distribution of school supplies, college scholarships and help in unforeseeable family situations.\nCarnaval Miami is powered by the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana and its proceeds benefit the Kiwanis of Little Havana Foundation.\nOUR MISSION\nKiwanis empowers communities to improve the world by making lasting differences in the lives of children.\nTHE KIWANIS VISION\nKiwanis will be a positive influence in communities worldwide—so that one day, all children will wake up in communities that believe in them, nurture them and provide the support they need to thrive.\nKIWANIS OF LITTLE HAVANA FOUNDATION\nThe Kiwanis Club of Little Havana established the Kiwanis of Little Havana Foundation in 1987 with the mission to further assist the financially underserved Hispanic youth of Miami-Dade County. Since its inception, the Foundation has provided thousands of children each year with the opportunity to learn, dream, grow, succeed and thrive through education, technology, health and overall goodwill programs.\nSTAFF\nNicole R.
