This transformation was made possible thanks to assistance provided by the Florida Inland Navigation District (FIND), through grants awarded in 2015, 2016 and 2019, totaling approximately $700,000.\nThe Florida Inland Navigation District is the state agency responsible for maintaining the Intracoastal Waterway navigation channel in the 12 counties on the east coast of Florida. One of the key roles of FIND is to assist governments in the development of waterway accesses and related improvement projects (boat ramps, docks, fishing piers, shoreline erosion).\nRenovations\nThe renovations at Phipps Park have been completed in several phases:\nIn 2018, 1,800 feet of shoreline were graded and stabilized with a paved walking pathway along the shoreline. In addition, a fishing pier was built, 51 trees were transplanted, and 28 RV sites were created that provided 50-amp electrical service.\nIn 2019, the boat ramp was completely renovated, making it accessible with new docks and a ramp.\nIn 2020, the county built 19 adventure platform tents in the Stormwater Treatment Area and renovated the small restroom.\nIn 2022, the remaining 800 feet of shoreline were stabilized with a paved walking path and a new floating boat dock along the shoreline. The previous overhead electrical lines and poles were removed throughout the park, and new electrical was installed at each of the 98 RV sites. Lighting was also added to the roadway around the park. Septic-to-sewer conversion was completed with sewer hook-ups at each site. Water service was also added to each RV site. The roadway and each RV site were graded with drainage areas, and the roadway was resurfaced with millings. Landscaping and irrigation were added throughout the park, with 143 new native oak and pine trees planted and 94 transplanted sabal palms. Additionally, the county adopted a new online reservation platform for Phipps Park through Reserve America, which was launched on November 22, 2022, when the park reopened to the public.  As part of this phase, the county is waiting on the delivery and installation of the electrical pedestals for sites 25–99. They are expected to be installed before June 2023.\nIn 2023, the design of a new building with restrooms, showers, laundry and an added maintenance shop and storage is going out for bid. WiFi access and front gate security cameras will also be added to the park in 2023.\nA new General Store building with a BBQ/social deck, campfire area and caretaker’s residence on the second story has been designed. Construction is estimated to start in 2024.\nCommunity Impact\nMartin County and its residents will benefit from these improvements in many ways:\nEnvironmentally, from the conversion of septic to sewer, the removal of exotics and the planting of native trees and shrubs.\nRecreationally, the shoreline improvements provide public access to the waterways with new docks, boat ramp, walking path along the shoreline and additional camping opportunities.\nResiliency comes from the hardening of the infrastructure, shoreline stabilization and grading of the roadway.\nAccessibility Statement\nMartin County is committed to ensuring website accessibility for people with disabilities.

Martin, Governor of Florida from 1925 to 1929.\nBy the authority of the Constitution of the State of Florida, the Martin County Board of County Commissioners shares the functions of government with Martin County’s Constitutional Officers.\nMartin County’s five Commissioners are each elected to serve a four-year term. These terms are staggered and each member is elected at-large but represents a geographic district within the county.\nThe Chairperson of the Commission is elected annually by the other Board members and presides over all Board meetings. The Board meets on several Tuesdays each month and all meetings are open to the public.\nThe Board of County Commissioners has responsibility for the provision of general government services (fire/rescue, library services, building inspections), oversees the development of infrastructure (roads, utilities, parks), and determines regulations regarding zoning and land use provisions.\nThe Board is also responsible for determining the millage rate (tax on real property) to fund all functions of County government with the exception of the Tax Collector and most court-related functions.\nThe Board of County Commissioners is a policymaking board and they approve the County’s operating and capital budgets, pass ordinances, and take actions that provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Martin County.\nMartin County Vision Statement:\nMartin County government is value and service driven. Martin County will be known locally, regionally, statewide and nationally as an innovative and progressive leader, providing cost-effective County services. Others will benchmark against Martin County as an example of the best in local government. The citizens and the Board of County Commissioners will be proud of the staff and have a firm belief in the reliability, truth and strength of the organization.\nAccessibility Statement\nMartin County is committed to ensuring website accessibility for people with disabilities.
