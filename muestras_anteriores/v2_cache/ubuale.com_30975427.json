Since 1996, the LPP&B has been Lake Placid’s pub of choice, with the freshest microbrewed ales and lagers, including the famous Ubu Ale, and traditional pub fare sure to please everyone. You will always find Ubu Ale on tap at the Pub, and frequently will find favorites such as Moose Island Ale, 46’er Pale Ale, and Lake Placid IPA. We also feature many rotating seasonal beers such as Leaping Cow ESB, Twice Bitten Barleywine, Ectoberfest Lager, Maibock, High Peaks Hefeweizen, and Dr. Fogg’s Oatmeal Stout. We have brewed more than 150 different styles of beer over our 28+ years in business.\nOn the second floor at the LPP&B, experience what Skiing magazine calls “a top-quality brewpub.” Have a great meal, enjoy an award-winning beer, and just sit in front of the stone fireplace and relax. In the summer, kick back on our deck overlooking beautiful Mirror Lake or under the tent in our beer garden. Downstairs at the LPP&B, experience the legendary P.J. O’Neill’s, a true Irish pub with the warm character of aged wood and brick. In business for almost 40 years, the downstairs bar is a favorite for locals and visitors alike. And now enjoy our third floor, The Hop Loft, opened in February of 2013, featuring another outdoor deck overlooking the lake, another bar and seating area, as well as a kids room featuring activities to keep the toddlers busy while you enjoy your time at the Pub. Three stories of fun, and all accessible by our elevator.\nAsk a local where to find the best food in Lake Placid and they will steer you to the Lake Placid Pub & Brewery. Our menu features pub classics like an assortment of detroit-style deep dish pizzas, mouthwatering cheeseburgers, and the best wings this side of Buffalo. Other favorites include Fish & Chips, Shepherds Pie, Josh’s Fire Fish, and more. And don’t worry about the little ones — they can choose from our “Brewmaster in Training” selections such as grilled cheese or chicken fingers.\nOur Beer\nOur Food\nOur chefs source most of our ingredients locally, and we offer the freshest food in the area. This is not your typical pub grub, but it is approachable and delicious. Our menu features snacks, salads, sandwiches, brick-oven pizzas and delicious entrees.\nMany items on our menu are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free for those with special dietary needs.\nOur Menu\nOrder Online\nOur Location\nHours\nMonday – 11:30am – 12am\nFull Menu until 10pm\nTuesday – 11:30am – 12am\nFull Menu until\n10pm\nWednesday – 11:30am – 12am\nFull Menu until\n10pm\nThursday – 11:30am – 12am\nFull Menu until\n10pm\nFriday – 11:30am – 2am\nFull Menu until 10pm\nSaturday – 11:30am – 2am\nFull Menu until 10pm\nSunday – 12pm – 12am\nFull Menu until\n10pm\nSeating at the Pub is always on a first come, first serve basis – sorry, no reservations are accepted, but you can add yourself to the Yelp waitlist\nhere\n.\n813 Mirror Lake Dr,\nLake Placid, NY 12946\n518-523-3813\nContact Us\nOur Founder\nChristopher & Catherine Ericson officially opened Big Slide in June of 2016.
