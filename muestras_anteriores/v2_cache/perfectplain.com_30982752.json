The land nearly as white as flour but productive of fine peaches, oranges in abundance, grapes, figs, pomegranates, etc. Fine flowers grow spontaneously, for they have neglected the gardens, expecting a change of government. The town is immediately on the bay-the most beautiful water prospect I ever saw; and from 10 o’clock in the morning until 10 at night we have the finest sea breeze. There is something in it so exhilarating, so pure, so wholesome, it enlivens the whole system.” - Rachel Jackson, July 23, 1821\nAbout Our Taproom\nLocated in the heart of downtown Pensacola, our facility is the original location of Perfect Plain Brewing Company’s brewery and taproom.\nDesigned to bring people together in a spacious, welcome environment, the taproom is a fully immersive experience with long communal tables and our entire 10-barrel brewhouse exposed within the gathering area. Portions of our building date back more than 75 years, and architectural signs of decades’ past have been preserved in our space.\nWe completed our taproom with an expansive, dog friendly patio facing historic Garden Street.\nIn 1764, when Garden Street was the northern border of Pensacola’s small downtown core, any resident who purchased land was given a companion parcel to use for a garden. To this day, the boundary lines of Perfect Plain’s space fits the original “Garden lot” dimensions.\nAbout Garden & Grain\nLocated directly behind Perfect Plain Brewing Co., Garden & Grain is our cocktail garden and private event space.
