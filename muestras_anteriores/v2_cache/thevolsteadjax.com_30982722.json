Considered one of America’s biggest mistakes, the act was later repealed in 1933 but the era would forever leave its mark on history.\nSo why open a prohibition-style lounge in Downtown Jacksonville, you might ask? It’s not every day that a group of young entrepreneurs can influence and be a part of the revival of one of America’s largest cities. Why not throwback to an era of elegance, prosperity, and change? To a time in which life felt like it was moving in fast forward, back when youth and culture were first celebrated and in the most prosperous and exciting period this city had ever seen. We here at The Volstead are striving to revive this time of elegance and intimacy, as we turn down the house music and let you guys talk to each other while an old jazz album plays in the background. We want to bring back the art and craft of classic cocktails. We tossed the chemical flavored booze, got the largest collection of small-batch whiskey our shelves could hold and hit the farmer’s market looking for interesting ingredients and pairings rarely seen in a glass. Let us give you a feel of what was happening behind closed doors in our own river city almost one hundred years ago.\nWe hope you sit back, relax, and let us take your senses back to what was once good, and as it turns out, still is. So why you ask?
