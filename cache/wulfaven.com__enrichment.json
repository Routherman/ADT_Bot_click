        "description": "Wulfaven Brewing Company is our family owned craft brewery. What does Wulfaven mean, you ask? Well, it’s a combination of two words: Wolf and Haven. The wolf is a symbol of a teacher, the sharing of knowledge, and a never-ending journey. Of course, wolves also depend on their pack and so do we. Our family, friends, and community is our inner circle. Without them, we wouldn’t have made it thus far. The second word, haven, is our safe place. Our third home. The place where we can gather with our wolfpack and unwind from the day.",
