          "description": "Goodwood Museum & Gardens is a wonderful place to visit, for locals and visitors alike! Come by for a tour of our 170 year old Main House or a stroll through our lovely gardens. We're also a great place to host your next event!\n\nGoodwood Museum & Gardens is situated on sixteen acres of sprawling lawns, gardens and centuries old live oaks. In addition to the Main House, there are thirteen outbuildings, a roller rink and reflecting pool.\n\nThe estate began in the 1830s as a cotton and corn plantation that ultimately encompassed 2,400 acres. The plantation’s agricultural emphasis declined after the Civil War and by the 1880s the remaining 160 acres, home, and garden served as an elegant private residence. In 1911, the house and garden underwent major renovation. The estate’s style and elegance was further enhanced by Goodwood’s owners in the late 1920s. Goodwood is currently restored to this turn-of-the-century Country Estate era, ever mindful of its rich 19th-century history.",
