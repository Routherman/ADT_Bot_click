          "description": "The Rubell Museums in Miami and DC house the Rubell family’s extensive collection, one of the world’s largest, privately owned, publicly accessible contemporary art collections. Since 1993, the Rubell Family has exhibited their expanding collection in Miami with annual exhibitions, showcasing a distinguished range of contemporary art. The Rubell Museum’s artist-in-residence program was established in 2011 as a continuation of the Museum’s mission to support emerging artists, spotlight a diverse mix of contemporary voices, and encourage public dialogue.\n\nIn 2022, the Rubell family established a second museum in the nation’s capital in the historic former Randall Junior High School in Southwest D.C. The 32,000 square foot museum includes galleries, a bookstore, and flexible activation spaces to host contemporary art programming and community-centered events, talks, and workshops.",
