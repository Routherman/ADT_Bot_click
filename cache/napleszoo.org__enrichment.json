Wildlife from anteaters to zebras live within this historic botanical garden founded in 1919 where guests can wander the paths, learn from animal care staff, and embark on a guided cruise through islands of primates. Its conservation and education mission focuses on programs that create a better future for both people and wildlife. With the support of visitors, members, and donors, Naples Zoo has invested over 2 million dollars saving plants and animals in the wild since 2014.
