          "description": "Thank you for your interest in Cimarrone Golf and Country Club.  Established in 1988, Cimarrone is a semi private club whose mission is to provide a private club experience for its members and guests.\nThe golf course is a David Poselthwait championship design that meanders through the pine forests and thick marshlands of north Florida.  The 6,900 yard layout plays along a mildly rolling terrain with significant fairway and green side mounds and plentiful water hazards.  Rated 4 stars out of five by Golf Digest Places to Play, the course was chosen as one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in Florida.\nGolf amenities include practice facilities that feature a targeted natural grass range, short game areas with sand bunker, and putting green.\nIn addition, Cimarrone Golf and Country Club has a 10,000 square foot clubhouse that features a beautiful restaurant and lounge, plus banquet and golf outing facilities that can accommodate over 140 people.  The clubhouse can be made available for use by our members at a discounted rate.\nCimarrone Golf and Country Club membership opportunities are being offered for a limited time.  There are a number of options….something for everyone.\nWe would like to invite you to explore all that Cimarrone has to offer.  Hit some range balls, play a round of golf, grab a hand crafted deli sandwich and a cold drink.  We think you will agree Cimarrone Golf and Country Club is one of the best kept secrets in Northeast Florida.\nTo arrange, simply call the Pro Shop at 904-287-2000 and ask for Jerry Saffell or Lynn Mobley and they will take care of the rest.  \nWe hope to see you soon.",
