          "description": "Freedom Boat Club, a division of Brunswick Corporation (NYSE: BC) and headquartered in Venice, FL., is the world’s oldest and largest boat club with more than 400 locations in the U.S., Canada, France, United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark, and Australia. The club serves more than 100,000 members.  \n\nWe believe that days do not have to be ordinary and boating should be an escape rather than a nuisance. To us, boating is a way for people to relax, connect with friends and create powerful memories with family.\n\nSo in 1989 we brought that philosophy to life with Freedom Boat Club, the world's largest members-only boating club. With Freedom Boat Club, you don’t need a lot of time to enjoy boating. Just get to the dock. We’ll have a boat waiting for you, fueled up and ready to go.\n\nWe boast numerous locations from seashores to lake shores. From one Sarasota, Florida location in 1989, Freedom has grown to over 400+ locations throughout the world.  Each provides you with a fleet of boats that come with less stress and a lower price tag than owning a single boat. We clean, maintain, store, and do all the prep work for your enjoyment. There are no hassles like dock fees, insurance or trailers. Instead, you spend your time having fun on the water.  And when you join one Club you join them all.  You have the freedom to explore the world's best shores, lakes, and rivers.\n\nAt Freedom Boat Club, the boat is waiting. Why are you?",
