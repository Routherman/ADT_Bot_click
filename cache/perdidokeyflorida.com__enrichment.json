          "description": "A little about our company... Perdido Key Resort Management is here to provide all the help and southern hospitality you need from a rental company.  We believe that the best advice comes from real people. That’s why, in addition to being available over the phone and via email to answer your questions, we’ve made it easy to learn from vacationers who’ve gone before you.  Read the unfiltered online reviews on each individual property page to get the inside scoop on the condos.  How is this done?  We send out a request for feedback following your trip and post the comments left online. These comments left by previous Perdido Key vacation goers, possibly much like yourself, should help to make your trip even better than you had planned as through their feedback you will have insight on what to do and where to go even before you arrive.  Additionally, transparency is important to us so these reviews from our guests are valuable to us in making improvements wherever necessary.",
