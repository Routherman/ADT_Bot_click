The Orlando Museum of Art will be a cultural leader in the Central Florida community and beyond. Through exhibition of art and educational programming, it aspires to teach, influence, and broaden the worldview and shared experience of our community.\n\nAnnually, the museum presents 10-12 exhibitions on-site and 13 exhibitions off-site, award-winning art enrichment programs, unlimited gallery tours, teacher in-service training programs, video programs, distinguished lectures, art appreciation lectures, studio classes, lecture/luncheon programs and outreach services in its facility and throughout the community. The services benefit individuals, including visitors from all 67 counties in Florida, the other 49 states and numerous foreign countries. These programs are implemented by the museum’s staff, its Board of Trustees and more than 700 volunteers, many of whom are part of its membership of 5,000 individuals.",
