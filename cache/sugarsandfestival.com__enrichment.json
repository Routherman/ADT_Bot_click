          "description": "Sunsets at Pier 60 debuted on March 17, 1995 as a year-round nightly sunset celebration on the iconic Pier 60. This 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization serves as a free, family-friendly destination for tourists and locals to experience.\n\nDuring its nearly 25-year history, Sunsets at Pier 60 has produced numerous special events such as Beach Fest, Caribbean Christmas Art Show and FantaSea of Lights. In 2013, the nightly sunset celebration created a new destination event in partnership with the city of Clearwater called the Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival.\n\nThe Sugar Sand Festival is a 17-day beach wide celebration of Clearwater Beach’s two most notable natural assets: our sugar sand and sunsets. More than 14 sand sculptors use 1,000 tons of Clearwater Beach sand to create a walk-through art exhibit housed in a 21,000-square-foot structure. The event also raises money for the community and supports the educational initiatives of the Sunsets at Pier 60 Daily Festival.\n\nThe Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival is the largest destination event on Clearwater Beach attracting over 200,000 visitors over 17 days and has a $32,837,900 economic impact to the community.",
