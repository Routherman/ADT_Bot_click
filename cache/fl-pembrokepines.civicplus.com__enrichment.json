          "description": "CivicPlus is the only government technology company exclusively committed to powering and empowering governments to efficiently operate, serve, and govern through the use of our innovative and integrated technology solutions purpose-built and supported by former municipal leaders and award-winning support teams. \n\nWhen many residents hear the word government, they think of federal and state leaders and agencies. However, in reality, residents interact more with the local leaders whose work and initiatives impact them directly where they live, work, play, and raise their families.\n\nAt CivicPlus®️, we believe that every interaction between residents and their local government should be exceptional and frictionless. It’s why we build technology solutions designed to foster positive and powerful civic experiences. \n\nWith more than 20 years of experience, CivicPlus has earned the trust of over 12,000 customers, their 100,000+ local government users, and their 340 million+ residents in the U.S. and Canada alone.",
