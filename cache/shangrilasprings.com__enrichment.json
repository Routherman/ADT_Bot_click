          "description": "Built in 1926, Shangri-La Springs is a historic hotel located on more than 8 acres in the heart of beautiful Bonita Springs, Florida. Our stately property offers a boutique hotel experience and a variety of unique services including an organic restaurant, full-service organic spa, organic garden and meeting & event spaces.\n\nOur historic property has long been known for its invigorating and restorative powers. The Spa at Shangri-La Springs offers organic serenity whether you’re looking for rejuvenation or relaxation, you’ll feel like you’ve turned back the clock in more ways than one. Enjoy a full complement of organic spa treatments by our highly skilled and licensed staff. \n\nOur organic farm-to-table restaurant, Harvest & Wisdom, provides a menu crafted with seasonal produce picked fresh from our on-site organic garden along with locally-sourced organic proteins and beverages.\n\nThe history of the springs begins hundreds of years ago with the Calusa Indians who were the original inhabitants of this area. They used the natural spring water for medicinal and trading purposes. Then, in the early 1500s, Juan Ponce De Leon discovered the spring in his quest for the Fountain of Youth. Many believe the natural mineral waters running through the spring have special healing properties.\n\nThis natural mineral spring, which is still flowing on the property today, is the very spring for which the city was named – Bonita Springs.",
